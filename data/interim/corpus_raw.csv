2016-03-09T00:00:00Z,Pregnancy Requires Major Changes in the Quality of the Diet for Nutritional Adequacy: Simulations in the French and the United States Populations,"['Pregnancy tends to markedly widen the nutritional gap. The decrease in the nutritional adequacy of observed diets of women of childbearing age cannot be solved by a simple increase in energy intake, as recommended in some countries. A relatively good nutritional adequacy in pregnant women can therefore not be simply attributed to a higher energy intake, but to qualitative changes in the diet. Recommendations of snack additions from public health agencies make a somewhat limited and an extremely variable contribution to tackling the nutritional gap during pregnancy. These results call for dedicated studies to define the most theoretically efficient dietary counselling during pregnancy on a methodologically sound basis, either as generic counselling for the whole population or as tailor-fitted advice at the individual level, to improve the nutritional adequacy of the diet which is jeopardized at this specific, critical stage of the life cycle.']"
2016-08-23T00:00:00Z,Continental-Scale Patterns Reveal Potential for Warming-Induced Shifts in Cattle Diet,"['In all, given the geographic patterns in diet, it appears that as climates warm, cattle will respond in part by increasing their relative consumption of protein from high-protein eudicots to compensate for declines in protein concentrations in grasses. As protein concentrations appear to have already been declining in grasslands for decades due to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations [38], warming and elevated CO2 concentrations are likely reinforcing nutritional stress in cattle, though the degree to which cattle nutritional stress may have increased is currently unquantified. Monitoring the diet of cattle likely will be an important component in responding to climate-induced nutritional stresses as increases in forb component of diets might indicate elevated nutritional stress. Mitigating nutritional stress will likely require altered management practices such as promoting high-protein plant species, altered use of fire [39], or increasing protein concentrations of grasses, possibly through fertilization. With increases in eudicot percentages in diets, more attention will need to be paid to the role of secondary compounds in dietary selection and nutrition [6]. Given the patterns observed here, some management practices, such as broad-scale application of herbicides to reduce eudicot abundance, might be deleterious nutritionally and an improper response to reduced nutritional quality of forage.']"
2015-06-17T00:00:00Z,Assessing Nutritional Parameters of Brown Bear Diets among Ecosystems Gives Insight into Differences among Populations,"['Previous studies have illustrated the differences in brown bear diets and their correlation with life history traits and population densities [1, 7, 11, 18, 73]. However, the specific nutritional differences of brown bear diets between populations have not been previously quantified or assessed for the entire active period. This study is one of the first to compare ecosystem-specific brown bear diets based on the relative sources of digestible energy and protein for several interior populations. Noticeable differences in the nutritional parameters of brown bear diets were observed among several interior ecosystems, and the patterns observed suggest that individual body size and population density may be influenced by the availability of protein early in the season (by supporting lean mass gain and lactation) and the availability of energy late in the season (by supporting fat mass gain before hibernation).Small changes in the availability of highly nutritious foods have important effects on the nutritional quality of bear diets, such as the reduction or loss of terrestrial meats, trout and pine nuts in the GYE. Changes in nutritional quality will have an even greater impact when food availability and foraging efficiency do not permit increased consumption of less nutritious foods to offset the reduction in nutritional quality. Due to the importance of the nutritional conditions on bear fitness [12, 73] and population productivity [39, 44], monitoring food availability and foraging and dietary patterns of brown bears should be a permanent part of management programs.']"
2015-04-17T00:00:00Z,"The Self-Reported Clinical Practice Behaviors of Australian Optometrists as Related to Smoking, Diet and Nutritional Supplementation","['The present study provides a valuable insight into the current self-reported practice behaviors of Australian optometrists, as related to smoking and nutrition. The findings suggest that many practitioners do not routinely ask their patients about smoking status, nor do they provide counseling with regard to smoking cessation; younger optometrists (20 to 29 years of age) were less likely to enquire about smoking behaviors than older practitioners. Overall, optometrists tended to provide patient advice in relation to diet and nutritional supplementation slightly more regularly than for smoking. Almost two-thirds of respondents indicated routinely counseling patients about their diet; practitioners who consumed nutritional supplements themselves were no more likely to discuss the use of dietary supplements with their patients. These findings highlight scope to improve patient-related guidance in relation to smoking, diet and nutritional supplementation in Australian optometric practice.']"
2017-10-09T00:00:00Z,The impact of nutritional supplement intake on diet behavior and obesity outcomes,"['Our study shows that the propensity to consume nutritional supplements is a function of diet quality, health, demographic and lifestyle factors. Our findings also suggest a possible link between diet-health behavior (supplement intake) and obesity status as measured by BMI. Thus, consumers of diet supplements do show a lower BMI compared to non-takers. Given decreasing intake levels of fruits and vegetables, it is important to determine the role nutritional supplements play in health behavior and in determining diet quality outcomes.Indeed, we find that nutritional supplements intake may have a positive effect on diet quality of supplement consumers, which in turn may affect diet health outcome indicators, such as the BMI. However, the effect of supplement intake as an explicit health behavior does not significantly alter the levels of overall diet quality or any of its important sub-components observed in this study. This finding expands the results commonly found in consumer stated preference surveys on diet-health in that a direct linkage between preventative health behaviors and the consumption of fruits and vegetables exists [10].However, the estimated differences in obesity and diet quality outcomes between nutritional supplement takers and no-takers should not be interpreted as the causal effect of supplementation. Instead, the binary supplement intake variable in the PSM analysis represents a proxy of individual’s (supplement taker’s) health behaviour, which results in significant differences in the chosen outcomes when compared against a control (non-taker) population.The results of the analysis suggest that several health indicators, demographics, and lifestyle variables significantly affect the selection into the treatment group of nutritional supplement takers. Nutritional supplement intake is positively associated with a significantly lower BMI of above 1kg/ (body height in meters)2, when all other observable characteristics between supplement takers and non-takers are controlled for. We also found that supplement takers are likely to be white, highly educated, of higher household income, non-smokers and of overall higher health status.The findings reveal that food stamp recipients and lower income households do not take nutritional supplements, even though these two groups may be especially at-risk groups of failing to meet recommended intake levels for major fresh food categories (e.g. fresh fruits and vegetables). On the other hand, individuals of normal weight (individuals with a lower BMI) and individuals who consume more fruits were found to proactively hedge against health risks by consuming nutritional supplements a preventative measure for maintaining good health. One way to encourage consumption of nutritional supplements among at-risk groups would be to establish a health policy on consumption, especially with regards to fruits and vegetables and nutritional supplements, in order to target specific at-risk populations.Given the increasing importance of individuals’ dietary choices to consumer diet-health and public policy in the United States, accurate estimates of existing behaviors and their impacts on relevant health outcomes have become essential tools for the purpose of policy guidance. Moreover, greater general awareness of diet-health issues and trends toward proactive health behaviors have increased consumers’ demand for more products with identifiable health benefits (e.g. superfoods, functional foods). This trend towards “nutritionism” [77] demands significant adjustments on the side of stakeholders along many agri-food value chains. Given the recent volatility in the in the U.S. produce sector, growth opportunities related to diet-health trends should be of even greater important to the fresh fruit and vegetable industry. In this context knowledge of the determinants of nutritional supplement demand seems particularly essential.Finally, a key component in the quest for improving food policies is the improvement in analytical methods aimed at eliminating the self-selection bias and resulting mismeasurement commonly associated with working with cross-sectional observational data, such as NHANES. The econometric analysis carried out in this article contributes to the discussion regarding whether consuming supplements leads to positive diet-health outcomes. Appropriate methods such as treatment effects estimators (e.g. PSM) can provide more reliable insights into an individual’s diet and health behavior, which will provide the prerequisite for effective and efficient public policies.']"
2017-01-25T00:00:00Z,"Diet and ADHD, Reviewing the Evidence: A Systematic Review of Meta-Analyses of Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trials Evaluating the Efficacy of Diet Interventions on the Behavior of Children with ADHD","['Based on double-blind placebo-controlled evidence our systematic review shows that the effect sizes of AFC-free diets (small to medium) and PUFA supplementation (negligible to small) warrant the conclusion that as yet these interventions should not be advised as general ADHD treatment. Conversely, the effect sizes of a few-foods diet are medium to large, justifying implementation of a diagnostic FFD in subgroups of children with ADHD, thus offering innovative treatment opportunities for ADHD. Further FFD research should focus on the mechanism of food in children with ADHD. Finding pathways may result in an easier diagnostic procedure to differentiate between diet responders and nonresponders, in an easier therapeutic approach in children responding to foods and in a personalized disease strategy. The findings of this review are in line with the position of the International Society for Nutritional Psychiatry Research, recently stating that there is ‘emerging and compelling evidence for nutrition as a crucial factor’ in mental disorders, and suggesting that ‘consideration of nutrition should be part of standard practice’ [130].']"
2019-01-15T00:00:00Z,Plant-based (vegan) diets for pets: A survey of pet owner attitudes and feeding practices,"['This study represents the first investigation into the prevalence of meat-avoidance in the pet owner population. The prevalence of vegetarianism and veganism was higher in the pet owner sample than has been reported in the general population, accounting for approximately 12% of pet owners in the sample population. To put that into perspective, in the USA alone, with its population of 325 million [98] and a national a pet-owning rate estimated at 56% [54], there may be as many as 20 million vegetarian and vegan pet owners. Given that the concerns regarding animal-based pet foods reported by vegan and vegetarian pet owners surveyed appear to be the same concerns that they feel regarding animal-products in their own diets, a large number of these pet owners likely desire alternative diets for their pets. Indeed, nearly one-quarter of vegan pet owners reported currently feeding their pets a plant-based diet, while almost half of those who indicated they did not currently do so reported that they would if there were a plant-based diet available which met their standards. For the majority of pet owners interested in feeding a plant-based diet to their pet, the major obstacle was a lack of evidence of nutritional sufficiency. These results suggest a discordance between perceived or real availability of suitable plant-based pet foods and the demand for evidence-based complete and balanced plant-based pet foods. It is clear that an association exists between the diet a pet owner has chosen to follow and the diet they choose to feed their pet. Nutritional sufficiency of most plant-based diets has yet to be demonstrated, while few studies have investigated the short or long-term effects of plant-based diets on pet health. Considering the number of pet owners found to be feeding, or interested in feeding, plant-based diets to pets, and the implications on pet health, nutrition, and the pet food market, more research is warranted regarding plant-based foods for dogs and cats.']"

Diet based interventions may be beneficial in obese and overweight pregnant women. Nutritional supplements such as probiotics and myo-inositol show benefit and need further evaluation in large randomised trials.']
2016-09-09T00:00:00Z,Maternal Dietary Patterns and Practices and Birth Weight in Northern Ghana,"['Poor dietary practices during pregnancy such as ‘pica’ and ‘out of home eating’ were found to be associated with increase odds for low birth weight. We also identified two dietary patterns among pregnant women in Northern Ghana. These are Health conscious diet and non-health conscious diet. Women dietary diversity score and dietary patterns were found to be protective against low birth weight. Our findings buttress the importance of optimal nutrition during pregnancy. Therefore, it is important that emphasis should be placed on counseling and assisting pregnant women and prospective mothers to practice optimal nutrition through the consumption of foods across the various food groups that are good sources of both macro and micronutrients during nutrition counseling in antenatal clinics more so in Ghana.']"
2019-12-12T00:00:00Z,"Protein, dietary fiber, minerals, antioxidant pigments and phytochemicals, and antioxidant activity in selected red morph Amaranthus leafy vegetable","['Red morphs amaranth leaves have abundant antioxidant pigments and phytochemicals such as β-carotene, chlorophyll, vitamin C, β-cyanins, carotenoids, β-xanthins, TAC, betalains, TPC, and TFC. It also has abundant protein, dietary fiber, and minerals such as Ca, K, Mg, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Cu compared to leafy vegetables. Correlation study revealed that natural antioxidant pigments and phytochemicals had strong antioxidant capacity. It could be a potential leafy vegetable as a source of natural antioxidant pigments and phytochemicals having strong antioxidant activity along with nutritional components in our daily diet to combat with the hidden hunger and attaining nutritional and antioxidant sufficiency. Hence, red morphs amaranth with rice, wheat, and maize in our daily diet could contribute to attaining nutritional and antioxidant sufficiency.']"
2015-08-19T00:00:00Z,Metabolomic and Lipidomic Analysis of Serum Samples following Curcuma longa Extract Supplementation in High-Fructose and Saturated Fat Fed Rats,"['A view of the metabolic changes in an animal model fed with high fructose and saturated fatty acid diet, as long as the effects of integration with the nutritional supplement Curcuma longa has been provided by NMR metabolomics and GC-MS lipidomics of the serum. While the observed and expected, diet-induced, metabolic disorders (insulin resistance) could not be countered by the nutritional supplement, elements have been discerned of a possible localized protection, notably at the liver level. Indeed, while perturbation of several energy-related metabolites (amino acids, ketonic bodies, creatine, pyruvate, glucose, VLDL) have been observed in both animals fed with the high fructose and saturated fatty acid diets, despite Curcuma longa dietary supplementation, specific biomarkers could be associated to this latter setup. Particularly, a depression of the alcohol oxidation, detected through an enhanced concentration of methanol, and a possible activation of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, consistent with a reduction of glutamine and glycoprotein levels. Both these two effects point towards a modified liver function. Further biomarkers of the curcuminoid enriched diet were a significant alteration of the concentration of long chain unsaturated fatty acids: C20:5n-3, C22:6n-3 and C24:1n-9. The variation in the concentration in this latter is a specific effect of the nutritional supplement, as it is not observed in the high fructose and saturated fatty acid diet groups, and is suggestive of a cellular enhanced response to the membrane rigidification associated to insulin resistance. All of these points to possible specific and local, rather than systemic, protective effects of Curcuma longa, and further studies are underway to clarify this issue.']"
2015-07-15T00:00:00Z,The Nutrient Balance Concept: A New Quality Metric for Composite Meals and Diets,"['The Nutrient Balance Concept (NBC) represents a new aspect to nutrient profiling. Although based on the nutrient composition of single foods, the NBC was specifically developed to take this a stage further–to be able to assess the overall nutritional quality of meals composed of multiple food items as well as that of total diets.The three distinctive features of the method are novel metrics that:\n\nNumerically describe the content of qualifying and disqualifying nutrients of individual foods in a way that is independent of portion size and which, importantly, acts as a solid basis for developing various algorithms\nAllow the same analytical approach to be used across the entire food spectrum–from simple food components to complex meals and total diets, and\nProvide an original way to judge nutrient complementarity and the overall nutrient quality of meals and diets composed of multiple food items.\nThe application of the NBC algorithm to the online MyPlate 7-Day Sample Menus provides the first objective evaluating of this important nutrition communication plan. The results showed that the overall nutrition quality of the meals developed by the USDA was very high in variety, total nutrient content and relative quantities of individual nutrients (see Figs 3, 4 and A-E in S1 File; Table 4). The nutrition quality of day-to-day food patterns was also very high and remarkably constant over 7 days. The NBC calculations did, nevertheless, show some variation in the values of QI, DI and NB across meals, depending on the specific foods used.Finally, the NBC algorithm, which is relatively simple to create for particular applications and for different computer systems, could become a useful tool for devising diets or fine tuning meal planning, especially those for populations on a strict budget or with special cultural or clinical needs.']"
2016-05-18T00:00:00Z,"Perinatal Exposure to a Diet High in Saturated Fat, Refined Sugar and Cholesterol Affects Behaviour, Growth, and Feed Intake in Weaned Piglets","['In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that foetal or early life exposure to a diet enriched in saturated fat, sucrose and cholesterol has subtle effects on behaviour of (non-obese) piglets, with reduced aggression and increased locomotion, without having apparent adverse effects on anxiety-related behaviours after weaning. The exposure to the HFS diet after birth also induced long-lasting changes in voluntary feed intake, growth and feed efficiency in piglets, which may have resulted from early post-weaning AA restriction. Our study also emphasises the importance of the interactions between in utero and early postnatal nutrition for the behavioural development of the offspring, as some behavioural effects of postnatal exposure to the HFS diet depended on the prenatal dietary history. Further studies are needed to determine which factors, such as maternal and offspring metabolic status, diet composition or digestive enzymatic activity, underlie the equivocal results found between our study and prior research in rodents. Considering the current socio-economic context characterised by the widespread availability of diet high in fat and refined sugars, the characterisation of dietary or metabolic factors underlying the effects of a perinatal high-fat high-sugar high-cholesterol diet on behaviour in pigs could have interesting applications in terms of dietary recommendations for perinatal nutrition in humans.']"
2019-03-15T00:00:00Z,Long-term dietary intervention with low Phe and/or a specific nutrient combination improve certain aspects of brain functioning in phenylketonuria (PKU),"['This study is the first to demonstrate that both a long-term low Phe diet, a diet enriched with SNC as well as both diets combined is able to ameliorate some, but not all of the PKU-induced abnormalities. Both diets seem to improve some, but not other domains that are impaired in the BTBR PKU mouse model. Specifically, this study demonstrates that a long-term intervention study in BTBR PKU mice improves novel object recognition, while a long-term intervention with a low Phe diet nearly normalizes serotonin and norepinephrine levels. Future research should be aimed at developing an optimal nutritional intervention to target brain function in PKU patients.']"
2017-12-12T00:00:00Z,Determinants of dietary diversity and the potential role of men in improving household nutrition in Tanzania,"['Food and nutrition insecurity remains a complex problem, mainly in rural areas in less developed countries such as Tanzania. Our study revealed that the diet among households lacked diversity, and that the intake of foods from animal sources (meat, poultry and offal, fish and seafood) was low, especially among the children and women. Women and children access a less diverse diet, since 46% and 26% achieved minimum dietary diversity respectively. Children under five and women in female-headed households had significantly low dietary diversity scores compared to those in the male-headed households. Vegetable production emerged as an important subsector in improving household dietary diversity, particularly for women. Additionally, gender and education of the household head, training on food and nutrition and size of land owned contribute to improved dietary diversity.Men can contribute towards improving household nutrition security by reducing their consumption of food away from home, particularly during food shortages, and using the money saved to purchase nutritious food for the household. Male farmers also could set aside a part of the produce harvested for household consumption rather than market sale. These actions could potentially reduce any form of malnutrition among children and women. Because most households depend on agriculture, awareness creation should focus on improving the production of vegetables and consumption of foods with superior micronutrient density for improved nutrition. Thus, there is a need to support community-based sensitization programs to provide information on food preparation, human nutrition, and the importance of growing vegetables for household consumption. Such programs should focus on encouraging men to actively participate in providing diversified diet to their households.']"
2019-02-27T00:00:00Z,"Potential impacts of climate-related decline of seafood harvest on nutritional status of coastal First Nations in British Columbia, Canada","['Traditionally-harvested seafood remains fundamental to the contemporary diet of coastal BC FNs and provides substantial levels of essential nutrients. Dietary shifts aggravated by climate-related declines in seafood consumption may have significant nutritional and health implications for BC FNs. It is important to note that the traditional diet of coastal BC FNs has already been declining as a result of social and environmental changes and has led to the inadequate intakes of important nutrients. For example, from the Fraser River to northern BC, eulachon which was formerly a staple for coastal communities, and is known to be an excellent source of vitamin A, has almost disappeared. Similarly, bivalves, an excellent source of protein and iron, has diminished substantively. These major changes account for some of the limited changes in iron and vitamin A seen from the climate change modelling. Therefore, strategies to improve seafood harvest potential and access rights to coastal communities are needed to ensure the nutritional health and overall well-being, and to promote food security and food sovereignty in coastal FNs. In particular, more rigorous adaptations scenarios and a transformation in fisheries governance, involving participatory methodologies to incorporating Indigenous knowledge, livelihood objectives and perspectives, are needed to address the nutritional burden facing FN’s diets.']"
2017-08-22T00:00:00Z,Ecological stoichiometry of the honeybee: Pollen diversity and adequate species composition are needed to mitigate limitations imposed on the growth and development of bees by pollen quality,"['\nThe feeding strategy of a pollen eater contrasts with the strategies of other herbivores due to the exceptional nutritional richness of pollen.\nParticular honeybee castes and sexes differ in stoichiometry and need to incorporate various proportions of elements during development; therefore, different castes and sexes experience different stoichiometric mismatches and must be provided with appropriate and balanced combinations of nutrients in their food.\nThe nutritional elements that limit honeybee development to the highest degree due to their scarcity in pollen are Na, S, Cu, P and K. Zn and N were determined to be possibly limiting for bees.\nNot all plants produce pollen that satisfies the nutritional requirements of bees with respect to the required proportions of elements. Pollen eaters may not be able to stoichiometrically balance their diets without access to pollen species that are rich in limiting elements. Floral diversity may allow all of the necessary nutritional elements to be gathered in the appropriate proportions. Thus, a diverse flora is needed for bee development.\nParticular plant species that satisfy the nutritional requirements of bees may play greater roles than other species in stoichiometrically balancing the diets of pollen eaters. These taxa should be promoted in intervention strategies aimed at improving the nutritional base for pollen eaters, regardless of the amounts of nectar and pollen produced. We propose clover as such a stoichiometrically balanced taxon for bees.\nSingle-species crop plantations might limit bee development even if the crops are rich in nectar and pollen. Sunflower may negatively affect bees’ growth and development because of the scarcity of P in its pollen.\nThere is a need for data that allow the comparison of taxonomic, environmental, and soil nutritional status factors that may influence the elemental composition and stoichiometry of pollen.\n']"
2017-10-23T00:00:00Z,"Successful selection of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) on their ability to grow with a diet completely devoid of fishmeal and fish oil, and correlated changes in nutritional traits","['The results obtained for the third generation rainbow trout selected for their growth on a V diet confirm that selection has successfully improved both the mean body weight and survival of the selected versus control fish fed the V diet. SY-V fish now reach the same final body weight as control fish fed the M diet.In the present study, we were able to attribute the better growth performance of the selected line to a higher feed intake. This result confirms that acceptance of a plant-based diet, one of the major steps impeding the total replacement of marine ingredients, can be improved by selection [26]. The reluctance of fish to eat plant-diets remains poorly understood. Hence, the potential to lower sensitivity to plant-diet components through selection, leading to higher feed intake, requires further investigation. The two lines used in this study are a good models to work on.Aside from feed intake, the selection had a limited effect on other nutritional traits in comparison with the diet effect. But the effect of the selection will increase with generations of selection, while the dietary effect should remain stable. It is therefore essential to carefully monitor its consequences such as the EPA/DHA biosynthesis capacity, but also its consequences on traits which were affected by the selection only when fish were fed the M diet (protein retention and starch digestibility).Finally, the feed intake of the selected line was improved similarly when fish were fed the M or the V diets. Our study did not allow us to identify a specific nutritional trait that was significantly improved when fish were fed the V diet only, which could explain the higher genetic gain recorded for those fish. Other traits such as the immune parameters or the microbiota should also be explored in future generations as they are also known to influence the performance of fish fed a plant-based diet.']"
2016-08-09T00:00:00Z,Environmental Life Cycle Assessment of Diets with Improved Omega-3 Fatty Acid Profiles,"['We analysed the potential of two strategies for improving nutritional and environmental characteristics of French diets: 1) modifying diets by changing the quantities and proportions of foods and 2) increasing omega-3 contents in diets by replacing certain foods with equivalent foods with higher omega-3 contents while maintaining the same quantities and proportions of foods. We assessed environmental impacts of these strategies and investigated options which could further reduce environmental impacts from an LCA perceptive.The Vegetarian diet had lower environmental impacts than the PNNS diet, which had lower environmental impacts than the current Average diet. Increasing omega-3 contents of the diets by including foods higher in omega-3 did not influence the diets’ environmental impacts. Such substitutions, however, can provide healthier diets without increasing environmental impacts or pressure on fish stocks. Animal foods dominated the environmental impacts of waste in the average current diet.']"
2017-04-06T00:00:00Z,Higher fish but lower micronutrient intakes: Temporal changes in fish consumption from capture fisheries and aquaculture in Bangladesh,"['The valuable role of aquaculture in Bangladesh in securing the availability and affordability of fish is unquestionable. If growth in this sector had not occurred, declines in nutrient intakes described here would undoubtedly be much more severe, with far more serious implications for nutrition and health. However, the results presented here highlight unintended negative consequences of policy decisions and agricultural investments which are narrowly focused on maximising production and productivity. In doing so, our results challenge the dominant rhetoric that increases in food supply automatically lead to improvements in diet and nutrition. These findings are of significance to many countries experiencing rapid growth in aquaculture alongside declining quantity and diversity of species from capture fisheries. In this light, whilst the findings are specific to Bangladesh, it is possible that this decline of nutritional quality linked to a shift towards greater farmed fish consumption, is occurring on a global scale. As aquaculture becomes an increasingly important food source for many, it must embrace a nutrition-sensitive approach, by considering how changes in food supply affect nutritional quality of diets. To do so requires greater knowledge of the nutritional value of indigenous foods at species/varietal level, and the contributions these foods make in terms of nutrient intakes and dietary patterns, specific to age and sex groups, as well as to differences in rural/urban locations and geographic regions. Indicators used in the monitoring and evaluation of agricultural interventions must go beyond production and productivity, to also include nutritional quality. If the intrinsically linked issues of poverty, food insecurity and malnutrition are to be truly addressed; and for the SDGs to be achieved, agricultural policies must integrate strategies to mitigate trade-offs across multiple sectors, including (but not limited to) nutrition and health.']"
2013-12-03T00:00:00Z,"Diet-Induced Over-Expression of Flightless-I Protein and Its Relation to Flightlessness in Mediterranean Fruit Fly, Ceratitis capitata","['This study showed effects of nutritional deficiency on over-expression of fli-I and medfly flightlessness. The adult medflies emerged from pupae whose larvae were reared on a fatty acid deficient liquid diet looked normal, but could not fly, whereas the control flies emerged from pupae whose larvae were reared on the standard mill feed diet looked normal and had normal flight ability. The two groups of larvae showed large differential differences of protein profiles. In comparison, fli-I, LRR-containing G protein-coupled receptor 2, LRR protein soc-2 and protein wings apart-like were over-expressed in pupae from larvae fed with the fatty acid deficient liquid diet. The results signify that nutritional deficiency induces fli-I over-expression in medfly. Fli-I over-expression may depress the Wnt signaling, as indicated by under-expression of several Wnt pathway proteins, and thus cause flightlessness. As the fli-I gene is highly conserved across life forms from insects to humans and SMS is due to an abnormality in the short (p) arm of chromosome 17 where fli-I gene is located, we would postulate that nutritional deficiency might be associated with human SMS.']"

Within our Thai cohort we will continue to monitor SSB consumption and links with diabetes, metabolic syndrome and dental health and we will increase the precision of our capture of SSBs; we note the desirability of other longitudinal studies doing the same.

Many health promotion strategies nowadays are drawing attention to the Mediterranean diet and these initiatives need a valid tool to assess the nutritional intakes of a population.The objective of this study was to adapt a 157-item semi-quantitative FFQ already developed and validated on a population of Lebanese pregnant women, to assess its validity and reproducibility among the general adult Lebanese population [14]. The FFQ validated in this study showed good reproducibility and relative validity compared to three 24h DRs in a heterogeneous sample of adults living in a Mediterranean country.In conclusion, we offer a valid FFQ that could be helpful in estimating food groups and nutrient intakes and useful for the investigation of dietary risk factors and Non Communicable Diseases. This FFQ is also suitable for clinical trials including nutritional interventions promoting the Mediterranean diet. Future works could focus on developing and validating a computerized version of this FFQ in order to limit its administration time.']"

However, the presence of sorghum caused a reduction in the digestibility of DM, OM, CP, DE, and ME, and promoted greater fecal production. The fecal score was kept in good standard. There was a darkening of feces and urine of the dogs that received sorghum and HT in the diet, strongly indicating that there is metabolism and excretion of its constituents. The addition of HT reduced DM and water content in feces. Although the expected glycemic response results were not observed, sorghum-containing tannins may replace part of rice in canine diets. It brings some consequences like reducing ME content and digestible protein of the diets and may be used as an ingredient to reduce ME in diets restricted in energy, but the content of digestible protein must be compensated by other ingredients. Hydrolysable tannins seems like to potentialize CT effects, but more studies are needed to define what role HT may play on dogs nutrition.']"

We identified a significant tradeoff between nutrients and toxins in the selection of individual trees at a small-spatial scale and found that available N was the key to understanding the selection of some trees. We argue that taxonomic and phenotypic diversity is likely to be important when foraging in habitats of low nutritional quality providing diet choice to tradeoff nutrients and toxins and minimise movement costs. Our findings support the assertion that immediate nutritional concerns are an important priority of folivores in low-quality habitats and imply that nutritional limitations play an important role in constraining folivore populations.']"

2019-09-26T00:00:00Z,Lipidome profiles of postnatal day 2 vaginal swabs reflect fat composition of gilt’s postnatal diet,"['Vaginal swab lipidomes were significantly affected by composition of early postnatal diet. Multiple lipid molecules were differentially abundant between gilts exposed to colostrum versus gilts fed milk replacer and gilts provided a fat supplement versus no fat supplementation during the first 48 h of life. Several lipids collected from vaginal swabs were highly correlated with the nutrition source a piglet ingested. Lipids more abundant in milk replacer appeared to be driving the association in the current study. These findings demonstrated that lipid composition of neonatal diet affects tissue composition and thus may affect development, function and overall health and fertility. Moreover, while data support the efficacy of using MRM-lipid profiling of vaginal swabs to detect differences in early postnatal nutritional exposures, findings also highlight a need to modify our approach to determine if biomarkers of colostrum intake can be specifically identified in vaginal swab samples.']"

The CSM100 diet had an adverse effect on laying hen performance and egg albumen quality. This study identified 15 proteins involved with various biological functions, including antimicrobial activity, gelling characteristics, immune responses, inhibition of protein precipitation, protease inhibition, and metal ion binding or transport, that may play an important role in albumen quality reduction in the CSM100 group. The decrease in egg white proteins was induced by lower tubular gland and epithelial cell growth of the oviduct magnum when hens were fed a CSM100 diet. This study demonstrated at the molecular level that SBM should not be totally replaced with CSM in the diet of hens.After the experiment, the remaining hens was fed using the control diet in the normal feeding conditions as described in Method part.']"

These changes reflect a poorer quality diet for both sexes, but more so for males, and were accompanied by increases in body weight, BMI, waist to hip ratio and body fat, which could lead to possible longer-term health implications and increased disease risk [50, 51]. Sex-specific changes were evident for nutrition indicating that males’ diets were lower in quality, and body composition changes indicated that males experienced more adverse changes by gaining more body weight, waist circumference and fat mass than females. Future research should focus on mitigating these adverse changes particularly during times of stress through the development of effective sex-specific interventions targeted at improving dietary habits and nutritional knowledge, as well as mitigating adverse body composition changes as students transition into university life.']"
2019-05-09T00:00:00Z,Trans-omics analyses revealed differences in hormonal and nutritional status between wild and cultured female Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica),"['In conclusion, that trans-omics analysis indicated that the ovulation problem, often observed in cultured female eels may be the result of a high-carbohydrate diet and/or a suboptimal DHA/EPA/ARA ratio in their diet. Interactions between nutrition and reproductive performance have been reported in domesticated animals [75–77], and poor reproductive performance has been reported in cultured broodstock compared to wild fish for several fish species [78–80]. The commercial diet for fish is generally designed to promote weight gain and/or fleshing out, regardless of the fecundity of the fish, and an optimized diet for broodstock culture is not commercially available. Future studies should therefore investigate more extensively the effect of diet on the reproductive performance of fish. The findings of the present study suggested several future experimental directions for the improvement of seed production efficiency, including establishing the effects of a high-carbohydrate diet on GH secretion, the effects of impaired GH secretion on the responsiveness to gonadotropins, the effects of lower Shbg levels on oocyte maturation, and the optimal dietary DHA/EPA/ARA ratios. The comprehensive data obtained in this study also demonstrated the usefulness of the omics approaches for understanding the functionality of diet components in aquaculture.']"

Findings of this study justify the need to monitor the nutritional quality of diets, both OH and AH foods and drinks consumption and their implication for student communities’ health and beyond. Overall, there is a strong warrant for further investigation of nutritional studies in order to improve and expand knowledge on determinants of poor dietary choices and food intake.This study provides a first assessment of current dietary habits of the studied population and can be used as baseline data for designing and conducting future studies. More detailed evidence on associations of OH and AH eating and anthropometric outcomes is needed to clearly recognize potential health implications and drivers of malnutrition in the country-specific context. We also showed the need for a coherent body of evidence and tools that are necessary for future nutritional studies of the same nature in Albania, with the final goal of supporting effective, evidence-based interventions that may reduce the impact of malnutrition on public health. A great opportunity exists within the current atmosphere of the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition (2016–2025) to address and advance nutrition narrative and end malnutrition in all its forms in Albania and in the Balkans region.']"

Sheep with a history of late gestation overnutrition, however, were resistant towards such adverse long-term impacts of obesity development during adolescence, since they attained normal metabolic adaptability in adulthood upon normalization of their diet for 2 years. Early obesity development was associated with a complete lack of expansion of PRF but not of other adipose tissues from adolescence to adulthood, resulting in MESF constituting a greater proportion of intra-abdominal fat. Prenatal undernutrition had a similar but much less pronounced effect. This was not associated with adverse metabolic features per se in adulthood, except in individuals with a history of mismatching foetal undernutrition. It may thus be appropriate to consider differential nutritional strategies for individuals born at different extremes of the birth weight spectrum. Both males and females manifest these long-term consequences of pre- and early postnatal nutrition.']"

In the present study, a number of improvements to the eNutri personalised nutrition application’s diet advice were suggested by nutrition professionals including: greater participant profiling (e.g. weight and lifestyle), links to recipes and sources of further information, consideration of additional foods/nutrients of public health relevance (e.g. vitamin D), and more positive message framing/scoring. Future research will assess the efficacy of the system at improving user’s adherence to healthy eating guidance.\nLimitations\nThe eNutri app relies on data from a FFQ, which has some limitations. Identification of specific foods consumed is more limited compared with other methods, such as diet diaries, which may reduce its ability to identify changes in consumption of some foods. In addition, FFQs are not necessarily the nutrition assessment method that NP would utilise during nutrition consultations; 24-hour recall and food diaries are most frequently selected. This study is subjective and qualitative in nature making it more difficult to apply comparative statistics. Furthermore, the food intake on which the eNutri personalised advice was based was translated to food group equivalents by the app, however this information was not provided to the NP. In some cases, this could have contributed to the different dietary targets identified by the eNutri app and the NP. The number of female NP was much higher than male NP, which may be considered as a potential limitation. However this is reflective of the gender distribution of these professions; in the present study 16% of RNutr identified were male and in a recent international survey of RD, 4% of UK respondants were male [2].\n']"

Our results also confirm that the uptake of n3LC in body and testes tissues was directly influenced by the manipulation of PUFAs in the experimental diets. We strongly advocate further experiments that manipulate omega-3/omega-6 ratios (e.g. [116], [117]) and explore the interactive effects of PUFAs with other dietary resources such as carotenoids [109], [118], essential amino acids [119], [120], and vitamin A or E [102], [121].

2020-01-24T00:00:00Z,Best compromise nutritional menus for childhood obesity,"['The multiobjective approach proposed in this paper generates menus that minimize the consumption of substances that are particularly harmful to obese children. It also minimizes the nutritional mismatch and cost of planning to avoid limited access to healthy diets because of economic issues, while complying with the nutritional recommendations of specialized organizations. The proposed model for MO-NMPP-CHO with the created instances was solved with a deterministic method and two metaheuristic methods.Although childhood obesity is a multifactorial problem, the formation of healthy eating habits at an early age creates benefits over the long term. Thus, the multiobjective mathematical programming model for planning nutritional menus described in this paper appears to be an appropriate method to minimize exposure to the major risk factors for the development of chronic diseases associated with childhood obesity, the total cost of nutritional planning, and nutritional mismatch.Nevertheless, the numerical results indicate that solving this type of problem using exact methods is not appropriate to address real or complex instances because of their execution time. Positive results are obtained using evolutionary techniques that require appropriate computational times. Although these techniques only represent an approximate analysis, health professionals can provide guidance to create monthly and weekly plans in a fast and personalized manner, based on the requirements of each child.']"

This relationship persists when sociodemographic, health lifestyle, and maternal factors are taken into consideration. Because ANC is the main source of iron and folic acid supplements and nutrition education during pregnancy, ensuring universal provision of comprehensive ANC, emphasized in India’s Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007–2012) [118], is vital for improving maternal nutrition and health in India. Further epidemiological research in India with large-scale cohorts should focus on uncovering preventable causes of PE or E such as diet and micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy, while public health practice and policy should promote improved access to better food and nutrition and mandatory intake of iron and folic acid supplementation during pregnancy among Indian mothers.']"
2018-09-24T00:00:00Z,Dietary diversity determinants and contribution of fish to maternal and under-five nutritional status in Zambia,"['Wealth status, mother’s educational level and child’s age had an influence on the dietary diversity of children. Fish was the most consumed animal-source food by both women and children and can therefore contribute towards the much-needed nutrients from animal-source foods; especially in children aged 6–59 months. Small fish (Kapenta) is particularly important in the diets of children in poor urban households in Zambia and contributes to better nutritional outcomes. As all small fish stem from capture fisheries, sustainable one health environmental integration, monitoring and management strategies are desirable. Older children aged 24–59 months had a higher prevalence of stunting than those aged 6–23 months. This is attributed to inadequate nutrient adequacy of diets as observed in the low dietary diversity. Furthermore, there are factors that affect stunting that are age-related (e.g. feeding practices and other child care practices). Among the urban poor, both undernutrition, overweight and obesity among children and women are major problems that need a more focused attention by policy makers. The government and development partners should not only channel efforts to solving the stunting problem, but should also implement prevention programmes for overweight/ obesity which is on the increase, especially among children. Utilization of locally produced food in complementary feeding and ensuring that diets are diversified, combined with caring practices, education of mothers and proper sanitary environments are paramount to ensure optimal child nutrition.']"
2018-10-25T00:00:00Z,Xylose metabolism in the pig,"['In conclusion, pigs can metabolize xylose, but with considerably lower efficiency than glucose. Furthermore, pigs can adapt over time to utilize xylose more efficiently, as evidenced by the decline in the portion of dietary xylose excreted in the urine directly or as its metabolites. Xylose retention decreased from 60% to 47% to 41% when pigs were fed diets containing 2, 4, or 8% xylose, respectively. Thus, increasing dietary xylose concentration decreases diet ME. A comprehensive pathway for xylose metabolism in the pig is proposed and D-threitol was confirmed as the major urinary metabolite of xylose. Xylitol, D-xylonic acid, and D-xylulose were identified as minor metabolites.This experiment provides novel data regarding xylose metabolism when fed at relevant concentrations for typical swine diets. To fully understand these data in the context of practical swine nutrition, further research is needed to determine how much free xylose is released from arabinoxylan with xylanase supplementation. Because of the importance and cost of energy in swine diets, assigning an energy release value to xylanase is of great interest. These data indicate that xylose’s energy contribution to the pig will depend on the amount of xylose released and the length of adaptation to the diet.']"
2019-02-21T00:00:00Z,Factors affecting feeding 6–23 months age children according to minimum acceptable diet in Ethiopia: A multilevel analysis of the Ethiopian Demographic Health Survey,"['The proportion of young children aged between 6–23 months receiving minimum acceptable diet was very low (6.1%). This study also showed that this low proportion of minimum acceptable diet among 6–23 months age children is determined by a number of individual and community level factors such as age of the child, mother’s occupation, father’s education level, and media exposure, access of household drinking water and region of residence. Therefore, interventions to improve MAD practice should not only be implemented at the individual level but also be tailored to the community context. Utilizing media to promote feeding young children with minimum acceptable diet through enhancing mother’s knowledge on child feeding practices and advocacy for appropriate complementary feeding, particularly on meeting MAD and nutrition education and social and behavior change interventions should be strengthened targeting the infants and children aged 6–8 months and unemployed mothers.']"
2018-07-31T00:00:00Z,Detection of new pathways involved in the acceptance and the utilisation of a plant-based diet in isogenic lines of rainbow trout fry,"['Isogenic lines constitute a relevant biological material in this study as the reduced variability within each line enhances the statistical power to detect differences among groups. The transcriptomic approach, without a priori hypothesis, allowed us to set up a list of molecular markers which may play a role in the acceptance and utilisation of plant-based diets at an early stage, known as a critical rearing phase [22, 24]. Only analysis on whole fry are feasible at this highly important stage, possibly hiding some effects on specific organs [28] and further analyses will be needed on specific organs to strengthen our findings.Nevertheless, we were able to identify an important number of molecular markers linked to the utilisation of a plant-based diet. Moreover, the comparison of three isogenic lines with two genotypes performing better with plant-based diets (R23h and AB1h) than the third one (A22h) reveals different pathways, showing that there are different possible strategies to optimise utilisation of such diets.Several of these genes had been previously identified in other studies and we confirm their potential role in the utilisation of a plant-based diet (immunity, sulfur-containing AA metabolism). In addition, we found new genes, several of which are linked to sensory perception and appetite regulation. Pathways linked to vision, olfaction and feed intake regulation had previously been mentioned in a transcriptomic analysis that studied the nutritional programming of plant-based diets acceptance in RBT [25]. These convergent data strongly suggest that sensory perception is a key determinant of the acceptance of plant-based diets at an early stage. Studying sensory perception mechanisms and the regulation of feed intake by dietary factors should help improve the formulation of plant-based diets, thus improving performance of fish fed diets devoid of marine ingredients.']"

However, a variety of food groups must be included in one’s diet to achieve adequate levels for the most important micronutrients, and nutrient-dense food groups such as fruit are associated with more micronutrients than less nutrient-dense groups. As some micronutrients showed inadequate intake levels, additional nutritional advice should be provided to avoid adverse effects resulting from personal dislike of certain food groups, and the consumption of beneficial foods (especially vegetables and legumes prepared in ways that are easy to digest) should be promoted as some of these groups, legumes in particular, were only consumed in minimal amounts. In addition, shorter time frames between nutritional advice are more successful than longer periods, such as one year.Food variety with special attention to nutrient-dense foods is especially important in players with low energy intake. Consequently, it might be necessary to use supplements for players with SCI, especially for micronutrients involved in bone health. Nutritional monitoring in Paralympic athletes should be incorporated into the regular routine of their training periods throughout the year so that a short time frame between repeated sessions of receiving nutritional advice can be used to raise their knowledge of the benefits of sports nutrition.']"

The magnitude of anaemia determined in this study (30.9%) is considered as a moderate public health problem according to WHO standards [65]. Up to date, only few countries have conducted surveys on micronutrients status at the national or subnational level, and most of them are focused on limited number of micronutrients [47], [48], [68]. Given the paucity of previous data, our results represent a starting point for future research.To effectively tackle micronutrients deficiencies and anaemia in school-aged children, nutritional programs should be oriented to the local needs. Zinc supplementation trials have clearly demonstrated the positive benefits of improved zinc status in children, including reductions in the incidence of various infectious diseases [26], [36]. There is also enough evidence of the benefits of vitamins A and D supplementation programs in similar contexts [10], [26], [76]. Targeting anaemia is a complex challenge in developing countries, where prevalence of malnutrition and infectious diseases is high, although until date, iron supplementation and nutrition education are the only interventions that seem to be effective against IDA [26].Micronutrient-deficiency control programs have been greatly extended in most African countries [14], although most interventions have been focused on single micronutrients and often lack effectiveness [77]. Diet diversification strategies are far less common, despite of dietary diversity being universally recognized as a key component of nutrition programs [9]. Therefore, major efforts are needed to close critical knowledge gaps, to test and scale-up improved and affordable interventions, and to disseminate evidence to decision makers and stakeholders to fully respond to this key public health problem. This will help to rapidly and sustainably improve the diet diversity and the nutritional status in the study setting, which would have a positive impact on economic growth and development.Findings documented by this study would assist in planning and undertaking regional policy initiatives for diet diversification strategies to streamline recommendations. Monitoring activities should also follow these interventions to better assess their impact on micronutrients deficiencies and anaemia. This will enable the right interventions to be chosen and then, once programs are in place, to have the right indicators to follow-up these activities [11].']"

Its contribution to the Lao diet is limited to a minority of frequent consumers. The availability of insects varies according to season and geographic location, and pattern of consumption differs lightly according to ethnicity. The population is ready to eat insects more frequently if the two problems of seasonal availability and cost are solved. Most of the Lao population harvest their own insects and only a third of them are regular buyers. The sale of insects is a female profession and represents an interesting source of income, although locally seasonal.Developing insect farming habits may contribute to generation of income, particularly among women, increase yearly availability, and help decrease the impact on the environment from extensive harvesting.

Using the criteria of two EU-level nutrient profile models, our study suggests that a sizable share of pre-packaged foods in the categories of breakfast cereals, ready meals, processed meat, processed seafood, and yoghurts, contributes to these excessive intakes in Europe. Consequently, additional improvements to the food supply or consumption habits will be needed to achieve the necessary population diet improvements and meet international goals and targets, such as the voluntary WHO NCD targets [47] and the sustainable development goal 3.4 [48]. Reformulation and restricted marketing of those foods that most contribute the above nutrients to people's (including children's) diets are seen as key measures in the move towards health-promoting food environments. Among others, nutrient profiling helps to provide targets for food product improvement and criteria for checking which products may be deemed suitable for marketing to children. More efforts in monitoring the nutritional composition of the food supply as well as complementary measures, such as fiscal measures, clear nutrition information, marketing restrictions, and public procurement criteria for food can provide additional and strong incentives and a level playing field for producers towards a more healthful food supply overall.""]"
2013-10-14T00:00:00Z,A Preference Based Measure of Complementary Feeding Quality: Application to the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children,"['To date there has been no appropriate index for assessing diet quality during the complementary feeding period in developed countries. In this paper we have described the development of a preference-based index for measuring adherence to infant feeding guidelines. The index provides utility (preference) scores on a generic scale where non-adherence to guidelines \u200a=\u200a0 and perfect adherence \u200a=\u200a1. Such scoring systems have been used in the development of health indices [30]. Here we have attempted to make use of the utility theory in nutritional epidemiology. By converting the dietary intakes into utilities we have a technique where summing the utilities of index components that are measured on different scales is meaningful. The strength of the proposed methodology lies in the axioms used to derive it. This is an improvement from using arbitrary cut offs to derive component scores and assumptions of linearity to combine component scores. Moreover, we have proven geometrically that the method of combining scores using the displaced ideal has advantages over the simple linear averaging. By an axiomatic characterization and empirical verification we have shown that the DI method of combining the scores distinguishes between individuals who achieve midrange scores by scoring consistently across components compared with individuals whose midrange scores reflect adherence at the extremes across components. We feel this is an advantage because a very low score places the individual at greater risk of suboptimal nutrition on that component. Thus, the DI method of combining the scores captures uniformity and balanced behaviour across different nutritional dimensions, unlike the LA method where the exchangeability assumption is forced. The CFI also signals those components in which individuals are adhering and not adhering to guidelines. Currently used diet quality scores contain many subjective choices (e.g. cut-offs). By using a utility approach we provide a data driven method that is reproducible and not subjective in nature. In addition, by providing a scoring range for each component we provide a technique that allows judgement of intakes of foods or nutrients that are both beneficial and detrimental, thus making the transition from beneficial to detrimental more subtle. This is a major advance over the existing cut-off based indices. One of the limitations, as noted in the literature [2], [3], [8], with the diet quality measures is their lack of ability to predict health outcomes. However, in our recent work we showed that CFUI predicts outcomes [31]. In future work, we will examine weighting of CFUI components. To acknowledge, the CFUI is one of the few indices that enable assessment of complementary feeding quality [7], a nutritionally and behaviourally important period. With its methodological advances and demonstrated associations with health and development outcomes in childhood, the CFUI can be used to guide the development and evaluation of early life nutrition promotion activities.']"
2015-04-15T00:00:00Z,Subcutaneous and Segmental Fat Loss with and without Supportive Supplements in Conjunction with a Low-Calorie High Protein Diet in Healthy Women,"['In summary, the addition of a caffeine-containing thermogenic, CLA, multi-vitamin, and protein to a low-calorie, high-protein diet for 3 weeks: 1) reduced body weight 97% more, 2) reduced %Fat according to skinfolds 9 times more, and 3) reduced skinfold thicknesses at five of the seven sites, compared to diet alone. Additionally, since the caloric deficit was similar between the SUP and PLA groups but the fat loss was different, the supplements increased the efficiency (114% vs. 79%) of converting a caloric deficit into fat loss, thereby improving fat loss over diet alone by 35%. Since skinfolds were significantly reduced with supplementation and segmental DXA measurements were unchanged, the data suggest that the supplements were affecting the selective mobilization of fatty acids from subcutaneous fat depots for oxidation over visceral and other fat depots. It is recommended that future directions in research focus on isolating the specific contributions of each supplement to the improvements in body weight and body fat. Athletic, healthy women looking to rapidly reduce body fat with a focus on subcutaneous adipose tissue should consider adding supplements such as a thermogenic, CLA, protein gels/powders, and a multi-vitamin to their nutrition intervention as results may be significantly enhanced over diet alone.']"

2017-05-12T00:00:00Z,The malleable gut microbiome of juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss): Diet-dependent shifts of bacterial community structures,"['The intestinal microbiome is substantially involved in metabolism, and increasing plant protein levels in fish feed are significantly affecting this microbiome. This study has furthermore demonstrated that the intestinal microbiome of Rainbow trout can adapt several times towards a given diet and that the diet-type modulates this adaptation. Thus nutritional programming mechanisms of diets on the bacterial community could not be detected—within the presented experimental setup. Early fry feeding with plant proteins will therefore not positively influence the relation between the intestinal microbiome and plant proteins fed in later life stages. However, early fry feeding with fishmeal (representing the current state of work) will certainly not affect the subsequent replacement with plant proteins as well. The phyla and orders found in this experiment agree very well with bacteria that have been found in previous studies and thus the idea of a trout specific core microbiome on higher taxonomic levels is still valid. However, a comparison of the core microbiome in the present study with data from previous results suggests that on lower taxonomic levels diet has a strong modulating effect. These findings should therefore play a key role in further research about fishmeal substitution by including specific bacterial strains commonly present in the GI tract of trout into digestibility analysis.']"

Animals (Gallus gallus) who consumed the Fe biofortified bean-based diet had less abundance of pathogenic bacteria, with concomitant increases in bacteria that produce short chain fatty acids and have known phenolic catabolic capacity. Collectively, these findings provide evidence that, unlike other nutritional methods of increasing Fe status, Fe biofortification does not appear to increase the pathogenic load in the gut, and they raise the possibility that this strategy can further improve in efficacy and safety as the role of the gut microbiota is explored in additional experimental settings.']"

This result is supported by the relatively low proportion of differentially expressed metabolism-related genes in the intestine and liver transcriptomes of juveniles. The present work largely confirms the results of previous studies performed over a shorter feeding period, especially with regards to changes in the expression of genes involved in the bioconversion of cholesterol and fatty acids. Our study shows that dietary-induced molecular and biochemical changes in lipid metabolism were maintained in the long term. In contrast, for several genes involved in protein catabolism, immunity and fatty acid catabolism we observed a differential regulation that could be related to the different developmental stages and/or to the differences in rearing temperature. We also characterize new molecular actors affected by the nutritional stress induced in the fish intestine by introducing plant ingredients in diets for rainbow trout, especially for genes involved in intestinal motility.

2016-11-22T00:00:00Z,On the Effects of Artificial Feeding on Bee Colony Dynamics: A Mathematical Model,"['This paper has proposed a new model to simulate the influence of artificial feeding on bee colony population dynamics. This model was based on a well-established framework and introduced new elements that allow for analysis of artificial diets, which had not been done before.A differential equation describing variation in artificial food was included in the formula. The preference of the bees for natural food was modeled using a function T(f), which includes a parameter d associated with the palatability of the artificial diet. A generic function μ(⋅) was adopted to account for the lack of natural food due to environmental conditions. A function z(⋅) was used to model the approaches adopted by the beekeeper to introduce artificial diet in the colony. A parameter β was introduced to quantify the quality of the artificial food.The proposed model was shown to be consistent with the previous model when there is no artificial food and the foragers gather food with maximum efficiency. The model assumes that, when there is abundance of natural food, the artificial diet is neglected by the bees, as it has been observed in practice. Simulations have shown that this assumption was implemented correctly. Simulations have shown also that, by introducing artificial diets during harsh times (when there is severe shortage of natural food), the beekeeper can avoid the hive collapse that would have occurred if the bees were left to fend for themselves.Experimental results, involving four different artificial diets, were analyzed to validate the proposed model. The experimental results were divided in training and test sets. The parameter β was tuned using the results from the training sets. A good match was found between the results obtained with the model and the results observed experimentally in the test sets.Future studies could apply the proposed model to other environmental conditions and compare results with new experimental data. Experiments to determine the value of β for new diets could be conducted in the laboratory (feeding bees with the artificial diet) and validated in the field. Furthermore, studies could be carried out to assess whether the value of β can be estimated based on nutritional parameters of the artificial diet. Finally, the approach proposed here to analyze the effects of artificial food could be integrated into other bee colony population models.']"
2018-03-27T00:00:00Z,"4000 years of human dietary evolution in central Germany, from the first farmers to the first elites","['This study of human diet between the early stages of the farming lifestyle and the Early Bronze Age in the MES, based on carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses, is amongst the most comprehensive of its kind. Or results show that human dietary behaviour has changed significantly throughout the study period. A distinct increase in the proportion of animal protein in the human diet can be identified over time, a trend which only the people from the BBC did not follow. The results of the stable isotope analyses are consistent with epidemiological data on caries frequency, which indicate the highest proportions of carbohydrates in the human diet in the EN and the lowest in the EBA [19]. These findings may have been due to an increased consumption of either meat or dairy products. Although meat and dairy consumption cannot be distinguished by means of stable isotope data or caries frequency, molecular-genetic analyses of lactase persistence argue against an increased consumption of fresh milk [9]. However, although approximately 70% of the world population has a lactose intolerance, most of them can tolerate dairy foods or lactose-containing foods without developing symptoms [128]. It therefore comes as no surprise that the use of processed milk, i.e. dairy products, appears to have set in early on in the Neolithic period [99]. Unarguably, there was an increasing stabilisation of the supply of meat and secondary animal products throughout the Neolithic. The data dynamics overall argue against an equal availability of animal-derived protein to all sections of the various populations, which attests to early processes of specialisation, individualisation and hierarchisation. Moreover, population-genetic processes are also reflected in the development of human dietary habits. From the 4th millennium BC onwards, groups moved into the MES from the north, sometimes accompanied by violence [6,29], and fundamental demographic changes took place in the FN with the arrival of CWC groups from the north-eastern steppes and the BBC from south-western Europe [6,7]. This former pastoral steppe component, in particular, may have been responsible for the fact that animal-based foodstuffs reached their highest importance in the FN and EBA. Differences in the consumption of animal-derived products between the sexes resulted in significantly lower δ15N values and less access to animal protein in females. Besides behavioural choices as to what food to consume, numerous other nutritional and gender-specific factors must certainly be taken into account when assessing the subsistence and nutritional balance of individuals. In the future, analysis of single amino acids of nitrogen and the compound-specific carbon isotope analysis of lipids and bone mineral may help providing more detailed and nuanced insight on aspects of human diet, such as protein sources in complex foodwebs, nutritional stress and disease [129–131]. They should become a standard in isotope studies and applied more often and routinely.']"

However, given the stability of the mucosal bacteria over time observed in the current study, relative shifts in mucosal bacteria may play a role in pig performance during periods of reduced and improved growth. Further, early dietary challenge resulted in prolonged alterations in the mucosa bacterial profile but the effect was species specific and more associated with antibiotic inclusion than diet complexity which may have implications for evaluation of nutritional alternatives to in-feed antibiotics. This project is a unique assessment of microbial populations within the context of multi-ingredient (i.e. practical swine) diets and attempts were made to address possible confounding factors and maintain conclusions within the limitations of the study design.']"
2017-09-29T00:00:00Z,Rearing of Mallada basalis (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) on modified artificial diets,"['This study aimed to improve an artificial diet based on that formulated by Ye et al. [19] for mass rearing the economically important chrysopid predator M. basalis. When evaluating an artificial diet for the rearing of arthropod natural enemies, it is important to consider development and reproduction of the predator species [25]. In this study, we evaluated the suitability of the artificial diets with respect to development, survival, longevity, and reproductive performance of M. basalis. Nutritional imbalances within a diet may be expressed only in subsequent generations [26]; therefore, the development and reproductive performance of M. basalis fed AD1 and AD2 was assessed over two generations, F1 and F2. We found that M. basalis was able to develop and reproduce when fed artificial diets AD1 and AD2. However, the F1 adult longevity and F2 oviposition period in the AD1 treatment was significantly longer than that in the AD2 treatment. The F1 female proportion, F1 daily oviposition, F1 female oviposition, F2 daily oviposition, and F2 female oviposition from AD1 was significantly larger, while the F1 emergence rate, F2 pupation rate, and F3 egg hatching rate from AD1 was significantly greater compared with those from AD2. These results suggested that AD1 was superior to AD2 in supporting development and reproduction. As for M. basalis fed AD2, the duration of F2 2nd and 3rd larvae were significantly longer than for F1. The F2 oviposition period was significantly shorter than that of F1, and the F2 female oviposition was significantly less than that of F1. These results indicated that the offspring of M. basalis fed AD2 were less thrifty. Only diet AD1 contained sucrose and Vitamin C, which suggests that these ingredients may be important nutrient sources leading to the superiority of AD1. The nutrient balance was considered to be more important than the actual amount [22].The duration of larval developmental of M. basalis reared on AD1 was longer than that previously found when reared on C. cephalonica eggs [20], but was similar to the period when reared on other natural prey species such as Icerya aegyptiaca, Ferrisia virgata and Planococcus citri [6, 20]. The pupal duration of M. basalis reared on AD1 was similar to that of M. basalis reared on C. cephalonica eggs, but was longer than of those reared on I. aegyptiaca, F. virgata and P. citri. The adult longevity of M. basalis reared on AD1 was longer than of that reared on C. cephalonica eggs, I. aegyptiaca, F. virgata or P. citri. The emergence rate of M. basalis fed AD1 was greater than that fed on C. cephalonica eggs, I. aegyptiaca, F. virgata or P. citri. The female proportion of M. basalis fed AD1 was greater than those recorded on I. aegyptiaca, F. virgata, and P. citri, but was similar to that recorded on C. cephalonica eggs. M. basalis fed on AD1 produced more eggs than when fed on the four natural prey species above [6, 20]. However, female M. basalis had lower fecundity in the present study compared with those of C. septempunctata fed on an artificial diet containing pork, liver, whole hen’s eggs, brown sugar, vitamins, and preservatives [27]. This may be explained by different levels of fecundity for different species, or perhaps the nutritional quality of the immature and adult diets of C. septempunctata are superior to our M. basalis diets. Pork, liver, whole hen’s eggs, brown sugar, and vitamins are important nutrient sources. The increased fecundity could also be attributed to a higher conversion efficiency.The developmental duration of F1 immature M. basalis reared on AD1 was longer than that reared on an artificial diet consisting of the same ingredients but with no seawater spirulina [19]. A high content of the dietary alga is suggested to support good larval growth and reduce developmental time [22]. Perhaps the spirulina content in the current study was not high enough. However, the F1 oviposition period and female longevity of M. basalis in the AD1 treatment was longer in the present study compared with that fed the artificial diet described above [19]. The daily oviposition and female oviposition of F1 from AD1 was larger, while the F2 egg hatching rate from AD1 was greater compared with that from the artificial diet excluding seawater spirulina [19]. The spiral-alga powder was added as a dietary protein source because of its high protein content [22].M. basalis was successfully reared on a microcapsulated artificial diet [24]. The fecundity and longevity of M. basalis in the AD1 treatment was similar to that when reared on an artificial diet consisting of beer yeast, hydrolyzed yeast, casein protein, propionic acid, honey, bee larvae, sucrose, and egg yolk [24]. The hatchability from AD1 was lower than that from the diet of Lee [24], however, the bee larvae in the diet of Lee is not readily available, resulting in poor reliability for the continuous production of the artificial diet.In summary, the artificial diet AD1 supported development and reproduction of M. basalis better than the diet formulated by Ye et al. [19] for the mass rearing of this economically important biological control agent. The effect of the quality of AD1 on the long-term rearing of predatory lacewings needs to be further explored as this is a key factor affecting the growth, development, and reproduction of M. basalis.']"

Among these 30 potentially interesting miRNA, members of clusters and similar families were found. Five of them have already been reported as being affected by nutrition in other species and tissues. By investigating the genes they might target, some nutriregulated miRNA appear to be good candidates for further studies in mammary gland biology. For example, miR-494-3p, located in QTL associated with milk fat in cows, may be preponderant for milk lipid synthesis, notably through the regulation of PTEN, and in targeting mTOR, miR-99a-5p may regulate milk protein synthesis. The links between miRNA and DEG previously identified by transcriptomic assays show that 19 DEG may be targeted by nutriregulated miRNA. These observations highlighted two miRNA, miR-204-5p and miR-223-3p, whose expression was the most markedly affected by food deprivation and which may target several DEG, suggesting important roles for both miRNA in the nutritional regulation of gene expression in the mammary gland. Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to support our results and to decipher the function of these miRNA in mammary epithelial cells.MiRNA offer new insights to understand the impact of nutrition on the mammary gland and may help to clarify mammary gene regulation in order to modulate milk quality via nutrition. The nutrition model of food deprivation used in this study was a large challenge, so further studies should be performed with a diet that could be applied by livestock farmers in order to identify the nutriregulation of miRNA under breeding conditions.']"

2018-08-08T00:00:00Z,Understanding selective predation: Are energy and nutrients important?,"['Investigation into the nutritional and energetic content of prey can provide valuable insight into the foraging decisions of predators and help to elucidate whether energy or nutrient-specific foraging is prioritized. Here, however, we found that lycosids contain no more energy or nutrients than do other potentially available arthropod prey, and hence that nutritional factors alone are unlikely to explain why S. youngsoni preys selectively on lycosids. It may be that alternative factors are more influential in shaping this selectivity. For instance, lycosids may have lower capture and handling times compared to other prey. However, as discussed previously, this is unlikely and selectivity is probably driven by factors in the environment of S. youngsoni. For example, selective depredation of lycosids may arise simply as a consequence of high encounter rates if S. youngsoni and lycosids occupy similar microhabitats and are active at similar times. By quantifying the spatial and temporal activity patterns, as well as diets of both groups of predator, the extent of resource overlap could be identified and alternative explanations for the observed pattern of selective depredation evaluated.']"

Their diets were predominantly based on a high consumption of cereals, beans, eggs and processed foods and a low consumption of fruits, vegetables and dairy products, which is in line with results from other national surveys conducted in the general population of El Salvador. These results could be reflecting the nutritional transition El Salvador is experiencing.Institutionalized children were more likely to adhere to a healthy dietary pattern whereas children in poverty were more likely to have less varied and healthy diets.The stunting prevalence was higher than what is estimated for the non HIV infected population from El Salvador, but no other marked differences in terms of weight for height indicators or dietary patterns were observed. However, as HIV infected children and adolescents are at higher risk of developing metabolic alterations, we highlight the need to assess their dietary practices in different context in order to advocate for interventions promoting a healthy life style as a complement to their pharmacological therapy.']"

This includes the Epsilonproteobacteria (Sulfurovum related spp., Arcobacter spp. and Sulfurimonas spp.), which form the thiotrophic microbial mats at Md. 12. Additionally, our analyses showed that other hydrocarbon degrading- and sulfate-reducing microbes as well as seep macro- and/or megafauna contribute to the nutrition of the crab. The stable carbon isotope- and lipid composition of the crab tissue confirmed that it is an opportunistic scavenger, using both, chemosynthetically as well as photosynthetically derived carbon in its diet. This agrees well with the shape of the crab's feeding appendages, which are functionally similar to other lithodid deep-sea crabs with an omnivorous diet (including detritus) and an opportunistic and vagrant life style. The results of this study suggest that cold seeps may have an important ecological role not only for seep-endemic but also for opportunistic, mobile megafauna.""]"
2016-08-10T00:00:00Z,The Great Irish Famine: Identifying Starvation in the Tissues of Victims Using Stable Isotope Analysis of Bone and Incremental Dentine Collagen,"['This study is the first to use the stable isotope analysis of nitrogen and carbon in human dentine to identify changes related to a well-documented historical period of famine. These data are a poignant reminder of the extreme conditions suffered by the children buried at Kilkenny, but also clearly demonstrate that the intervention provided by the introduction of maize allowed many to recover: their nitrogen isotope ratios return to dietary rather than stress levels, and they survived beyond the dietary change. The ability of the human body to adapt to nutritional deprivation and survive, returning to homeostasis, is clear within these profiles.Although the change in diet from a C3 to a C4-based diet is recorded in the isotope ratios of the adult rib bone collagen, it is difficult to resolve the age at which this occurred because of averaging as a result of bone turnover. Using evidence from the dentine collagen δ13C and δ15N profiles and the historical records for both the importation of maize and the timing of cemetery closure we have been able to identify more precisely when in their lifetime the children from this study who died during the Famine period received relief food. The raised δ15N and lower δ13C (famine pattern of opposing covariance) in the dentine profiles of the children is marked by the return to lower δ15N values and higher δ13C in the maize pattern of opposing covariance. Short-term δ13C and δ15N changes in dentine resulting from physiological, in this case specifically nutritional, stress has not previously been demonstrated in an historical population where the records of the period of famine can be related to individuals who suffered. Further work needs to be undertaken to refine the ageing of each increment, both chronological age and the period of time represented, and whether partially mineralised teeth need ageing differently to complete ones. Nonetheless, this study shows that using incremental dentine collagen δ13C and δ15N analysis it is possible to identify periods of physiological stress such as famine in both adult and juvenile skeletons if it occurred during tooth development, i.e. up to approximately 23 years of age. This could have important forensic and archaeological applications for the identification of populations and individuals for whom nutritional stress may have contributed to their death.']"

We found nutritional stress, as indexed by low T3 levels, was greatest at high latitude where habitat quality and lichen abundance was low. Given evidence that Western Arctic Herd caribou that overwinter north of their traditional wintering grounds have lower survivorship (Joly, unpublished data), we put forth the hypothesis that relative importance of lichens in the diet of overwintering caribou is related more to adult survivorship than pregnancy and parturition in our study area. This could manifest itself through better body condition to evade predators. Aside from evidence that caribou wintering north of the herd’s core winter range fare poorer, we did not detect robust, widespread indications of winter time malnutrition. Low winter food availability during late gestation could lead to lower neonatal survival [27] and thus recruitment, which has been detected for the Western Arctic Herd [30]. Suboptimal summer range conditions may lead to depressed milk output, less robust calves, less cows being pregnant and lower survival rates. We found slightly lower than expected pregnancy rates and concurrent with high levels of adult cow mortality during summer (June, July, August; Joly, unpublished data). Additionally, poor recruitment of calves has been documented [30]. Reduced reproductive output and recruitment in concert with lower adult survival rates could be facilitating the herd’s decline and should be investigated further before additional development occurs.']"

Interestingly, for histone H3 two different isoforms were separated on the immunoblots, which could correspond to H3.1 and H3.2 isoforms previously found in terrestrial animals.Concerning gene expression, butyrate applied as a nutritional supplement caused significant changes in vivo in the expression of genes related to epigenetic regulatory mechanisms such as hdac11, ehmt2, and dicer1. Statistical analysis by two-way ANOVA for these genes showed significant differences due to the butyrate treatment (P = 0.002) and to the interaction between tissue and treatment (P = 0.010). The expression of four (il1 β, il8, irf1, and tnfα) out of seven target genes related to mucosal protection and inflammatory response was significantly different between the two analyzed tissues but only for the il10 gene were differences observed in the expression (P = 0.003) due to the butyrate treatment. Thus, in this study we reveal some of the effects of butyrate supplementation. This information is essential for the development of substitution diets in the efforts to improve the sustainability of the aquaculture of carnivorous species.']"
2018-06-19T00:00:00Z,Factors influencing eating behavior and dietary intake among resident students in a public university in Bangladesh: A qualitative study,"['This study was designed to explore the factors that influence eating behaviors and the consumption of food among the resident students at a Bangladeshi university. It suggests that a broad range of factors (intrapersonal, interpersonal, and environmental) play a vital role in developing eating behaviors and food consumption. Intrapersonal factors such as cooking skills, taste preference, family eating habits, and level of nutrition related knowledge and perceptions impacted the development of eating patterns. Along with these individual aspects, societal and environmental factors including campus culture, lifestyle, peer influence, academic activities, and food prices and availability were found to be influential in determining eating habits. The study also suggests that the knowledge regarding nutrition is poor among the resident graduates. However, campus life should possibly provide the students with crucial opportunities to develop healthy eating habits and adopt a balanced diet which form a strong basis for good health throughout life. Therefore, interventions need to consider individual, societal, environmental, and contextual factors in order to aim at increasing healthy eating behaviors and improving the dietary intake of university students.']"

The study shows that Vihiga County is very rich in agrobiodiversity. However, this rich diversity is diminishing due to reliance on a few species by many farmers leaving many other–nutritious—species underutilized. Despite the rich diversity, the diets are low in diversity and micronutrient content with very limited consumption of animal source foods. Policy makers and program implementers aiming to improve diets of communities living in rural areas should aim at promotion of utilization of agrobiodiversity innovatively. For example, integrating local, neglected and underutilized plant species in home gardening and promoting their access through community actions such as biodiversity fairs, diversity kits and establishing community-based home garden resource centers and use of community platforms such as breastfeeding mothers’ clubs and merry-go rounds to promote local agrobiodiversity. Other avenues of promotion of the underutilized nutritious species can be through schools either through learning plots or through school meals programs.']"

Anaemia prevalence was higher among rural residents than urban residents. The study findings indicate that dietary diversity score, gestational age and maternal age are independent determinants of anaemia among pregnant women. Anaemia prevalence was higher with reduced dietary diversity score, reduced maternal age and increased gestational age. Because dietary diversity is an important tool for improving diet quality and also reduce anaemia risk, it will be necessary for appropriate measures such as nutrition education to be put in place to equip individuals especially pregnant women resident in rural areas make right healthy food choices.']"
2019-07-22T00:00:00Z,A critique of the objective function utilized in calculating the Thrifty Food Plan,"['The Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) is the principal policy lever behind the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), a federal food aid program administered under the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) that affects 42 million Americans. Despite its importance, it has received surprisingly little attention from academics. The TFP is a quadratic programming problem containing an objective function that determines an allocation by seeking to minimize the purchase-weighted difference between the logarithmic transformation of a given allocation and actual consumption subject to constraints that ensure adequate caloric and nutritional intake, a federally-mandated budget, and consumption of the USDA mandated “pyramid” [10]. There is also a budget constraint.The purpose of this research is to demonstrate that several alternative formulations to the USDA’s TFP model are theoretically and computationally more straightforward, are easier to interpret, have improved goodness-of-fit to current consumption, and feature allocations that are not substantially sparser than the current model (1). In particular, models (2), (3), and (4) provide better fit to current consumption than the USDA model (1) for all sex/age groups examined. Models (3) and (4) are often no more sparse than model (1), with Gini Coefficients that usually are less than or equal to that of model (1).If the main objective is to find a nutritious diet that is closest to actual/current consumption patterns, model (3) is most commonly superior across all age/sex groups with the best goodness-of-fit overall. Yet there are a few exceptions, namely coffee, which has relatively low allocations in model (3) compared to actual consumption and the other model solutions. However, if the main objective is to find a well-rounded (i.e. least sparse) diet that is also closest to current consumption patterns, all models have less sparsity than the USDA model, and model (4) generally has the least sparsity.In closing, we caution that while our modeling results show the value of alternative approaches to calculating the TFP (and thus for examining the cost of existing diets), these results should not be mistaken for proposals of dietary change in a population. There is no objective criteria to determine what would be acceptable as an optimal dietary change for a population.']"

This study examined the potential for an organic, forage-based diet, including winter wheat and winter rye grazed for 7 weeks in the spring, to supply adequate nutrition for marketable meat quality of dairy steers. Increased forage in the rations of dairy cattle has been reported to improve the FA profile of dairy and beef products. In our study, the FAs from crossbred steers consisted of a greater n-3 FA concentration compared to purebred HOL steers. Furthermore, a lower n-6/3 FA ratio was found in crossbred compared to HOL steers. In sensory evaluation panels, consumers liked steak from crossbred steers more than HOL steaks, and steak from steers grazed on WW over WR. Steak from crossbred steers rated higher than HOL steaks in overall, flavor, and texture likeness. Toughness and juiciness intensities were rated lower and higher, respectively, for crossbred over HOL steaks. Improvements in the nutritional quality of beef may have the potential to improve consumer acceptability of beef and human health.']"

However, cecal parameters showed more intense fermentation of pectin and potato protein, than cellulose and casein, respectively. Higher dietary protein levels also exhibited a stimulatory effect on cecal parameters. Concentrations of SCFA were affected by interactions among experimental variables, suggestive of the modifying effects of nutritional factors on the fermentation process and possibly, on bacterial populations in the gut. Different types of protein affected the concentration of metabolites in large intestinal compartments differently. Feeding potato protein reduced phenol concentrations in the cecal digesta, but increased both the cecal pool of p-cresol, and the concentration of ammonia in the colon. Our observations on colonocyte DNA damage may suggest the beneficial influence of a protein level of 20% in the diet of rats. Moreover, experimental factors influenced large intestine health by its effects on cecal digesta weight, which directly or indirectly determines the production of fermentation end-products, morphological parameters, and DNA status in colonocytes. Nutritional factors increasing the cecal digesta weight contribute to smaller concentrations of phenol (potato protein) and less DNA damage (higher protein level), but may be undesirable because of increased levels of ammonia in the colon (potato protein and pectin). Owing to the differences in the action of experimental factors on particular indices, our results obtained using the rat model require further evaluation, and remain to be confirmed in human studies before the translations in nutritional recommendations to improve the health status of the large intestine.']"

Given the narrow margin between Se deficiency, adequacy, over-nutrition and toxicity, accurately determining this cutoff point is clinically important. People with an adequate or high Se status have already received the maximum benefit from Se and need not take additional Se supplementation, because of the potential risks, such as the increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Ultimately, this study aims to add to our present knowledge about the optimal constitution of an ideal diet to reduce insulin resistance and risk of type 2 diabetes in terms of specific macronutrient and micronutrient composition.']"
2013-12-04T00:00:00Z,Bacterial Endosymbiosis in a Chordate Host: Long-Term Co-Evolution and Conservation of Secondary Metabolism,"['While the progress of genome decay in intracellular symbionts is most well studied in insects, our results show that such phenomena are not limited to this group of hosts. Insect symbionts most often provide nutritional support by synthesizing essential nutrients not found in the insect’s diet, and are sometimes found to be protective against parasites or infection [1]–[3]. The symbiotic relationship of Ca. E. faulkneri and L. patella is instead based on the production of relatively large natural products, and our analysis suggests that these products have been important enough to be conserved against a drive of genome reduction for millions of years. Evidence of such a stable symbiotic relationship cements the role of symbiotic bacteria in natural product production [61], [62], and suggests that intracellular symbionts may be an important source of natural products.']"

The knowledge of the BSF nutrient spectra and in particular, the bioavailability of protein, fats, AAs, FAs, vitamins and minerals, mainly the variation in different life cycle stages, is presently sparse. It was noted that the DM of individual BSFL was increases by about 4000 folds during 14 to 16 days of development. The CP and CF absolute content increased rapidly and reached the highest level in the E-prepupa. Therefore mature larvae and E-prepupa are the life cycle stages for generation of BSF meal.It is the first systematic attempt to examine the nutrient components in BSF, presenting the fluctuation trend of nutritional components in almost every stage of its lifespan from egg to adult. Especially the metabolic patterns over time for development of protein and fats, two of the most important nutrients, were preliminarily revealed. To further validate this metabolic rule, future studies can be extended to explore and evaluate nutritional components of BSF fed on different waste materials during its various life stages. Findings in this study can promote better usage and provide basis for further exploring of developmental and metabolic biology of this resource insect.']"
2018-02-06T00:00:00Z,Effect of maternal height on caesarean section and neonatal mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa: An analysis of 34 national datasets,"['Our study findings show that short stature is associated with adverse reproductive outcomes. Short maternal stature leads to more caesarean sections, and shorter women experience higher levels of neonatal loss. While caesarean sections can be lifesaving operations, they cost the health system and families more, and are associated with worse health outcomes.The problems of short stature can be potentially mitigated by better intrapartum care, but are best addressed through nutrition and infection prevention outside the childbirth period. Our findings contribute to highlighting the importance of implementing policies and programmes promoting good health and nutrition of young girls and women throughout the life course. Adult height is primarily established by averting stunting during the first two years of a child’s life, i.e. the critical first 1000 days [4], but recent research has shown that some catch-up growth might occur in adolescence and early adulthood[26]. Policies should target improved infant nutrition and reduced infections in infancy, with the aim of increasing girls’ adult height and thus reducing future adverse birth outcomes, and targeting healthy diets for older children, adolescents and young adults to promote potential catch-up growth. About a fifth of stunting could be reduced in high burden countries with an annual investment of $9.6 billion to scale up ten evidence-based nutrition interventions [44], although all available interventions for nutrition and disease prevention are estimated to be able to avert only about a third of stunting in total in the 1000-day window [45]. Additional evidence suggests that addressing the intergenerational effects of undernutrition [45–47] are essential to reducing stunting, and underscores the importance of a life course approach to targeting high impact nutrition interventions on children, girls, and in pregnancy. Making gains in the adult height of females is also important since short maternal stature is associated with small-for-gestational-age births, which has in turn been linked to increased risk of neonatal and infant mortality, as well as long-term health consequences such as neurocognitive impairment and adult chronic disease [40, 48–51]. Policies targeting stunting in infant girls, that aim to increase their adult height and thus decrease their subsequent risk of experiencing caesarean section, adverse birth outcomes, and other aspects of poor child and adult health should be strongly supported.']"

The dietary pattern characterized by frequent pizza and pasta consumption (>2 times per week) was associated with a higher lycopene intake and higher lycopene plasma concentration, but it was also high in energy, SFA, trans-FA and sodium intakes. Thus, a diet with a frequent pizza and pasta intake presents a nutrient profile inconsistent with dietary recommendations that aim to reduce chronic disease risk in middle-aged and older adults at high risk of chronic diseases living in the Southeastern USA. Future studies of lycopene as a protective dietary factor against chronic disease should consider the overall nutritional quality of lycopene-containing foods.']"

Also, nutritional habits and hydration of cavers were assessed, revealing interesting details that will be useful in defining an ideal diet for this special type of physical activity that requires a protracted, although moderately intense, exercise under singular environmental conditions. Since the scientific literature on caving is scarce, its distinguishing characteristics call for more research to better determine the physiological basis of this activity in a variety of settings and for multiple purposes. From a methodological point of view, we have shown the usefulness and suitability of bioimpedance vector analysis to evaluate body composition variations in subjects performing physical activity in extreme environments, such as those related to cave exploration.']"

Nutrition education for disease prevention should promote bean consumption as part of a healthy lifestyle that fits with cultural traditions among Latino groups. Promotion of cultural practices may make recommendations more salient and achievable for immigrants, especially those with limited resources. Culturally appropriate health messages are essential and cannot be derived from national survey data alone.

During the cheliped regeneration process, crabs could accelerate bud growth by increasing the crude protein content, promote regeneration rate and shorten molting cycle by up-regulating the positive growth-related gene and down-regulating the molting inhibition gene, and accelerate nutrient metabolism such as lipid metabolism and tryptophan metabolism. Our study found that the molting of crabs in the autotomy group was earlier than in control group. In order to promote the cheliped regeneration and molting, we recommend that we should enhance the hepatopancreas total lipid content, strengthen the nutrition of fatty acids such as MUFA and DHA and supply appropriate amounts of L-tryptophan to the diet, which will help to promote cheliped regeneration and improve survival rate after molting.']"

2017-11-09T00:00:00Z,Challenges and opportunities for Moringa growers in southern Ethiopia and Kenya,"['Ethiopia and Kenya are among the countries where hidden hunger is widespread. The survey reported here has generated useful information on human dietary usage and other common uses of MO and MS by communities in southern Ethiopia and Kenya. The participating MGH include subsistence farmers, most likely to be affected by hidden hunger and thus benefit from a perennial, drought resilient food plant. Where Moringa growers in these countries use MO or MS edible parts in their diet, this is likely to contribute to better mineral nutrition of the consumers. There are differences between regions in how Moringa is typically used, and which parts of the plant are consumed in meals, suggesting opportunities exist to learn more from these varying uses, which could influence any extension work. This could also help to understand why some MGH in Kenya choose not to eat Moringa.We found a high level of awareness of multiple roles of Moringa among MGHs, although as with diets, these reported uses varied between regions. The presence of MGHs with Moringa saplings of one year or less indicates that the cultivation of Moringa is expanding. We have also documented some of the potential barriers to further widening use of these species, according to current growers. These particularly relate to: increasing evidence as to the benefits of Moringa products; pest/disease control; and, access to secure markets.The perennial nature, multiple uses, and resilience to drought of Moringa species make them a suitable target for more agro-silvicultural, nutritional, and pharmacological research. A comprehensive, integrated and multidisciplinary research effort, and links with development and extension agents are required on these multipurpose tree species to develop them not only as crops to contribute to the alleviation of hidden hunger, but to potentially develop a commodity crop that can improve some of the multifaceted socioeconomic problems in tropical and subtropical developing countries. Although the multiple uses and services that can be derived from Moringa spp. are opportunities, maximization of the potential benefits requires research, extension and developmental priority setting in consultation with the stakeholders to better understand their viability.']"
2013-01-30T00:00:00Z,A Pilot Study Assessing the Impact of a Fortified Supplementary Food on the Health and Well-Being of Crèche Children and Adult TB Patients in South Africa,"[""It should be noted that this population's subsistence diet consists primarily of foods which are fortified according to government guidelines [29]; yet very low micronutrient levels were found at baseline.Despite the short period of intervention, there were statistically significant improvements in key micronutrient levels, well-being and energy, hand-grip strength, the BIA Illness Marker, and certain clinical indicators.BMI and MUAC are frequently used as standard measures to evaluate the efficacy of nutritional interventions. However, weight gain does not necessarily indicate improved nutritional status. Hand-grip strength, lean body mass and the BIA Illness Marker appear promising indicators of nutritional state as they were more sensitive to change over time and they reflect functional change.The research indicated a beneficial effect of e’Pap for both study populations, and particularly for adult TB patients, whose baseline data reflected severe food insecurity and malnutrition in a majority of cases.Poor food security and dietary diversity undermine health and are likely to undermine conventional TB treatment and early childhood development. The improvement in serum micronutrient levels over the short time period of this study suggest that fortified supplementary foods, such as e’Pap, with bio-available micronutrients could be of great benefit, particularly if incorporated into health interventions in resource poor settings.Though suggestive, this study’s limitations prevent firm conclusions. Wider investigation with a larger sample size, increased duration of intervention and longer term follow-up to ascertain the sustainability of the positive outcomes is recommended. A detailed and more resource-intensive follow up study could inform public health interventions aimed at addressing micro-nutrient deficiency and improving the efficacy of conventional treatment protocols.""]"
2019-06-12T00:00:00Z,Determining factors for the prevalence of anemia in women of reproductive age in Nepal: Evidence from recent national survey data,"['This study demonstrates the factors associated with the prevalence of anemia in Nepal. It is quite evident from the study findings that the general health status of the women of reproductive age in Nepal needs substantial improvement. This study found that about 41% of the women of reproductive age was anemic. Thus, anemia could be considered as a severe public health problem. The higher prevalence of anemia revealed in this study compared to the past survey highlights the needs to reconsider the existing nutritional policy in Nepal. The prevalence of anemia was higher among underweight women, while obese women were less likely to become anemic. Both, anemia and lower BMI are the indicators of poor nutritional status. Poor diet quality may result in the lower bioavailability of dietary iron, thus increasing the risk of developing anemia. An overall higher prevalence of anemia suggests the necessity of developing appropriate nutrition interventions; iron supplementation could be the immediate measure to cure anemia while periodic deworming, food diversification, and food fortification might be the long-term measures for the management of anemia. Given that a larger proportion of households are using well-water as the source of drinking water, appropriate measures to protect the well-water such as protecting the wells and disinfection of water before use may decrease the likelihood of parasite infestation, and in turn, reduce the prevalence of anemia. Mobilization of community health workers and volunteers can be a strategic measure to reach a large section of adolescents including women of reproductive age. Anemia surveillance and interventions programs specific to targeted groups and high-risk populations are recommended for reduction of anemia.

The increased expression of Cnr1 in the hypothalamus and PAT of PC female offspring suggest a hyposensitization of the cannabinoid activity, which may result in a reduction in chocolate preference, leptinemia and body weight at adulthood. However, the decreased expression of Pparγ and the eCBs-degrading enzymes Faah and Mgll in the liver of PC females suggest a hypersensitization of the PPARγ/cannabinoid receptor activity (Cnr1 showed a tendency to decrease), which may result in an alteration of fatty acid uptake, cholesterol profile and hepatic transaminases. The decreased expression of the NAEs-degrading enzyme Faah and the AGs-synthesizing enzyme Daglβ in the PAT of PC males suggest an increase in the AEA tone and a decrease in the 2-AG tone, which may finally result in an increase in de novo lipogenesis (Acaca) in PAT and a decrease in the lipid uptake (Pparγ) in the liver, as well as perirenal adiposity and leptinemia. These outcomes are independent of the postnatal diet. These results emphasize the importance of nutritional conditions during these critical windows in the development of the abnormal phenotype exhibited by offspring in a sex-dependent manner. Therefore, we propose that the perinatal exposure to a highly palatable food could program the energy metabolism and feeding behavior by different mechanisms that include the affectation of the ECS. Whether the dysregulation found in the ECS could increase the vulnerability for developing diseases in presence of deleterious dietetic or hormone conditions must be addressed in future studies.']"
2013-12-10T00:00:00Z,Site Distribution at the Edge of the Palaeolithic World: A Nutritional Niche Approach,"['Based on our analysis of multi-disciplinary data we propose that the distribution of the richest Lower to Middle Palaeolithic archaeological sites in this part of northwest Europe is a real behavioural distribution reflecting hominin activity patterns rather than a taphonomic distribution. During the last four interglacials the location of the richest Palaeolithic sites in terms of biface densities is strongly biased to the lower reaches of river valleys and sites which were above NTL but in proximity to tidal rivers and estuaries. This may also have been the case earlier, as suggested by marine molluscs, barnacles and foramnifera at sites such as Pakefield and Happisburgh III [3] but analysis is prevented by the small number of sites and is complicated by the breaching of the Weald-Artois anticline creating the Straits of Dover and by major changes in fluvial geography [120], [28]. There are several reasons why lower reach of river valley floors would have been a favoured habitat in north west Europe including access to water, safety from predators, lowest river crossing points (natural rivers are shallow and frequently anastomose in these reaches facilitating crossing) and food resources. In this paper we have used a database of plant and animals resources known from Pleistocene sites in the region to compile a potential list of nutritional resources. Through ecological classification the nutrient landscape can be estimated and this shows a marked potential locational advantage for floodplain zones as opposed to the forested slopes, plateaus and even clearings. It is argued that this advantage may have included access to plants and animals which provided both essential energy and macronutrients but also critical micronutrients which maintained population health and maximised reproductive success and may have increased cultural complexity [121]. Such Palaeolithic diets with an aquatic component have been implicated in ‘healthy aging’, an emerging concept in evolutionary nutrition which has as its mantra ‘we are what we eat, but we should be what we ate’ [122], [87]. It is possible these locations were perceived as ‘healthy/good places’ to which hominins returned on a regular, and prolonged basis, and may have been ‘marked’ by their assemblage of artefacts [123]. If these were important and revisited locations they provide nodal points in the Palaeolithic geography of north west Europe and support the contention that river valleys provided the nutrient-rich route-ways of exploration and utilization of Palaeolithic landscapes. A possible symbiotic interaction through niche creation on floodplains is postulated between hominins, horses, freshwater fish (particularly eels) and beavers. It is also proposed that this optimal pattern of occupation in the nutritional landscape coupled with low population densities was fundamental to the Palaeolithic diet that was successful in facilitating expansion of hominins outside their evolutionary homelands and the persistent, if episodic, occupation of the less productive higher latitude regions of the northern hemisphere for over half a million years.']"

To improve pregnancy outcomes, the following interventions are needed. Firstly, healthcare providers should carry out health education to raise the public awareness of the risks of maternal pre-pregnancy obesity, central adiposity and weight gain during pregnancy on mothers and their infants. Secondly, women should be guided to keep an ideal BMI and WC prior to pregnancy, to gain optimal weight during pregnancy and to return to a healthy BMI and WC within a reasonable amount of time before the second pregnancy. Last but not least, offering women of childbearing age clinical guidelines on nutrition, diet, physical activity, weight and waist circumference management, as well as emphasizing the importance of self-monitoring.']"
2018-08-02T00:00:00Z,Parental high dietary arachidonic acid levels modulated the hepatic transcriptome of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) progeny,"['Our work has shown that the parental diet modulated the transcription of a range of genes in the adult progeny connected to the fatty acid and retinoid metabolism, methionine cycle, transsulfuration pathway and estrogen signalling. We cannot distinguish if the effect at the transcriptional level is due to the nutritional composition of eggs (oocytes), maternal mRNA deposition or progeny transcriptome potential through programming of the gametes. Modulation of the transcriptome at early life stages can in turn affect metabolic pathways and their activity at later life stages. To our knowledge, the present study is the first one investigating liver transcriptome characteristics of adult zebrafish progeny from parents fed high ARA levels. Nevertheless, further study is required to understand deeper mechanisms on how those gene expression differences observed in adult progeny develop and if these effects can be transferred to future generations.']"
2016-06-02T00:00:00Z,"Effects of Addition of Linseed and Marine Algae to the Diet on Adipose Tissue Development, Fatty Acid Profile, Lipogenic Gene Expression, and Meat Quality in Lambs","['The results indicate that feeding linseed did not affect growth parameters of Navarra breed lambs; nevertheless, the partial substitution of linseed with marine algae reduced ADG and increased slaughter age of lambs. Dietary linseed or linseed and algae decreased the expression of ACACA and SCD in both SC and IM AT and FADS1, FADS2 and ELOVL5 in the IM AT, suggesting a regulation in the novo FA synthesis and a shift in monounsturared FA formation.With reference to adipose tissue development, differences in cellularity as well as in expression of genes related to differentiation and lipogenesis and LCPUFA synthesis, indicate that SC and IM adipose tissues may possess distinct regulation, which results in different fat accretion and varied fatty acid distribution. Supplementing diets with linseed or linseed in combination with algae led to an enrichment of C18:3 n-3 and reduced n-6/n-3 ratio in both SC and IM adipose tissues. Algae addition seemed to be more effective than linseed addition in increasing the physiologically important EPA and DHA content in the studied tissues, but it had adverse effects on meat quality, as the meat from lambs fed linseed with algae presented greater lipid oxidation and reduced ratings for odor, flavor and overall acceptability. The content of ALA, LA and LCPUFA in the diet of lambs is an important factor in the nutritional regulation of lipid metabolism, especially in the LCPUFA synthesis, and further work is needed to elucidate the molecular and biochemical mechanisms controlling the synthesis and deposition of these fatty acids.']"
2018-04-25T00:00:00Z,The timing of growth faltering has important implications for observational analyses of the underlying determinants of nutrition outcomes,"['Despite the broader programmatic influence of seminal research on the importance of growth faltering and wasting in the first 1000 days of life [1, 2], experimental and observational research on linear growth and wasting often only measures partial exposure to underlying determinants of interest without paying due attention to the different age dynamics of growth faltering as defined by HAZ and WAZ or by HAD. The results in this study show that the multivariable regression associations between these indicators and various underlying determinants of nutrition using DHS data are very sensitive to age restrictions, with patterns entirely consistent with the partial exposure bias hypothesis.The clearest limitation of these results is that they are based on cross sectional observational data, implying that these coefficients could suffer from the omission of relevant confounding factors and various types of measurement error, and that any inferences on the dynamics of growth faltering and wasting must be inferred from comparisons across cohorts rather than within cohorts. However, the primary objective of our analysis was to gauge the sensitivity of findings inferred from an already extensive observational literature on the underlying determinants of nutrition. This literature exists because in contrast to the evidence base on specific nutrition programs, experimental evaluations of the nutritional impacts of many underlying factors are costly and difficult to implement. For example, assessing the nutritional impacts of parental schooling would require an extremely extensive and prolonged multi-generational experimental design [8]. Hence there are very few experimental studies assessing the nutritional impacts of programs targeting parental education, household income/assets, access to health services or family planning. In the absence of many such experiments, researchers and policymakers heavily rely on observational analyses to investigate these factors or to infer their role in modelling scenarios; this paper set out to assess how sensitive such analyses are to partial exposure bias.These findings have important implications for future research. For observational analyses of linear growth indicators, minimizing partial exposure bias in studies of underlying determinants generally requires focusing regression analysis on children aged 24 months or older who have completed the first 1000 days of heightened vulnerability to various nutritional insults. One necessary exception would be analyses of the associations between HAZ/stunting and children’s diets [34, 35], since the DHS now only measures dietary outcomes for children 0–23 months (previously many surveys had recorded this information for children 0–35 months). Yet even in this case researchers should test sensitivity to the use of older sub-samples (e.g. 18–23 months) and arguably use sub-samples of older children as the preferred result, as in [36]. Another exception would be analyses focused on specific stages of a child’s growth process, such as studies exploring determinants of postnatal HAZ and its associations with maternal nutrition or prenatal care.For analyses of WHZ or wasting, the opposite strategy is recommended: regression analyses should generally focus on children 0–23 months of age, since these children are much more vulnerable to the various recent insults that influence weight-based nutrition outcomes. At the very least, studies should stratify their analyses by appropriate age brackets, and acknowledge that partial exposure bias can be an important influence on estimated coefficients.These recommendations can easily be implemented with the data often collected in standard surveys. More indirectly, these results also have implications for experimental research and thus for the samples chosen or for the necessary duration of the studies. Nutrition-specific interventions often do give very close consideration to the age dynamics of stunting, but not always. For example, many analyses of nutrition-sensitive interventions, such as sanitation trials, often pay limited attention to this issue, especially when nutrition indicators constitute secondary outcomes of interest [27].These results have important implications for the policy messages inferred from existing research on the determinants of child nutrition, which mostly uses samples of children aged 0–59 months. Our findings suggest that many previous studies have underestimated the impacts of a wide range of underlying determinants on linear growth, particularly parental education and wealth, income and economic growth [4–7]. Interestingly, our analysis of the determinants of child weight for height also suggests that wealth and parental education have much stronger associations with WHZ and wasting in the more appropriate 0–23 month old sample.In summary, we argue that the analytical implications of children’s heightened vulnerability to nutritional insults in the first 1000 days of life have not been appropriately integrated into the large and influential literature engaged in observational analyses of the underlying determinants of child nutrition outcomes. Doing so yields important new results, with household wealth, parental education and many other underlying determinants having stronger associations with stunting and wasting than previous analyses would suggest.']"
2019-08-09T00:00:00Z,Profiling DNA methylation patterns of zebrafish liver associated with parental high dietary arachidonic acid,"['This study has shown that parental dietary ARA influences DNA methylation in zebrafish liver. Hepatic methylation patterns across different genomic regions have been reported in two generations. We identified 2338 loci in the parental livers and 2142 loci in the livers of their progeny showing differential methylation between the dietary groups. We compared the DNA methylation changes in progeny livers to existing gene expression changes, but only based on few gene annotations. Although we reported several genes possibly regulated by diet-associated methylation changes, our results are limited to liver tissue, and causal or functional associations remain undiscovered. Thus, it is possible that the relation between DNA methylation and gene expression changes is stronger during early developmental stages or in tissues other than liver. The effects of nutritional induced DNA methylation changes at specific CpG loci in a transgenerational context and the extent of epigenetic gene regulation need to be verified by further studies.']"
2017-11-22T00:00:00Z,Post-weaning high-fat diet results in growth cartilage lesions in young male rats,"['In conclusion, we have demonstrated, for the first time, that exposure to a HF diet from weaning results in significant lesions in the EGC, typical of articular osteochondrosis. Our results demonstrate that the disturbance in endochondral ossification at the osteochondral junction is strongly correlated with body fat, plasma leptin and plasma TNFα concentrations, and not with exercise. A background of mild lesion incidence in chow-fed animals suggests that lack of exercise is a risk factor. The cellular and molecular mechanism of osteochondrosis is not fully understood in any species, and the relative contribution of body weight, growth rate, physical activity, nutrition and chronic inflammatory state are disputed. Further, molecular or cellular studies in juvenile human tissue are limited. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of the developing growth cartilage to high-lipid feeding, and contribute an additional potential mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of osteochondrosis. The model offers a unique opportunity to determine possible strategies for the prevention or progression of early stable juvenile osteochondrosis in children and adolescents.']"

Despite the participants enjoying receiving social media information regarding pregnancy health, further efforts are needed to educate this high-risk community on prenatal nutrition and to motivate dietary change for maternal and child health outcomes. This is especially important considering that the majority of participants who entered pregnancy as overweight or obese were more likely to experience EGWG during the intervention. Although teens have increased access to social media, the adults had higher levels of participation during this study. Future interventions are needed to further evaluate the type, frequency and sources of sugar consumed by this population and the best way to implement social media interventions in an effective and enjoyable way.']"

Decreased sugar intake was documented in Finland, Norway and Sweden but not in Denmark. Different trends resulted in increased country differences in daily fruit/vegetable consumption during the time of observations. However, despite the positive dietary trends documented in the present study, the majority of Nordic adolescents are far from meeting the recommendation. Furthermore, clear and persistent patterns of social inequality remain. Our findings underline the need for more comprehensive initiatives targeting young people’s food habits. These should be based on systematic evaluations of public health initiatives addressing adolescents’ food habits. Finally, further monitoring of socioeconomic patterns in adolescents’ food habits should be highlighted and considered in the planning of future health promotion targeting adolescent nutrition.']"
2015-04-17T00:00:00Z,Experimental Evaluation of Herbivory on Live Plant Seedlings by the Earthworm Lumbricus terrestris L. in the Presence and Absence of Soil Surface Litter,"['Results of the present study show that L. terrestris damages live plants. This, however, is likely to be a rare event and probably only happens if alternative food such as soil surface litter material is missing. Further experiments should investigate if L. terrestris consumes the torn off plant parts immediately or leaves them on or in the soil to decay and later consumption. Lumbricus terrestris preferred legume litter material over those of grasses and herbs, and data on earthworm weight change suggests that soil surface litter is a crucial component of the diet of this earthworm species which cannot be compensated for by herbivory. Our results on the minor biological significance of earthworm herbivory suggest that earlier herbivory studies ignoring earthworms did not introduce a major artefact. While herbivory on plants beyond the initial seedling stage may only play a minor role in earthworm nutrition and have limited potential to influence plant growth, earthworm effects on plants at the cotyledon stage needs further investigation.']"

The unexpected findings could be due to factors such as, lower BMI, and reduced energy intake. Furthermore, non-GDM women maintained a high DP score for all DPs from pre-pregnancy until second trimester of pregnancy, meanwhile GDM women showed lower and/or inconsistent DP scores, suggesting that non-GDM might have a lower genetic susceptibility to GDM as they are not at risk of GDM despite having also high DP scores for less healthy DPs (pattern 2 and pattern 3). A future large-scale prospective study or a well-designed randomized controlled trial is warranted to further confirm the association between the dietary pattern and the GDM in the Malaysian population. Such findings could inform efforts to strengthen existing or develop appropriate health and nutrition strategies to address the increasing rate of GDM in Malaysia.']"

Further, uterine blood flow was increased in early pregnancy if the heifer was pregnant to a male rather than a female fetus. Sex specific differences in feto-placental perfusion indices exist in the bovine as previously reported in the human [1] and such indices are susceptible to dietary perturbation. The identification of these effects adds to our knowledge of the physiology of male and female fetuses in utero. In accord with a previous report [13] the cardiovascular system of the female fetus was altered by the early in utero low protein diet. Fetal organ development has been shown to be affected by changes in maternal nutrition associated with changes in placental hormone production, with such effects having a sex bias. Altered fetal haemodynamics in utero may be part of the mechanism involved, making further investigation of the sex specific differences present during fetal life important.

Wheat lines with very low content of the specific gluten proteins (near gliadin-free) that are the causal agents for pathologies such as celiac disease were obtained by RNAi. This reduced-gliadin bread has a higher lysine content and similar bread-making quality to normal bread, and therefore could enormously contribute to improve the diet of these patients. Results reported here represent a great advance in the development of food safe for people around the world suffering gluten-related pathologies, with excellent organoleptic properties and greater nutritional quality. However, transgenic wheat is highly regulated and, currently, not commercially grown and this can limit or delay the proposed strategy. The results presented here indicate that flour and bread with reduced levels of these gliadins would be safer for gluten intolerant consumers, although the value of this material still depends on whether or not it can become commercially available, or if these results can be translated into something that is commercially available.']"

2019-08-05T00:00:00Z,Food-type may jeopardize biomarker interpretation in mussels used in aquatic toxicological experimentation,"['According to the present study, Best Available Practices for biomarker-based toxicological experiments should include the appropriate selection and reporting of the food type and feeding regime to achieve reliable and comparable experimental data on the biological effects of pollutants. Commercial food based on frozen or freeze-dried diets might not be the best option for feeding during toxicological experiments, similar to what was earlier shown for aquaculture production [106,118]. Live commercial phytoplankton might be a viable alternative, yet the dietary microalgae should be selected on the basis of the suitable dimension (size, volume, weight) of algal cells, high digestibility and balanced nutritional value [106]. Furthermore, different live microalgae affect biomarkers in different ways. T. chuii that has low digestibility and long gut retention times [114,117,124] appears to influence nutritional status, oxidative stress and digestion processes in mussels. Alternatively, the massive presence of I. galbana within digestive cells may hamper the measurement of fluorescent-based cytochemical biomarkers and may bias biochemical biomarkers due to the high abundance of the algae in the mussel tissue. Interestingly, at low dietary cell concentrations of I. galbana (2×104 cells/mL) the occurrence of microalgae within digestive cells is negligible [125]; however, rations over 2×104 cells/mL are recommended and commonly used in physiological experiments [36, 126]. Further research is needed to optimize dietary food type, composition, regime and rations for toxicological experimentation. Meanwhile, it is important that research papers include a detailed description of the food type and feeding conditions to aid in comparison and interpretation of the biological responses elicited by pollutants in mussels.']"
2016-05-17T00:00:00Z,"Forests, Trees, and Micronutrient-Rich Food Consumption in Indonesia","['Much of the policy rhetoric on food security in Indonesia focuses on production of more rice since it is the main staple food (and thus source of calories) and also important for cultural, political and historical reasons [70]. Increased rice production however, does not address the widespread problem of micronutrient deficiency. Government run micronutrient supplementation programs and public-private partnerships encouraging fortification have been the primary policies targeted at reducing micronutrient deficiencies with little attention paid to dietary quality.The results here suggest that the nature of the landscape and the agrarian context may affect dietary quality and such factors should be considered in both land use policies as well as those aimed at improving nutrition. Our results suggest that forests and tree-based systems could play an important role in supporting dietary quality in Indonesia, but further research is necessary for understanding the exact mechanisms and the regional differences in such relationships.While the results for the aggregate data do not show strong associations between tree dominated land classes and diet, the provincial level analyses exhibit interesting relationships. We do not believe that these results are conclusive, but that they are suggestive enough of important relationships between forests, tree-based systems, and nutrition to warrant further investigation. The fact that the models run on the aggregate sample do not reflect the provincial level results underscores the importance of more targeted research at the local level across different regions of Indonesia. More detailed data on both quantities of food consumed as well as on the definitive land use from different regions is necessary before arriving at conclusions and policy recommendations.Natural forest and semi-natural forest characterized by swidden/agroforestry were positively associated with a larger number of nutritionally important food groups in provinces dominated by these land uses, than timber and palm oil plantations were in the provinces dominated by these land uses. The swidden/agroforestry land use was associated with more frequent consumption of animal source foods which is a particularly important and limited food group for the poor in developing countries. These results together suggest that the nutritional benefits associated with commercial plantations may not be sufficient to compensate for the loss of previous benefits obtained from natural forests and swidden/agroforestry systems. Such a hypothesis however, can only be tested through detailed and rigorous investigation at local scales.']"
2017-11-16T00:00:00Z,The chicken or the egg? Exploring bi-directional associations between Newcastle disease vaccination and village chicken flock size in rural Tanzania,"['Animal health programs–and development programs more broadly–that involve the voluntary investment of funds by local households offer a sustainable pathway to food and nutrition security, which avoids a reliance on ongoing support from governments or donor agencies. Village chickens, ubiquitous throughout rural communities of sub-Saharan Africa, are a worthy target of efforts to alleviate poverty and enhance diet quality. Within this study, the finding of greater flock size following Newcastle disease vaccination provides assurance of the vaccine being handled and administered effectively by local vaccinators. Increased thermotolerance of the I-2 ND vaccine removes the need for a continuous cold chain, but requirements for appropriate storage, transport and ensuring opened vaccine vials are used within an appropriate time period remain important.Equally central to a successful ND control program is the awareness-raising and educational role of the vaccinator within their community. Tanzanian poultry-keepers are familiar with clinical signs and patterns of disease amongst their birds, and, although formal diagnosis is rare, illness and mortality compatible with Newcastle disease (Mdondo in Swahili) is a known entity. Despite this, when financial reserves are scarce, climate patterns unpredictable, available environmental feed resources limited and the threat of predation and theft common, poultry-keepers may be initially reluctant to invest in ND vaccination programs. This study’s finding of increased vaccination uptake by households to whom questions about chicken ownership, management and consumption were posed on a regular basis supports the idea of awareness generating demand for vaccination.As per the age-old “chicken or the egg” conundrum, linkages between vaccination and poultry flock size are confirmed to be bi-directional: vaccination leads to increased flock size, and larger flocks are more likely to be vaccinated. The real dilemma is how to encourage vaccination amongst households with fewer chickens and to support chicken-keepers to vaccinate regularly. One targeted program in Mozambique has involved the distribution of both chickens and ND vaccination vouchers to households affected by HIV/AIDS, allowing community vaccinators to collect payment for their service from two local non-governmental organisations during the first year of a newly introduced ND vaccination program [32]. Opportunities for a similar subsidised vaccination service for vulnerable households elsewhere in Africa, perhaps integrated with existing or future social welfare programs, warrants further exploration. Qualitative approaches to explore household decision-making around chicken health and management, allocation of income, and motivations, challenges and priorities of community vaccinators will be central to the identification and addressing of barriers to broader vaccination coverage.Findings which link chicken flock size with households’ socioeconomic status affirm the value of integrated approaches to poverty alleviation in efforts to enhance food and nutrition security. There is scope for greater economic and nutritional contributions of village chickens, but this may be accelerated when other strategies to increase the household income are in place. In the context of the broader interdisciplinary nutrition-sensitive program of which this study forms a part, the synergistic outcomes of improved crop production and poultry health are proposed to contribute to increased household income, less vulnerability to extreme weather events, greater willingness and capacity to invest in crop and poultry production and, ultimately, improved human nutrition outcomes.']"

While significant genetic differentiation among the 14 sampling sites was not found, individuals formed two clusters in the PCA that roughly corresponded to the northern and southern/central portions of the island, albeit with substantial overlap. The Fst between the two groups was low, and calculations of Fis were comparable, suggesting a consistent excess of homozygosity across the island.A higher correlation between genetic and geographic distance was found in sites on the northern portion of the island compared to the southern/central portion. This divide may be moderately affected by changes in topography, but topography alone does not adequately explain the differentiation between neighboring sites along the uniformly low-lying northern shore. Similarly, no significant difference in body weight at capture was found between animals in the northern and southern/central parts of Mauritius. We hypothesize that the increase in human habitation and tourist infrastructure in northern Mauritius since the 1980s has contributed to, if not created, this effect, as animals supplement their diets with food from anthropogenic sources, reducing both the travel distance required to secure adequate nutrition and contact with neighboring groups.']"
2017-10-20T00:00:00Z,The importance of propolis in alleviating the negative physiological effects of heat stress in quail chicks,"['The results of the present study indicate that dietary propolis supplementation can alleviate the negative effects of heat stress on the growth performance, intestinal histomorphometry, physiology and immunity of Japanese quail. Propolis maintained the normal levels of plasma free T3 hormone, preserved the integrity of intestinal villi and increased the crypts depth in the heat-stressed quail, which consequently enhanced the feed efficiency and growth performance of the quail. The plasma corticosterone and body temperature were decreased in the quail that were fed with propolis, indicating that propolis decreases the stress indicators in quail exposed to heat stress conditions. Moreover, the quail that were fed with propolis expressed good immunity status as presented by a lower H/L ratio and higher lymphocyte proliferation together with the high expression of TLR5 gene. Furthermore, the positive effects of propolis were evidenced by normalizing the high expressions of CASP6-apoptotic gene and Hsp70-stress gene to lower levels in the heat-stressed quail. Therefore, the addition of propolis at a rate of 1 g/kg to the diet of quail could be recommended as a potential nutritional strategy in order to improve their performance, especially under heat stress conditions.']"

Five of the seven associations were with markers near genes associated with the tocochromanol pathway. The availability of the draft of the barley genome sequence, published by the International Barley Genome Sequencing Consortium [28], enabled the alignment of QTLs with candidate genes. This information will be useful in future studies directed at understanding the role(s) of tocochromanols in barley growth, development, stress resistance and productivity.

2014-10-17T00:00:00Z,"Sequential Cross-Species Chromosome Painting among River Buffalo, Cattle, Sheep and Goat: A Useful Tool for Chromosome Abnormalities Diagnosis within the Family Bovidae","['A DNA collection made of 13 probes generated by chromosome microdissection and DOP-PCR was sequentially hybridised on river buffalo, cattle, sheep and goat metaphase spreads in cross-species hybridization experiments. Nearly half of the bovine and goat karyotypes (13 out 30 chromosome pairs), and 40% of the sheep karyotype (11 out of 27 chromosome pairs) were covered. This allowed the development -for the first time- a comparative M-FISH karyotype for the domestic bovids, which represents a fundamental step for the future achievement of: a) health screening programs of the breeds (highly productive, endangered, indigenous, etc…) related to these species on a molecular cytogenetic basis; b) rapid identification of simple and complex chromosomal rearrangements; c) cross-species hybridization experiments within the family Bovidae and more generally, for comparative evolutionary studies with species of other families; d) resolution of complex karyotypes with particular regard to the detection of hybrid animals; e) evaluation of the aneuploidy level in germ cells as tool for the monitoring the reproductive health of animals in relation to management errors (hormonal imbalances, nutritional and diet mistakes) and/or environmental hazards (mutagens, mitotic poisons) which are known to damage the mitotic/meiotic machinery of the cell.']"

However, as the compliance of the vegan diet group was lower than that of the conventional group, and because dietary choices are often personal, it is not realistic to recommend vegan diets to all T2D patients. Nevertheless, this effective diet approach can be applied for T2D patients who are strongly motivated to follow a vegan diet, particularly in the Asian population.']"

Although the diet quality score of SA “needs improvement” (i.e., < 80), they have elevated MetS percentages.Ethnically diverse SA had similar diet quality and acculturation status but gender differences were apparent. SA males had higher diet quality scores and less MetS as opposed to females who had lower diet quality scores and higher MetS.

2016-03-16T00:00:00Z,Murciano-Granadina Goat Performance and Methane Emission after Replacing Barley Grain with Fibrous By-Products,"['This paper provides data on energy partitioning, substrate oxidation, carbon and nitrogen balances, methane emissions and milk performance in Murciano-Granadina goats during midlactation fed mixed diets. Replacing 59% of barley in the diet by dry orange pulp or soybean hulls did not affect milk yield (2.16 kg/d) and no effect was found for chemical composition. The higher starch diet (BRL diet) resulted in positive energy balance and higher fibrous diets showed fat mobilization. On the other hand, the difference in degradation rate between orange pulp and soybean meal (OP diet) and high fat added to the SH diet appear to have affected ruminal fermentation, with greater NH3-N for the OP and SH diets. The OP and SH treatments (lower pentadecanoic acid (C15:0) and higher heptadecanoic acid (C17:0) content in the milk of goats fed fibrous by-product) suggested a negative impact of these diets on rumen bacterial fermentative activity and fat mobilization. Replacement of cereal grain with fibrous by-products did not increase methane emissions (57.4 L/goat per day, on average). Therefore, lactating goats could utilize dry orange pulp and soybean hulls diets with no detrimental effect on milk performance, although attention should be paid to fat added to the diet and the synchrony between the type of fibre and the source of protein used.']"
2014-10-21T00:00:00Z,Psychological Determinants of Consumer Acceptance of Personalised Nutrition in 9 European Countries,"['To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to have modelled factors determining intention to take up personalised nutrition in representative samples of European consumers. An important strength of the study was that the elements of the model have been informed by qualitative research in similar population. These data imply that attitudes towards, and adoption of, personalised nutrition are primarily driven by perceptions of benefit and whether adoption of personalised nutrition is achievable. Trust in regulatory systems (in particular related to data protection) and the extent to which individuals are committed to improving, and perceive that their own actions may influence their own health status and attitudes towards personalised nutrition. This implies that promotion of personalised nutrition to the general public would need to emphasise the (personal) benefits of personalised nutrition. Discussion of risk should focus on end-user concerns, in particular related to data –protection and service delivery. Communication should also address Perceived Efficacy through providing information about how personalised nutrition can be adopted by consumers. Providing information about potential health benefits associated with personalised nutrition may also influence adoption by individuals with low levels of Health Locus of Control.']"
2016-07-08T00:00:00Z,The Effect of Diet Mixing on a Nonselective Herbivore,"['Our results demonstrate that a mixed-diet can support a higher growth rate of a consumer species than the average of single prey species diets. This might be explained by the discrepancy in algae cell size or compensatory feeding. The generalist herbivore did not obtain a higher growth rate when consuming a mixed-diet compared to the best single species diet. Moreover, it is not able to selectively feed and thereby obtain optimal growth by actively regulating their diet and consuming complementary prey. This is however possible for a selective grazer. This means that there is a higher probability of finding support for the balanced-diet hypothesis concerning selective grazers. Therefore, we would like to emphasize the importance of differentiating between selective and non-selective grazers when conducting diet mixing experiments.']"
2019-06-11T00:00:00Z,The relationship between forests and freshwater fish consumption in rural Nigeria,"['Understanding the links between the environmental landscape and food consumption patterns is important for assessing potential trade-offs between forest conservation and food security. For Nigeria, and many other developing countries, fish are a vital source of protein and micronutrients that help to sustain healthy diverse diets. However, the paucity of studies on forest and fish interactions in this region limits our understanding of the importance of forests for wild capture inland fisheries in this region. This study is a first attempt at using existing data sets to investigate whether or not there may be an important link worthy of attention. Here, we find a positive and statistically significant relationship between forests and freshwater fish consumption in Nigeria. This association is particularly strong in the humid and sub-humid regions of Nigeria where forest cover is relatively high. The results from our robustness test showing that this relationship only holds for fresh, and not processed fish, demonstrates that the relationship is not merely a statistical artefact, but indicative of a real relationship. Our findings emphasize the importance of forests for inland fisheries that deliver key sources of food to rural communities in Nigeria.In order to deepen our understanding of these relationships, more detailed purposively collected data are necessary. Greater attention needs to be given to fishing communities in forest landscapes to better account for the importance of fish in rural livelihoods. Data that also targets fish production, seasonality, and fish processing can also enrich our understanding of the relationship between forests, inland fisheries, and food security.The contribution of aquaculture to food production and diets is widely known and acknowledged; [68]; the importance of inland capture fisheries for local livelihoods and diets is, in comparison relatively under documented The research presented here points to forested rivers and floodplains as key contributors to supporting inland fisheries and communities that depend on wild-capture resources, and calls for greater attention on forest-freshwater ecosystems.While there is a common perception that there exists a trade-off between forest conservation and food production, this idea implicitly equates food production with agriculture and most commonly with staple crop production [69]. Aquatic habitats tend to be overlooked in debates about land use and food production, and yet can be critically important sources of nutrient ric h foods that are limited in rural diets in developing countries, particularly for the poor. Research on the benefits and costs of deforestation to local communities has been widely documented (see for example Angelsen and Wunder [70] and Cheng, MacLeod [71]). The evidence presented here suggests that other additional consequences of deforestation also exist that have been relatively unexplored. Deforestation around rivers in particular, could negatively impact fish consumption in areas that are not well integrated into markets. Given the high rates of riparian and floodplain deforestation in Nigeria, a better understanding of what is gained and lost with these land use changes and the potential impacts on the nutrition and health of the communities living in these landscapes is critical.']"
2015-03-13T00:00:00Z,Uncovering the Nutritional Landscape of Food,"['In this study, we have developed a unique computational framework for the systematic analysis of large-scale food and nutritional data. The networks of foods and nutrients offer a global and unbiased view of the organization of nutritional connections, as well as enable the discovery of unexpected knowledge regarding associations between foods and nutrients. Nutritional fitness, which gauges the quality of a raw food according to its nutritional balance, appears to be widely dispersed over different foods, raising questions on the origins of such variations between foods. Remarkably, this nutritional balance of food does not solely depend on the characteristics of individual nutrients but is also structured by intimate correlations among multiple nutrients in their amounts across foods. This underscores the importance of nutrient-nutrient connections, which constitute the network structures embodying multiple levels of the nutritional compositions of foods. Extending our analysis beyond raw foods to cooked foods is necessary to truly understand the nutritional landscape of the foods we consume daily (and is left for further study); however, considering only raw foods was sufficient to draw primary insights from a relatively simple system.A number of applications would become achievable if the concepts presented here are judiciously combined with other practical approaches. The incorporation of region-specific information in our analysis may help design strategies for international food aid [24]. To develop such strategies, one can consider the prioritization of regional foods based on nutritional fitness, suggestions for locally-available dietary substitutes from a food-food network, the fortification of foods using bottleneck nutrients, and so forth. Our study also has implications for personalized nutrition [25]. People of different ages, genders, body compositions, health states, and physical activity levels can obtain their condition-specific information through our method, by simply adjusting the required calorie and nutrient intakes when generating irreducible food sets (S1 Appendix, Section 4.1). The resulting irreducible food sets allow one to compute the nutritional fitness and bottleneck nutrients. This information can be of particular interest to individuals with certain dietary requirements, such as pregnant women, who are recommended to take more nutrients, e.g., essential amino acids and vitamins, than non-pregnant women [26]. On the other hand, it would be interesting to check how different farming methods for each food affect the food’s nutritional composition and thereby its nutritional fitness. Currently, our data source does not provide such information about farming methods (S1 Dataset). Furthermore, considerations of food taste and financial, seasonal, and cultural factors in our analysis may improve the applicability of our methods towards nutritional policy making, nutrition education, and food marketing [1], [27], [28], as well as the aforementioned food aid and personalized nutrition. Finally, our systematic approach sets the foundation for future endeavors to enhance the understanding of food and nutrition.']"

Improving the logistics of providing appropriate equipment and the coverage of training may improve nutrition service delivery. However, there are inherent barriers to implementing nutrition services through the health system including high caseloads, resulting in shorter consultations during ANC and management of sick under-five children. Gestational age specific nutritional counselling package for ANC visits can maximise the efficiency. Missed opportunities to identify undernourished children and lack of time to provide preventive counselling messages can be overcome by introducing well-child clinics in the community or prioritizing home based nutritional screening and counselling by domiciliary workers. Alternative service delivery modes need to be considered including NGOs and other development partners who have demonstrated commitment to nutrition.']"
2015-10-21T00:00:00Z,To See or Not to See: Do Front of Pack Nutrition Labels Affect Attention to Overall Nutrition Information?,"['Our work strongly supports the idea that FOP labels are effective at garnering attention to nutrition information. The added presence of color-coded FOP labels on food packages attracted attention to nutrition information more rapidly and increased the total time that people spent attending to any nutrition information. However, we also found that FOP labels can be used, under certain situations, as a short-cut, thereby decreasing people’s attention to the more comprehensive information found in the NFP. For the scenarios considered in this study, we found no evidence that the presence of FOP labels primed attention to the comprehensive nutrition information on the NFP. These findings have practical implications for policy. First, our finding that FOP labels can, under some circumstances, reduce attention to comprehensive information in the NFP, suggests that any attempt to standardize FOP labels should ensure that that the most important information for making healthy choices appear in the FOP label. Conversely, this “short-cut” finding suggests that manufacturers should not be allowed to selectively report nutrition information on the front-of-pack, as it has the potential to mislead consumers. However, we believe that the attentional benefits of the FOP outweigh the potential negatives. FOP labels produced a dramatic increase in the speed with which people attended to nutrition information, and increased the overall amount of time spent attending to nutrition information. Moreover, the existing literature suggests that FOP labels may not act as a short-cut when people are explicitly interested in nutrition information [54] and that these labels can catalyze more healthful choices [61] for a sustained period of time [56]. Given the magnitude of the evidence that too few people currently attend to nutrition information [62], raising awareness, even to partial nutrition information, constitutes a step towards fostering informed food choices and potentially impacting overall dietary quality.In short, FOPs are likely to increase attention to nutrition information among the common shopper who is not explicitly interested in nutrition information. However, the information that appears within the FOP may be particularly influential when evaluating the health of the food, so regulators must carefully consider the type of information that should appear within a standardized FOP.']"

This approach avoids double-counting of environmental burdens. The approach was developed to be consistent with the AGRIBALYSE® database, which will allow future use of the ECOALIM dataset for feed formulation based on environmental impacts and environmental labelling of animal products. The ECOALIM dataset relies on representative and recent data that cover a wide range of production practices in France. Built with organisations such as feed manufacturers, raw material producers and R&D institutes, this dataset contains feed ingredients necessary to formulate complete feeds and several French feed ingredients for which no data were available before (i.e. sorghum, flaxseed, and soya bean). The ECOALIM dataset will allow feed formulas to be developed which incorporate nutritional, economic and environmental constraints. This new approach to designing diets needs further research to evaluate its potential as an option for mitigating livestock-related impacts. It would be interesting to conduct a similar study in other countries with the same degree of accuracy in LCI data of feed ingredients. The framework developed in the AGRIBALYSE® database and ECOALIM dataset is adequate to further develop such databases.']"

In this study maternal coffee consumption and hookworm infection during pregnancy are key predisposing factors to maternal anemia. Hence, a more comprehensive and community-wide deworming intervention should be performed. All pregnant women coming to antenatal clinics should be screened and treated routinely for intestinal parasitic infection. Anti‑helminthes should be given as prophylaxis to adolescent and young adult women, before their reproductive career. Stool analysis and nutrition intervention should be strongly inculcated into the routine maternity services during antenatal care. We also suggest sustained health education on the dietary intake, access to health care, clean water, hygiene and sanitation for women of reproductive age group particularly, pregnant women. Iron-folate supplementation combined with de-worming will also have affirmative input. The inhibiting effects of coffee on iron absorption can be partially prevail by the concurrent intake of vitamin C rich foods and diet of animal origin. Moreover, pregnant women should limit coffee consumption, and avoid drinking coffee with meals. Causal relationships between maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy and anemia should be further investigated with strong study design.']"

2018-03-22T00:00:00Z,Influence of vegetable diets on physiological and immune responses to thermal stress in Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis),"['In spite of some diet-induced differences in the assessed parameters, all groups of fish were able to develop typical physiological responses (increased cortisol and increase glucose mobilization) against the stressor. The current data suggests that the interactions observed between the dietary use of vegetable diets and the physiological stress response pointed to a slightly inhibited stress response with the use of vegetable diets. For instance, the effect of thermal stress on hepatic lactate, serotonergic neurotransmission in brain, and the activity of ACH50 in plasma decrease in fish fed vegetable diets. However, V50 diet showed stress/diet interactions in plasmatic parameters indicative of stress, which could probably be attributed to the effect of the specific FA composition of this diet on HPI axis activation. Regardless of the interaction with the stress physiology, the total substitution of dietary FO by VO (V100) in Senegalese sole could affect some energetic parameters (plasmatic glucose and lactate or glucose and glycogen in liver) as well as ACH50 which could lead to higher susceptibility of fish to suffer health diseases. Further studies regarding the susceptibility of Senegalese sole to the effect of pathogenic agents related to the prolonged use of total vegetable diets would clarify this aspect.']"
2014-08-18T00:00:00Z,A Possible Link between Food and Mood: Dietary Impact on Gut Microbiota and Behavior in BALB/c Mice,"['Based on the negatively affected memory, the impaired species-specific behavior, which is thought to reflect capability of human daily activities, the diet-induced change in GM and the association between GM and anhedonic-like behavior in mice receiving a high-fat diet, our results suggests that a diet high in saturated fat contributes to development of depression-like behavior, and that changes in the GM may be considered a mediator. Levels of LPS, cholesterol, HbA1c, cytokines or BDNF could not explain the observed diet-induced behavior. The effect of a high-sucrose diet on behavior may be mediated through other metabolic pathways, as we saw no significant change in the GM of feces and cecum in this diet group. However, it cannot be excluded, that the high-sucrose diet impacted the GM of the small intestine, secondly modulating the immune system and behavior. Importantly, we show that fat and sucrose affect behavior differently and sometimes oppositely, and thus the proportion of fat and sugar in the diet should be paid more interest when designing behavioral studies. Finally, we documented a wide association between the GM, behavior, BDNF, and the immune system, and although not stating causality, the present study emphasizes the need for more research into the impact of the GM on behavior both in general and in disease.']"

Whereas cattle fed a high-roughage diet did not use the gate until over an hour after feed delivery, those fed a low-roughage diet worked to obtain hay immediately after its delivery and did so before consuming any of their primary diet the majority of the time. Regardless of their primary diet, cattle pushed nearly half of their bodyweight to access a small portion of hay. The use of the gate by heifers with free access to hay is the first demonstration of contrafreeloading in cattle. In conclusion, consuming roughage is important to domestic cattle, and this desire is affected by both their primary diet and an internal motivation to work to obtain feed.']"

2016-01-13T00:00:00Z,Is Western Diet-Induced Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in Ldlr-/- Mice Reversible?,"['Long-term WD feeding was used to induce NASH in Ldlr-/- mice. We tested the efficacy of two low-fat, low-cholesterol diets to promote NASH remission. While most gene expression markers, all plasma parameters examined, and body weights returned to normal, this intervention failed to reverse both hepatic fatty acid profiles and NASH-associated fibrosis. Based on these studies, removing WD and switching to low fat-low cholesterol (NP or LFLC) diets is not sufficient to allow for full resolution of NASH. These studies also demonstrated a differential response of NASH remission dependent upon the diet used. The NP diet was superior to the LFLC diet in resolving NASH. This suggests that the beneficial results of these diets are not solely based on removal of fat and cholesterol from the diet, but may also depend on the level of dietary simple sugar, i.e., sucrose and fructose. Whether full resolution, and in particular, removal of fibrosis occurs with continued weight maintenance, addition of exercise, or targeted drug therapies coupled with lifestyle changes is yet to be determined.']"
2019-08-29T00:00:00Z,The Pacific harbor seal gut microbiota in Mexico: Its relationship with diet and functional inferences,"['In this study, we describe the gut microbiota function and composition of wild colonies of harbor seals in Baja California. Contrary to our expectations, higher variability in the diet found in harbor seal colonies in close proximity to each other was not reflected in differences in the gut microbiota structure. We observed variation in the diversity and richness among the northern (PBE and TS) and the southern (N-TS) harbor seal colonies. The coastal harbor seal colony studied in the present research showed a higher level of gut microorganisms diversity and richness which could be explained by the acquisition of environmental bacteria due to the individuals’ proximity to the land and the higher number of prey consumed. Future research on the gut microbiota should be focused on the apparently vulnerable PBE colony in order to understand the impact of human disturbance on the composition of the gut microbiota and its probable effect on the seals’ health.As in previous studies of the mammalian gut microbiome, our study also found correlations between diet and microbial composition. A high polyunsaturated lipid content in the prey consumed by harbor seals may be a major factor shaping the gut microbiota community and its function. Information on the nutritional values of the prey and the harbor seals’ nutrient requirements may provide insight into its prey preferences. Moreover, further metagenomic approaches would allow an understanding of the dynamic nature of the gut microbial community, and its metabolic capabilities, and role in the harbor seal’s feeding habit.Our study represents a first insight into the factors that shape the gut microbiota of wild harbor seals, such as environmental conditions and the prey consumed. Harbor seals are non-migratory animals that forage near their colonies, due to which behavior, changes in the gut microbial composition can be attributed to changes in the location of their colonies, giving an idea of the relationship between the health status of the harbor seal and its surrounding environment. This information could not only be used to position the harbor seal as an environmental sentinel species for the Baja California coast and its islands, but may also contribute to the conservation of the subspecies.']"

2016-09-20T00:00:00Z,What Explains Cambodia’s Success in Reducing Child Stunting-2000-2014?,"['The framework for the analysis of child nutrition in terms of immediate, underlying and basic causes has underpinned most empirical studies on improvements in child nutrition in developing countries. However, to understand the child nutrition transitions in developing countries, the determinants derived from this framework need to be modelled flexibly, allowing their impacts to vary across the distribution of child nutrition outcomes, over time and between rural and urban areas. A flexible modelling approach can provide a more nuanced understanding of child nutrition transitions, as the important drivers for change may be different for severely stunted children and moderately stunted children and for rural and urban areas. The returns to the conventional determinants–the translation of household endowments, characteristics and practices into gains in child nutrition–may be influenced by macroeconomic factors and shocks. The conventional determinants may not fully or adequately explain changes in child nutrition in developing countries, which highlights the need to explicitly consider the role of targeted child health and nutrition interventions. The main insights from the analysis can inform the design of policy and programme interventions. Nutrition interventions need to focus on the determinants that have the largest impact in the lower quantiles of the child HAZ score distribution to reduce the incidence of stunting. Further, the nature of interventions may need to be different in rural and urban areas. Maternal best practices and parental education appear to be the most promising areas for intervention in rural areas, whereas improvements in socio-demographic endowments like wealth may produce a larger impact in urban areas. Importantly, policy makers need to consider the efficacy with which conventional determinants translate into improvements in child HAZ scores and on the macro-economic developments and public health infrastructure that influence this efficacy. While targeted child nutrition interventions may be making a larger contributions to reduction in stunting, there is very limited data at present on the coverage, quality and impacts of these programmes in most developing countries. Empirical impact assessments of these interventions should be a priority area for future research.']"

2019-10-15T00:00:00Z,Consumer beliefs about healthy foods and diets,"['This report conveys the results of a nationwide survey of 1,290 U.S. food consumers, with primary focus on consumers’ perceptions of healthy food. The FDA has signaled efforts to re-define the terms for use on food labels, and as such, insights into how consumers define and interpret has been sought by the FDA [28].Slightly more consumers than not thought a food could be deemed healthy based solely on the foods’ nutritional content. However, it was also the case that slightly more consumers than not thought healthiness is a characteristic of one’s overall diet and the combination of foods consumed rather than something that can be determined looking at individual foods. There were four broad types of consumers with about a quarter falling into each of four categories of views about healthy: food-nutrient focus, food-nonnutritive focus, diet-nutrient focus, and diet-nonnutritive focus. Such findings presenting something of a challenge because “healthy” labels appear on individual foods rather than on combinations of foods (i.e. an overall diet). Given that roughly half of consumers view “healthy” as a purview of one’s over-all diet rather than a specific food, it suggests food-specific healthy labels may be less impactful for a significant portion of the population. Moreover, current “healthy” labels are based exclusively on a food’s nutrient content, which according to half this survey sample, is insufficient to determine whether a food, for them, is considered healthy.Ratings of individual food products according to healthiness reveals that “healthy” is not a single unifying construct, but rather consumers evaluate healthiness along a number of different dimensions or factors related to animal origin, preservation, and freshness/processing. Focusing on individual nutrients, perceived healthiness is generally decreasing in a food’s fat, sodium, and carbohydrate content and increasing in protein content. Only about 2% of consumers jointly rated high fat and low carbohydrates as the healthiest nutrient combination.About 40% of consumers thought a healthy label implied they should increase consumption of the type of food bearing the label, and indeed about 15% thought the label meant they could eat all they wanted. A little over a third of respondents (34.7%) indicated that a healthy label would not mean anything to them.While a slight majority of consumers (54%) felt the FDA should regulate the use of the term “healthy” by requiring companies to follow a uniform, consistent definition, only about 19% believed the FDA should keep the current definition, raising questions about how–exactly–consumers believe the term should be defined.There are some limitations to the present study. The survey data originate from a non-probability based (or “opt-in”) panel maintained by a marketing research firm. Prior research suggests the accuracy of non-probability internet samples is lower than that of probability based phone or internet samples, although post-stratification weighting sometimes helps reduce inaccuracies [36]. Nonetheless, in recent years use of non-probability based internet samples has expanded rapidly in marketing and academic research as well as political polling [37, 38], and there is evidence that even highly non-representative samples are just as accurate as forecasting election outcomes as more traditional methods [39] and that differences between different probability based samples can be as large as the difference between probability-based and non-probability based samples [40]. The trend toward opt-in online panels may be explained in part by the significantly lower cost of non-probability based samples as well as emerging problems with conventional survey approaches. For example, [41] posits that the difference between opting out of a probability sample (which often have response rates less than 10%) and opting in to a non-probability sample is practically nill (see also [42]). Moreover, the emergence of mobile phones and unlisted numbers has made random-digit dialing techniques less reliable [37] and there has been a significant decline in response rates and data quality even in “high quality” government surveys [43]. The use of post-stratification weights in this study forces the sample to match the population in terms of selected demographic variables, and any degree of inaccuracy arising from the use of a non-probability based sample is unknown.There are a number of avenues for future research. This survey included questions asking about health perceptions of macro nutrients (i.e., fat, protein, carbohydrates). Future research on perceptions of micronutrients such as different types of fats (e.g., saturated vs. unsaturated) or carbohydrates (e.g., whole vs. refined grains; added vs. natural sugars) would also provide useful information relative to health perceptions. It could also be of interest to inquire about other policy preferences. In this study, respondents were asked a broad question about consumer’s perception of the FDA’s role in regulating and defining a claim like “healthy.” It might also be useful, however, to inquire as to whether and how consumers believe, conditional on the fact the FDA already defines healthy, the label definition should be updated over time.Overall, results of this study suggest consumer’s perceptions of “healthy,” which is primarily based on fat content, partially aligns with the FDA definition, but findings also suggest consumers perceive the word as a broader and more nuanced concept that defies easy, uniform definition. Given heterogeneity in beliefs about the definition of healthy, findings from this study suggest such labels may need to be accompanied with nutrition education or that on-package disclosures may need to accompany health claims so that consumers know what, precisely, is being communicated. Nationwide nutrition education around the label claim “healthy” is likely to be costly and results of such a campaign are uncertain. Such considerations point to on-package definitions/disclosures as a more effective means of communicating the federal definition of “healthy.”']"
2019-02-28T00:00:00Z,Mother’s nutrition-related knowledge and child nutrition outcomes: Empirical evidence from Nigeria,"['The determinants of child nutrition outcomes explored in this study have great policy implications for Nigeria and are also applicable to other countries with similar characteristics. The findings emanating from this study improve our understanding of the independent role that mother’s nutrition-related knowledge can play on child nutrition outcomes. Mother’s knowledge of food choices, feeding, and health care seeking are vital for producing good nutrition outcomes for young children. The present level of mother’s educational attainment in rural Nigeria is not sufficient to reinforce knowledge in producing better nutrition outcomes for children. In such populations with limited access to formal education, mother’s knowledge of health and nutrition may substitute for education in reducing undernutrition in young children. Particular effort should therefore be made to ensure this knowledge is rightly acquired. Other means of knowledge acquisition for mothers who do not have a formal education or cannot complete education above primary school should be employed. More importantly, programs should identify which child care practices should be encouraged to enhance maternal and child nutrition and health; promoting such could mitigate the negative association of mother’s lack of education with children’s health. Finally, adult education through behavioral change communications would be an effective means for reaching out to poor and less educated Nigerian women.']"
2015-09-09T00:00:00Z,"Healthcare Costs Associated with an Adequate Intake of Sugars, Salt and Saturated Fat in Germany: A Health Econometrical Analysis","['As investigated in this study, an association of dietary factors (in particular an excessive intake of MDS, salt and SFA) and of clinical endpoints with related treatment costs exists for a broad set of diseases, with direct healthcare costs totalling 16.8 billion EUR in Germany (CI95%: 6.3–24.1 billion EUR). In other words: These costs could be saved if people’s intake of MDS, salt and SFA were adequate. However, since this study only considered direct medical treatment costs related to an adequate intake, the actual potential societal and economic gains—resulting both from direct and indirect cost savings—may be higher than 16.8 billion EUR. Moreover, against the backdrop of a steadily ageing society and the foreseeable increases in disease burdens over the coming decades, this figure may well rise (not only nominally, but also when adjusted for inflation).It follows that measures aimed at optimizing diets and recipes could be used as effective leverage in order to relieve pressure on healthcare, health insurance and national tax levy systems. Health insurance companies, governmental institutions, but also commercial enterprises, which should have an intrinsic interest in the health of their employees and customers, will therefore be required to develop proper incentive mechanisms that facilitate healthier nutrition. In particular, companies in the food, beverage and catering industries should be supported in their efforts to optimize existing recipes, and develop new ones (possibly by introducing new components) with enhanced nutritive performance, allowing all customers easier and healthier food choices.With regard to a possible fat substitution, it has to be kept in mind that the food matrix may have an influence on the nutritive impact of the specific component. With this in mind, when designing new fat substitutes it seems most important that substitutes meet the haptic and technological requirements of meat products (see discussion). Furthermore, when compared to SFAs, poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) showed the strongest risk-decreasing effect for developing ischemic heart diseases, followed by mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and carbohydrates.As far as a possible salt substitution is concerned, trade-offs must be considered with respect to an adequate iodine supply. Presently, more than 50% of the average iodine supply in Germany occurs via the intake of common table salt [20]. So if salt substitutes with a better nutritive profile are to be used in food products, it should be possible to enrich them with iodine.The findings of this study confirm the imperative of the UN High-Level Review on Non-Communicable Diseases, in which governments agreed to intensify and accelerate efforts towards creating a world free of the avoidable burden of NCDs [71]. The High-Level Review is based on the NCD Global Monitoring Framework (WHO, 2013) [72], which identified a set of nine core targets to minimize the impacts of NCDs by 2025. Four out of these nine core targets can be addressed by a balanced consumption of salt (targets 1, 4, 6 and 8), whereas target 7 (“Halt the rise in diabetes & obesity”) as well as target 1 (“A 25% relative reduction in the overall mortality from NCDs”) can be achieved by a balanced intake of MDS and SFA.']"
2019-06-24T00:00:00Z,Impact of early protein and energy intakes on neurodevelopment at 2 years of corrected age in very low birth weight infants: A single-center observational study,"['Among a single-center cohort of VLBW infants over a three-year period, a higher early protein intake and non-protein energy intake were associated with higher odds of neurodevelopmental impairment at 2 years’ corrected age. This highlights the contradictory hypothesis that greater protein intakes in early life improve neurodevelopmental outcome like previous studies. However, these results confirm the recent recommendation to decrease amino acid intakes published in the latest ESPGHAN guidelines. When the standard nutrition is below optimal, providing more nutrition may be beneficial. Nevertheless, providing nutrition above the optimal level may not be beneficial and may even be harmful. This study also confirms the strong relationship from neonatal comorbidities to early providing nutrition with an influence on later neurodevelopmental outcome. Further studies are necessary to improve our knowledge and nutritional practices in VLBW infants.']"

The significant predictors of LBW were being poor, not attending ANC, MUAC less than 23 cm, experience of physical violence during the index pregnancy and longer time to walk to health facility. This is significant because LBW is highly associated with neonatal and infant morbidity and mortality.Improving access to health care and improving the nutritional status of women particularity pregnant women would reduce the occurrence of LBW.In Ethiopia, all rural Kebeles are staffed with health extension workers; these health workers are expected to provide house to house health promotion services. In this regard, they should emphasize providing ANC for the pregnant women. Through ANC, it is possible to identity a women who are at risk of having LBW baby. Giving necessary advice such as the need for balanced diet and provision of health promotion intervention such as provision of iron tables for the anemic can be easily facilitated.In addition, empowering women, families and neighborhoods to work on their own health care such as peer discussion to use ANC, would reduce the number of babies borne having LBW. These activities would prevent not only the occurrence of LBW but also problems associated with LBW such as child morbidity and most importantly child mortality thereby helps the country achieve child MDG targets.']"

Based on this method, we filled gaps in the current knowledge of the shearwater diet during the prebreeding period. Our results indicate the importance of deep-sea fishes as stable food resources for shearwaters throughout the sampling seasons, although diet composition significantly differed between the prebreeding and rearing periods. Further investigations by tracking individual foraging behavior may improve our knowledge of wedge-tailed shearwater diet composition as it relates to foraging strategies.The DNA metabarcoding approach is sensitive, and its application to fecal samples does not disturb seabirds because it is noninvasive, which facilitates diet monitoring. Long-term and wide-ranging studies of seabird diets using DNA metabarcoding may be useful for detecting changes in marine ecosystems and/or investigating the potential impacts of fisheries and climate changes.']"

Although an understanding of diet–microbiome–disease interactions is critical for humans, we propose alternative animal model systems to test fundamental properties of this potential interaction. These animals are relevant to agriculture and epidemiology, and they allow for carefully controlled experiments with few constraints on sample size. Most importantly, they are tractable systems that have strong evidence of each separate interaction: diets modulate resistance to parasites, diets alter gut microbiomes, and gut microbiomes modulate parasitism (Fig 2). Existing experimental tools now allow researchers to build on the separate, direct relationships to determine whether there is an indirect link between host diet, host gut microbiome, and parasite infection. Elucidation of the importance and ubiquity of such a link will help us better understand the therapeutic potential of diets and gut microbiomes to control infectious disease.']"

The different ADM recipes optimized for specific biological characters were able to directly increase those corresponding biological and physiological characters themselves. The specifically optimized ADMs could enable O. sauteri to be reared in a customized culture set-up. The introduction of sinkaline and honey was beneficial in terms of their effects on the biological and physiological characters examined, compared with traditional artificial diet recipes. We also found that an alternative lepidopteran diet ingredient, pupae of A. paphia, had beneficial effects on the mass rearing of O. sauteri. Intensive respiratory and locomotory tests were used to evaluate the end effect of the different artificial diet recipes. Successive examinations of mating preference, predatory ability and population dispersion showed great benefits for practical biological control application by using the present optimal ADMs. However, more studies are required to further determine the efficacies of such artificial diets in the mass rearing of O. sauteri and other insects for biological control.']"

At the policy level, adequate investments in improved emergency outbreak preparedness across the food value-chain may put nutritional health systems in more timely and coordinated positions to address not only the direct threat of an infectious disease but also the indirect toll that poor nutrition takes on community health. At the organizational level, nutrition programme planners should ensure necessary resources and capacity to ensure a combination of nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive response options prioritizing community involvement in design, coordination, and implementation across the food value-chain. These important lessons learned should be adapted to other contexts, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, where a very similar EVD outbreak has been occurring since 2018 [52]. Disasters of this magnitude may unavoidably face food security challenges, yet taking an interdisciplinary approach by convening experts from disciplines across the value chain for preparedness planning, for instance, may help to mitigate such widespread nutrition effects in similar complex emergencies.']"

Our analysis of the appropriate literature data also confirms that a low-FODMAP diet is more effective than standard IBS dietary therapy in patients diagnosed with IBS. However, a low-FODMAP diet raises certain issues, such as the alteration of gut microbiota and inadequate nutrient intake without dietitian assistance. The possible health advantages of a low-FODMAP diet—when it is effective—compared to medical treatment require further evaluation. In consideration of its possible limitations and based on findings from this meta-analysis, a low-FODMAP diet could be a potential first-line and supplementary dietary therapeutic approach with the aid of a dietitian for patients with irritable bowel syndrome to improve abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, bloating and quality of life. Because of the lack of published data, it is not possible to prove the effect of a low-FODMAP diet on bowel movement frequency in IBS patients.

This diet–induced gastroenteropathy could not be classified under any particular cluster of gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases (i.e. inflammatory bowel-, celiac- disease or idiopathic colitis), but it shared many overlapping clinical features. Dietary interventions are commonly used to create models of diet-induced obesity and this usually involves the introduction of food sources that are atypical of the standard primate diet. We have shown that the ingredients used to create these diets must be carefully reviewed and cross-referenced with not only the standard primate diet, but also the overall dietary and clinical history of the captive colony. While other forms of food sensitivities and intolerances can result in immediate noticeable symptoms, this was not the case in our studies and resulted in late diagnosis. Diet-related changes should be carefully reviewed and taken into consideration when diagnosing any gastrointestinal disorders in captive macaques.']"

Overall the dietary treatments produced effects on the expression of the tested genes. The use of both multivariate CDA and univariate ANOVA analyses allowed to better identify the gene interactions related to biological processes. Indeed, the results suggested that adding plant extract (source of polyphenols) and linseed (source of n-3 PUFA) stimulates the expression of genes involved in the control of muscle metabolism, leading to a mutual interaction between lipogenesis and oxidative processes in the Longissimus thoracis muscle of pigs. This stimulation was more evident in the diet supplemented with polyphenols and n-3 PUFA compared to a diet only enriched in n-3 PUFA. On the contrary, the integration of vitamin E and Selenium in the diet did not significantly alter the expression of the tested genes in comparison to the diet with only linseed supplementation. These results were a first step in the formulation of functional diets for pigs addressing consumers’ demand for healthy meat products.']"
2014-02-24T00:00:00Z,Intra- and Interspecific Differences in Diet Quality and Composition in a Large Herbivore Community,"['The diet niche of a species is dynamic and depends on joint processes of forage selection and resource availability (e.g. [55], [18], [24], [48]). Our study, investigating whether diet’s patterns (in terms of composition and quality) and changes in diet agree with prediction from body mass or rumen type, shows that diet assemblage is a complex process, and that this complexity in how large herbivore exploit and share food resources needs to be interpreted in the light of other ecological or behavioural echanisms such as space use at a larger scale or plant organ selection at the bite scale. Our results concur with [66] who suggested that species differences in terms of diet may be less pronounced in European herbivore communities than in African ones. The approach we undertook, by analysing species-specific relationship between diet composition and diet quality, should however be tested in more diverse communities, such as in Africa, before concluding that distinction in diets is more blurred in Europe than in Africa. It also points out towards several lines for future research concerning methodological, morphophysiological and ecological aspects. For instance, as pointed out by [27] or [48], results on diet breadth and overlap have to be interpreted with caution, given that studies based on either microhistology (in the cases of feces analyses) or identification through microscope (as with gut samples) do not allow determining all plant eaten to the species level. This can lead to an underestimation of the number of species, with a more pronounced effect for some plants groups (forbs and grasses) than for others. Resorting to more precise identification, such as DNA-barcoding [67], [68], would be a helpful way to reevalute such results (e.g. [69]). We have also underlined the need for a better understanding of which plant parts are selected by each herbivore species, as this may contribute to explain why the diet composition to diet quality relationship can be species-specific [34]. This is fundamental to better understand the connection between diet assemblages and the energy acquired by individuals and ultimately, demographic performances. Finally, the impact of a large community of herbivores, diverse in its patterns of food resource use, would need to be explored further, because it can impact both primary and secondary production to an extent that has been little evaluated so far [70]. This is particularly true in mountains, where changes in temperature and land use occur rapidly [68], and where the role of large herbivores on landscape dynamics and the maintenance of biodiversity may become large now that the populations of all species have increased in numbers and distribution [34].']"

We did, however, find an effect on spectral sensitivity. The peak of spectral sensitivity of individuals fed a 5% taurine diet was rightward shifted (i.e., towards longer wavelengths) relative to that of fish fed 0% or 1.5% taurine diets. This difference in spectral sensitivity was caused by a relatively lower level of a middle wavelength pigment (maximum absorbance .500 nm) in fish fed a 5% taurine diet. Changes in spectral sensitivity resulting from diets containing different taurine levels are unlikely to be detrimental to fish destined for market but could be in fishes fed plant-based diets that are being reared for stock enhancement through the release of large fish.']"
2016-11-04T00:00:00Z,Constitutive and Operational Variation of Learning in Foraging Predatory Mites,"['Our study provides evidence that thrips experience by A. swirskii females early in life alters their behavior towards this prey as adults, and is one of a few studies rigorously comparing the effects of associative and non-associative learning in one and the same learning task. Rearing diet had a decisive influence on learning performance, but our experimental design was not apt to elucidate the mechanisms of the compromised learning ability of predatory mites reared on pollen. We argue that the observed behavioral changes indicate a reduced learning ability as a consequence of either nutritional deficiency, nutrient allocation shift or laboratory selection, but further research is needed to shed light on these matters. The finding that population origin, long-term mass rearing on a factitious prey, did not compromise learning, as compared to the population collected in the field, is relevant for the use of A. swirskii in biological control. The presence of a specific prey or their cues during rearing may increase the efficacy of the biological control agents, if these are then better able to recognize, handle and attack this prey in the crop. Amblyseius swirskii is widely used in biological control of thrips [43,44,51], but is commonly mass-reared on astigmatic mites and thus does never experience thrips before release in the greenhouse crop [52,53]. As previously suggested [28,40], evaluating ways to prime or condition biological control agents before their release in the field, and thus, enhance their efficacy against a specific pest, represents exciting future research topics.']"

In addition, there were no differences in results between the use of lard or corn oil as the fat source in the HF diet. Adding GTE to the HF diet suppressed body fat accumulation and was accompanied by increased hepatic and skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation enzyme activity. Moreover, a sex difference in body fat distribution was identified in the zebrafish. All of these results are similar to those found in mammals, suggesting that zebrafish can serve as a suitable animal model in research into obesity induced by a diet rich in fat.']"

Exploring patient views on the prescribed diet provided valuable information for clinical practice and insight on how patients’ managed their diets to slow the progression of ADPKD. Overall, participants in this study felt positive about making dietary changes, willing to continue to decrease the consumption of sodium and protein, increase the consumption of fruits, vegetables, and fluids, and became much more aware of their dietary behaviors. Participants reported being able to reduce sodium, restrict protein intake, increase fruit and vegetable intake, and consume the appropriate amount of fluids with ease. The primary barriers to following the diet were attending social events and traveling. Participants reported that tracking their diet was tedious and that improvements should be focused on improving that aspect of the dietary regimen. This study demonstrates that while patients are able to adhere to a low-sodium, low-protein diet attenuated with fruits, vegetables, and fluids in the short-term, improving how they track and monitor their intake is necessary if planning to adhere to the diet over one’s lifetime.']"

The difference between omnivorous and insectivorous species is clear. Those species that do not completely met the expectations of stress level for their diet can be explained with a more detailed study of their diet. D. kappleri has a lower jaw more resistant than its genera counterparts. However it remains unclear whether this is due to a different diet, an allometric effect, or other factors.For the extinct species studied, all of them outside the range of insectivorous diet, some conclusions can be derived. The fossil taxon Vassallia maxima presented a very strong mandible, congruent with an herbivorous diet with a great amount of oral processing and in agreement with Vizcaíno et al. [17] morphofunctional studies. On the other hand, Eutatus seguini shows a stress pattern similar to Vassalia in the posterior part, but to Macroeuphractus outesi in the anterior part of its very strong mandible.

The micro-geographic disparities widened with increasing education mothers achieved. The association of maternal education with child nutritional status may vary by micro-geographic locations, with a negative association in mountain areas and positive associations in plain and in edge areas, respectively. Thus, enlarging female education alone is not sufficient; improving unfavorable conditions in mountain areas can make such investments more effective in promoting child health. Moreover, malnutrition in plain and in edge areas continues to be of concern, and effective targeting of nutrition programs to the least educated groups in plain and in edge areas will be critical to their cost-effectiveness.']"

However, the prevalence of stunting is very high and it is considered as a major public health concern among school-aged children in Arba Minch HDSS, Southern Ethiopia. The likelihood of stunting was significantly higher among older school age children and children who were non-enrolled in schools. Being male, and living in households with lower wealth index were also associated with increased odds of stunting. Therefore, this finding warrants the need to implement school health and nutrition programs to improve the nutritional status of school-age children in the study area. The interventions should focus towards both gender and special emphasis should also be given to increase the enrollment of children in schools. In addition, effort should be taken by stakeholders in different hierarchies to improve the family wealth status. Moreover, more-large scale studies or the national nutritional surveys need to consider school-age children as one component to regularly assess the nutritional status of this age group.']"

Though poor complementary feeding is prevalent in poor areas of rural China, our qualitative findings suggest that poverty itself does not constrain feeding practices and caregivers attempt to provide for their children as best as they can. Therefore, the absence of nutritional knowledge needs to be addressed by future policies in order to improve long-run health and human capital outcomes in China.In order to combat the high prevalence of inadequate feeding practices, we suggest implementing nutritional campaigns targeted at caregivers of young children in rural China that focus primarily on promoting micronutrient supplementation. Such an educational campaign can be carried out by local government workers who have established positive relationships with villages and therefore would be a trusted source that caregivers could turn to when seeking nutritional information. Implementing such a measure can both increase caregivers' access to reliable sources of information, and their knowledge of infant and child nutrition. By doing so, these measures may effectively combat some of the most serious impediments to proper children's feeding practices and consequently their nutritional status, health, growth and development in rural China.""]"

The results show findings for the UK but the same methodology could be applied to any country with detailed food composition data. The study also provides an alternative view of self-sufficiency by looking at the dependence on imports to meet population-level nutritional requirements, rather than viewing self-sufficiency from an economic perspective. The concept of self-sufficiency could be broadened from a unidimensional perspective to include multiple factors, such as economics and nutrition security. As an approach to determine nutrition security at a national level, this study provides a method to monitor the progress toward delivering some of the sustainable development goals in terms of a national supply of sufficient nutrients to meet population requirements.']"

2020-01-15T00:00:00Z,The effect of diet on the gastrointestinal microbiome of juvenile rehabilitating green turtles (Chelonia mydas),"['In conclusion, once wild green turtles recruit to coastal waters, they feed on a primarily herbivorous diet of seagrass and algae. Nevertheless, many rehabilitation facilities offer a seafood-based diet early in rehabilitation to combat poor appetite and emaciation, and some hospitals and aquaria offer seafood constantly throughout captivity. Our results indicate that the GI microbiome of green turtles in rehabilitation changed significantly after consuming a seafood-based diet, from a community suited to metabolizing plant polysaccharides (i.e. the natural flora) to one adapted to digesting animal protein. These findings are important for providing this endangered species the best care possible, particularly rehabilitating animals which will be released back to the wild. If the GI microbiome is “primed” to digest seafood and not plants, green turtles may not acquire nutrients from their natural diet as efficiently. Knowledge of the ways in which the microbiome responds to diet, as shown in this study, are critical, so that individuals can be released in the best health possible to give them the optimum probability of survival.']"

However, recovery kinetics varied between diets, i.e. the whey diet promoting a faster recovery of isometric force and concentric power output as compared to the casein diet. These effects were more specifically observed at force level and movement velocities that are relevant for functional abilities, and thus natural locomotion, in this animal model. Further studies should evaluate the efficacy of whey supplementation in human subjects. If the same conclusions are drawn, the whey diet may be particularly recommended for rehabilitation, in particular in older patients, who are at risk of hypoactivity, and have a reduced ability to recover muscle mass after immobilization periods.']"

2015-07-08T00:00:00Z,Maternal Plane of Nutrition during Late Gestation and Weaning Age Alter Angus × Simmental Offspring Longissimus Muscle Transcriptome and Intramuscular Fat,"['Cow plane of nutrition during the last 105 days of gestation resulted in modest changes in the offspring longissimus muscle transcriptome. Among these genes the bioinformatics analysis revealed an inflammatory process in offspring born from cows with access to higher plane of nutrition. The greater intramuscular lipogenic response in those steers contributed to the effect. Irrespective of maternal nutrition, early weaning induced a robust activation of the lipogenic program accompanied by activation of the innate immune system. The latter also was related to the greater lipogenesis during the growing phase. Subsequently, during the finishing phase, alterations of genes in the Golgi complex organization suggest an inhibition of lipid droplet formation potentially diminishing intramuscular fat accumulation in the steers.When only genes affected by weaning age are considered, the inflammatory response detected at the end of the growing phase in early-weaned steers was similar to that observed when evaluating DEG affected by cow plane of nutrition; in that case with signs of adipose tissue inflammation for both, MPN and LPN steers. These mechanisms were more pronounced in early-weaned steers from cows fed low plane of nutrition probably because of the lower intramuscular fat (marbling) scores. Overall, results from this work underscore the need to conduct further studies to understand better the functional outcome of the transcriptome changes. Additional knowledge on molecular and functional outcomes induced by the combination of prenatal and postnatal nutritional management would help produce more efficient beef cattle and higher quality beef.']"

The CN fed rats were more active in a Y maze test than rats fed the control and HF/HFr diets. The HF/HFr diet fed rats showed greater anxiety in an elevated plus maze test that was lessened by feeding CN. In conclusion, the negative effects of a HF/HFr diet on brain insulin signaling and behavior were alleviated by CN suggesting neuroprotective effects of CN associated with whole body improved insulin sensitivity and related changes in the brain. The consumption of foods or diets that lead to decreased insulin sensitivity may lead not only to changes in insulin related variables but also possible early changes in behavior that can be prevented or alleviated by CN. Additional studies are needed to further characterize the proteins and metabolites associated with these changes. ']"

Three diet categories were proposed: frugivore”, “folivore”, and “hard object feeder”.\nWhen controlling for sample size and phylogenetic effects, M1 SQ most accurately allocates individual specimens and species to the dietary categories “frugivore”, “folivore”, and “hard object feeder”. First molar RFI and OR, are less successful in DFA analyses. We interpret this result as stemming from the fact that RFI and OR incorporate added functional elements of tooth design, such as those that prolong functional lifespan in the face of enamel wear (e.g., crown height), or protect the gingival and reduce the likelihood that teeth will fracture (cingulum development). These added elements might not correspond to the immediate functional aspects of mechanical preparation—breaking up food so as to increase its surface area and speed digestive processes by enzyme and microbial action.\nUpper first molar indices, particularly SQ, also contain significant dietary information. However, the accuracy of the assignment of individuals or species to diet categories is poorer in general than accuracy achieved by corresponding measures on the lower molars.\nWhen both upper and lower indices are considered together with tooth length, we achieve a 93% success rate in allocation of individuals to three-diet category scheme and 92.2% to the four-diet scheme. Species are correctly allocated to diet groups 100% of the time.\nThe results of this study open the way for improved accuracy in inferring the diets of extinct platyrrhines for which both upper and lower molars are available, or, for taxa known only from upper molars. As well, it offers a new window into the dietary behavior of Eocene and Oligocene stem anthropoids and early catarrhines.\n']"

Encouraging local tiendas to label nutrient-rich foods to promote the individual purchase of healthy foods by community members, is another feasible option. Additionally, promoting government assistance programs like Prospera in the community and implementing additional programs designed to improve nutrition and health literacy, in conjunction with ensuring access to nutritious foods, might serve as an additional mechanism to decrease the high prevalence nutritional anemia within the community. Evidence illustrates that reducing anemia prevalence rates among community members will require a multifaceted approach involving both individual and community aspects.']"

Grazing also affected herbage performance, in that herbage biomass decreased and herbage nutritive values increased with increasing stocking rate. The increase in herbage nutritive values by grazing could not compensate for the decrease in herbage biomass. Both precipitation and stocking rate were important factors in determining livestock LG. We conclude from our results that a moderate stocking rate of 1 yak ha-1, which provides 88% of the highest LG per ha, satisfies the demands for sustainable grazing management. However, other more developed grazing management strategies, such as rotation grazing, supplementary feeding in winter and yak turn over period from 4 years to 2 years, may also increase the biomass and nutritive value of herbage and animal LG in the winter. Implementation of such strategies may improve the sustainability of grassland use on the other parts of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau with the similar conditions.']"

In this context, especially where health services are often facility-based, optimal use of nutrition interventions and services is critical to ensuring impact. It is, therefore, important to understand and address the factors influencing utilization in order to ensure that beneficiaries receive the full range of nutrition services and maximize their benefits. We have provided a comprehensive investigation of demand- and supply-side factors that influence utilization, focusing on the full range of utilization patterns–from one-time use to repeated use and ultimately achievement of the minimum package of services. Demand-generation strategies and counselling skills were the most important factors associated with any service use; strengthening these two demand -and supply-side factors could markedly improve service utilization with an additional 49% of the population achieving the recommended minimum number of MTBT visits. Given the continued efforts to improve the impact of IYCF interventions and to scale up nutrition through health systems globally, our study contributes robust empirical evidence on potential factors to optimizing facility-based counselling service utilization in Viet Nam.

However, SMF and UMF were far less damaged in the same rats. The phenomenon that the high energy diets only induce mechanical, but not thermal, pain hypersensitivity may reflect a selective damage to LMF, but not to the SMF and UMF. Moreover, dietary sodium (high-salt) deteriorates the neuropathic pathological process induced by high energy diets further, but paradoxically high salt consumption may improve, at least temporarily, chronic pain perception in these animals.We have therefore established a strong link between high-energy/high-salt diet induced metabolic syndrome and prediabetes which results in relatively selective LMF damage in both the PNS and CNS that in turn can result in neuropathic pain. These results have a profound impact on patient welfare relative to diet choice, not just for T2DM onset, but also for its associated neuropathic symptoms.']"

Our results showed that fish species from the PRE were generally characterized by high contents of SFAs and low contents of PUFAs, which might be related to the dietary increase of diatoms and the decline of dinoflagellate during the past several decades. PUFAs, especially n-6 PUFAs, in the studied species showed a significantly negative relationship with their trophic levels, presumably because the low trophic level of fish primarily fed on phytoplankton which were rich in PUFAs. The study indicated that there were considerable variations in the lipid nutrition in examined fish species from the PRE. Among them, Collichthys lucidus, Ilisha elongata, Trypauchen vagina, Odontamblyopus rubicundus and Sillago sihama, which contain better nutritional values in terms of P/S ratio, IA, IT, and HH than others, may be more suitable for people who prefer to consume PUFAs-rich fish from this region. In perspective of cardiovascular disease prevention, some fish species, especially those categorized in group 1, from the PRE might have no significant contribution for this purposes due to their poor lipid nutrition quality indices. However, it should be noted that the nutritional benefits of fish stem not only from their fatty acid profiles, but also from the richness in essential and nutritious compounds (e.g., easily digestible proteins, vitamins and polysaccharides). Furthermore, other than cardiovascular disease prevention, variety of additional health-promoting properties might also be highly related with fish consumption. Therefore, further studies are needed in order to make a comprehensive evaluation of the nutritional qualities of the fish species from the PRE.']"

2014-03-17T00:00:00Z,Preferences for Salty and Sweet Tastes Are Elevated and Related to Each Other during Childhood,"[""Because children naturally prefer higher levels of sweet and salty tastes than do adults, they are vulnerable to the modern diet, which differs from the diet of our past, when salt and sugars were once rare and expensive commodities. Having children eat diets low in sodium and added sugars requires a social, political, and economic food environment that supports and promotes this behavior change [43]. The present findings reveal that the struggle parents have in modifying their children's diets to comply with recommendations from medical authorities appears to also have a biological basis. Understanding the basic biology that drives the hedonic dimension of sweet and salty taste in children not only illustrates their vulnerability to the current food environment but also paves the way toward developing more insightful and informed strategies for promoting healthy eating that meet the particular needs of growing children.""]"
2017-02-17T00:00:00Z,Energy intake and energy expenditure of pre-professional female contemporary dancers,"['To conclude this research demonstrates that, as with many athletes in aesthetic or weight dependent sports, female contemporary dancers are at risk of energy deficiency, particularly during periods of scheduled dance training. As a result, this population could be susceptible to the numerous health and performance impairments associated with energy imbalance. In addition appropriate macronutrient intakes are essential for maintaining the demands of training, performance and recovery. The suboptimal macronutrient intakes observed in this study suggest a lack of knowledge regarding appropriate nutrition for sport and exercise performance. It is evident that dance populations would benefit from further research in order to develop current understanding of dance specific nutrition. For instance the variability of nutritional intakes and energy expenditures between term time and off-season remain to be investigated, and whether the negative energy balance reported in the current study is maintained in the long-term. Moreover it may be prudent to investigate nutritional strategies and the use of ergogenic aids which may provide practical solutions to improve energy balance and perhaps contribute to enhancing performance and recovery.']"

Asian region (combined data for the sites in India and Pakistan) provide further confirmation of the high incidence of stunting, wasting, low birth weight, and SGA in this region. Commencing a relatively comprehensive nutrition supplement at least three months prior to conception for women unselected for anthropometric indicators of nutritional status was associated with decreases of 44% in stunting, 24% in wasting, and 26% SGA when compared to the control group. These results provide quantitative information on the benefits to fetal growth achievable by improvement in intake of energy, protein, and micronutrients commencing before the start of the second trimester of gestation without any other interventions directed to improvement of the poor environments in which the participants lived. Furthermore, the relatively large point estimates for the effects of the nutrition supplement commenced ≥ 3 months prior to conception support enhanced efforts to improve the nutrition of all women of child-bearing age in resource-poor populations in these and similar environments in order to diminish impairment of fetal growth.']"

On the other hand, factors that were found to predict poor glyceamic control are highly modifiable (BMI, medication compliance, diet knowledge and skill score, intakes of milk and dairy products). This study provides an insight on glyceamic control among diabetic patients, which can be a good reference for future studies. It is believed that through appropriate strategies, the glyceamic control among the type 2 diabetics can be greatly improved.']"

Thus our 12 week diet enabled us to study the first few steps leading to T2D. Longer diet duration should lead to T2D. The originality of our model is the use of a fructose-enriched diet close to the actual consumption of young children. Further studies in this animal model should help to better understand metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes consequences and their prevention.']
2017-12-20T00:00:00Z,"Molecular analysis of stomach contents reveals important grass seeds in the winter diet of Baird's and Grasshopper sparrows, two declining grassland bird species","['Our results indicate which seeds are important for the winter diet of Baird’s and Grasshopper sparrows, despite the limitations mentioned above. This novel information provides a means to adequately assess habitat quality for wintering populations in Chihuahuan Desert grasslands. Although the diets consisted of a large variety of seeds, only a limited number of seeds was dominant. These seeds belonged to Panicoideae and Bouteloua spp. across sites and sampling periods, and Pleuraphis spp., Eragrostideae, Asteraceae, Verbena spp. and Amaranthus spp., depending on their availability. The dominance of Panicoideae and Bouteloua in the diets indicates the importance of perennial grasslands in the Chihuahuan Desert (usually dominated by species in these taxa) for the abundance and survival of overwintering Baird’s and Grasshopper sparrows, not only for shelter but also for food supply. We recommend promoting grassland management practices that maintain and restore native grassland species composition, for example by reducing grazing pressure during the growing season. Further research is necessary to determine exactly how management practices such as grazing intensity and timing affect seed production of preferred and dominant seeds in the diet, and how this affects Baird’s and Grasshopper sparrow wintering site selection and survival. It would furthermore be interesting to study the diet composition of these two birds in sites where Panicoideae are relatively absent and in sites with a higher degree of disturbance to gain more information on dietary flexibility in compromised situations. Finally, it is recommended that future molecular diet studies look for other DNA barcode regions such that seeds can be identified at a lower taxonomic level.']"
2019-04-26T00:00:00Z,Common garden experiment reveals altered nutritional values and DNA methylation profiles in micropropagated three elite Ghanaian sweet potato genotypes,"['Here we show that micropropagation reduces the nutritional value of sweet potato tubers and that micropropagated plants are both genetically and epigenetically dissimilar from field maintained plants. The higher levels of variability in the nutritional composition and of molecular diversity observed within micropropagated plants makes tempting the speculation that there is a direct relation between both. Regardless, the anonymous nature of the MSAP markers, used here to characterize somaclonal variation at a molecular level, does not allow us to asseverate that the detected DNA methylation polymorphisms are the drivers of the observed loss in nutritional value. Future studies should consider using a Next Generation Sequencing approach to identify those genes associated with the differentially methylated loci, as well as analyzing the gene transcriptional differences between field and in vitro maintained sweet potato tubers. Still, our results provide a useful start point from which to assemble a more comprehensive picture of the functional role of in vitro culture induced DNA methylation changes affecting the nutritional value of biofortified crops. More importantly, since future sweet potato biofortification plans include the use of in vitro culture to generate disease free propagules, our findings highlight the importance of including an assessment of the impact of micropropagation on nutritional values, with a special focus on beta-carotene content, of any novel biofortified sweet potato cultivar prior to their commercial release, to avoid the catastrophic costs to the industry previously seen with other in vitro propagated crops [50].']"
2017-02-09T00:00:00Z,Evaluation of the nutritional status of workers of transformation industries adherent to the Brazilian Workers’ Food Program. A comparative study,"['In conclusion, the results obtained in the present study, which assessed anthropometric measures of the nutritional status of workers benefited by the Workers’ Food Program, revealed statistically significant differences between mean BMI and waist circumference of the non-WFP and WFP group. One positive finding was the lower level of consumption of sodium and saturated fat among WFP workers, indicating a favorable association of the WFP with the nutritional intake of the population served by the program. Therefore, from a public health perspective, we believe that these results provide an important contribution by showing how an initiative by a central Government can contribute effectively to improving the nutritional status of a vulnerable population group in nutritional terms, without the need for the allocation, mobilization and direct application of national funds. In this sense, these results might encourage other countries, with similar population groups in vulnerable situations, to find in this model of public policy one way to combat the hunger and malnutrition, following the example of Brazil.On the other hand, our study also demonstrated, for the first time, a higher cardiovascular risk among WFP workers, as reflected by a larger waist circumference. Consequently, our results make a strong point toward the need of periodically revisiting the WFP and redefining its goals according to the changing nutritional status of the target population of the program, in order to help workers maintain a body weight within healthy limits.']"
2013-12-23T00:00:00Z,Nutritional Profile of Phytococktail from Trans-Himalayan Plants,"['To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt towards the determination of nutritional profile of the phytococktail developed from the native trans-Himalayan plants. Extensive characterization of water- and fat-soluble vitamins in the phytococktail was carried out with RRLC-tandem mass spectrometry. The proposed process was simple, low-cost and rapid, with high sensitivity, reproducibility, robustness and time-efficiency which can be useful in the determination of vitamins in a variety of food supplements, pharmaceutical preparations, fortified beverages and complicated food matrices. The free amino acid profile of the phytococktail revealed the presence of 8 essential amino acids that are important for human nutrition. The phytocoktail was also found to contain substantial amount of omega-7 MUFA (palmitoleic acid), omega-9 MUFA (oleic acid), SFA (palmitic acid) and small quantity of carboxylic acid (linoleic acid), suggesting that the phytococktail could become an important natural source of fatty acids suitable for health promotion and disease prevention. The phytococktail could thus be considered as a prospective functional food that may offer potential health benefits. The information of nutritional profile in the phytococktail holds great significance from both dietary and nutritional aspects of human in the extreme high altitude environment. Finally, it can be concluded that the phytococktail could be a high value nutritional phytofood as it contains multiple vitamins, essential amino acids, fatty acids and dietary minerals to provide great health benefit.']"
2017-10-26T00:00:00Z,Ethical issues in the development and implementation of nutrition-related public health policies and interventions: A scoping review,"['The results of this review illustrate the various natures, types, and scopes of existing (or planned) public health nutrition-related interventions, the widely differing contexts in which they are implemented, and the array of ethical issues that may arise. Ethical issues can only be addressed by taking into consideration the complexities of each specific setting. As a consequence, while general ethical frameworks or recommendations that follow from such consideration are certainly useful to draw attention to these issues, they cannot be expected to provide policy makers, implementors and other public health personnel with sufficient practical ethical guidance on how to achieve such goals in complex settings and specific public health nutrition interventions.This scoping review also illustrates the methodological challenges that must be faced when conducting such a review and constitutes a needed and useful step in the design and achievement of future research seeking to identify ethical issues that are raised by nutrition-related public health interventions and in the development of ethical frameworks for policy makers and health professionals. We suggest that, given the complexity and diverse natures of interventions and contexts in the field of public health nutrition, future reviews should focus solely on specific interventions, without limiting their search to articles or studies that explicitly address ethical issues. Every item in the sample of publications should then be reviewed and analyzed in order, first, to identify ethical issues, addressed or not and, second, potential gaps in existing recommendations and guidelines relating to that specific nutrition-related intervention.']"
2014-05-20T00:00:00Z,Poor Nutrition Status and Associated Feeding Practices among HIV-Positive Children in a Food Secure Region in Tanzania: A Call for Tailored Nutrition Training,"['In conclusion, HIV-positive children attending care and treatment centers in Tanga, a region with adequate food production, had poor nutrition statuses and low feeding frequency and dietary diversity scores. Low feeding frequency was associated with stunting, underweight, and thinness. Factors associated with low feeding frequency included low wealth index, low maternal or caregiver education, household food insecurity, and acute respiratory tract infections in the past six months.To ameliorate the high burden of undernutrition among HIV-positive children, feeding practices, in particular feeding frequency, should be improved even in areas where food production is high and food is available at low cost. To achieve this, more focused interventions may be necessary to help HIV-positive children in those households that face high food insecurity, poverty, and low education of caregivers. Nutrition training of health workers can help provide this support, reduce misconceptions regarding healthy foods [63], and help caregivers utilize efficiently and well the vast food availability in the region [3]. Nutrition counseling may also teach methods of food storage households who are affected by food insecurity but live in food rich regions [22]. Frequent nutrition counseling can help to guide such families into proper use of available resources including foods and give priorities to children with high nutritional demand.']"

2015-12-23T00:00:00Z,"Understanding the Rapid Reduction of Undernutrition in Nepal, 2001–2011","['This paper sought to understand rapid improvements in child nutrition in a remarkable success story. Despite large-scale conflict and political instability, Nepal achieved reduced stunting prevalence by 1.8 points per year from 2001 to 2011. Statistically, a number of factors convincingly account for this success.First, much of the improvement in child nutrition stems from improvements in birth size, with only a modest improvement in postnatal nutrition trajectories. Second, asset accumulation emerges as an important factor across all nutritional indicators. Interestingly, asset accumulation was very rapid, which is consistent with rapid growth in household income (S1 Text). Third, consistent with many other studies, educational improvements appear to be important. Specifically, though, we find only maternal education predicts improved child nutrition outcomes in Nepal. Fourth, revolutionary improvements in access to healthcare have played a large role in Nepal, with potentially important lessons for other developing countries. Major government programs have explicitly targeted ambitious improvements in antenatal, neonatal, and postnatal care through rapid expansion of health extension workers as well as financial incentives. Fifth, Nepal has achieved sizeable gains in sanitation, specifically in the reduction of open defecation. Indeed, it is possible that our model underestimates the contribution of improved sanitation because the DHS questions on toilet use do not identify when specific practices were adopted. Multi-country experimental evidence suggests that the impacts of toilet adoption are about twice as large as those estimated in this paper [30].The multi-dimensional and multi-sectoral nature of this change starkly emphasizes the point that rapid nutritional change seems chiefly to stem from simultaneous social and economic progress on multiple fronts [8–11; 31–32]. Indeed, our results for Nepal are strikingly similar to an analogous decomposition of nutritional change for Bangladesh [31], with the main except being a somewhat greater contribution of health services in Nepal. Together, these results suggest that emulating success stories requires overcoming some of the very challenging obstacles to achieving success on multiple fronts, including more effective inter-sectoral coordination.']"

In particular, we developed a Eurasian otter-specific blocking oligonucleotide (OBS1) for 12S rRNA gene sequencing for vertebrates. Overall, our study demonstrated that HTS-based DNA metabarcoding analyses were useful to provide in-depth information regarding their diet compositions. Our multi locus approach showed that the combination of 12S and 16S rRNA gene sequencing could cover a broad range of invertebrate and vertebrate prey animals of the Eurasian otters, including fishes detected by the COI gene sequencing. Our results suggest that the 12S and 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses suffice for diet analyses of the Eurasian otters, with optional COI gene sequencing for fish-specific detection and identification. In this study, spraint samples were collected at one location in one season, and the diet profiles might differ spatiotemporally [3, 4]. By using HTS-based metabarcoding analyses, future research will explore detailed taxonomies of the otters’ diets across locations and seasons.']"

2017-09-05T00:00:00Z,Can heat waves change the trophic role of the world’s most invasive crayfish? Diet shifts in Procambarus clarkii,"['Our results support those from other taxonomic groups, suggesting that temperature modulates the nutrient intake and the feeding preferences of omnivorous ectotherms, illustrating how these may develop under new climates. Given the positive effects on growth of the assimilation of plant material at higher temperatures, it is possible that diet regulation may help P. clarkii to cope with increased heat stress from longer heat waves in the future. While unlikely to boost P. clarkii’s Mediterranean populations, the changes projected in the severity, frequency and duration of heat waves may alter its trophic niche, especially in the juvenile stage, aggravating both its ecological impact on aquatic vegetation and economic damage to rice fields. This crayfish is known to act as a keystone species and changes in its functional role may echo through the whole food web, opening new trophic pathways or closing previously existing ones, possibly affecting its nutritional value to predators, its predatory impact upon macroinvertebrates and its grazing impact upon macrophytes [71]. Such modifications may even reshape the ecosystem function of the freshwaters inhabited by this alien invader, as macrophyte consumption by P. clarkii has been linked to shifts to alternative stable states with turbid water [72]. Finally, the tendencies in our results with P. clarkii suggest that the climatic changes projected for the near future may potentially drive significant changes in the most predominant impacts of other invasive alien species and warrants monitoring of the world’s ectothermic invaders and their consumptive impacts.']"

Exercise training can modulate the adverse metabolic phenotype induced by a high-fat diet, though the beneficial effects depend on the characteristics of exercise training. Importantly, HI training can improve the metabolic and corticosterone responses and adaptations. Compared to ME training, HI training more effectively reduced susceptibility to HFD-induced disorders. These adaptive changes to diet and exercise may be regulated via metabolism and the neuroendocrine system.

Reduced live performance in broilers from the B10-10 group was likely attributable to a non-adverse palatability effect of diets containing high metabolite concentrations; however, these subtle differences may suggest that an upper limit of tolerability is being approached. The weight of evidence from this evaluation suggests that consumption by poultry of diets containing butanol DDGS, heat-inactivated BMY, and associated fermentation metabolites presents a reasonable certainty of no harm under the anticipated conditions of use. Additionally, given the absence of published feeding trials using genetically engineered yeast, the protocol presented herein serves as a model for evaluating the safety of genetically engineered yeast in poultry.']"

These unacceptably high maternal malnutrition estimates in Africa stressed the need for priority interventions targeted to improve maternal nutrition during pregnancy. Investing on maternal malnutrition is also a key strategy to reduce LBW, PTB, and to break its inter-generational effect. Apart from socio-demographic and economic factors, maternal malnutrition has been affected by inadequate nutrient intake or poor nutritional indicators and multiple pregnancies.An optimal nutrient intake by the mothers is essential to meet both maternal and fetal requirements and reduce adverse health consequences in addition to spaced pregnancy. Although several nutritional intervention programs have been introduced to improve maternal nutrition globally and regionally, the problem has been increasing.

2017-01-03T00:00:00Z,Nutrition Smoothing: Can Proximity to Towns and Cities Protect Rural Children against Seasonal Variation in Agroclimatic Conditions at Birth?,"['This article exploits temporal and spatial differences in health risks to measure nutrition smoothing, defined here as the ability of a household or community to achieve similar outcomes for children exposed to different seasonal conditions. Our setting is the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), one of the world’s most impoverished countries whose vast expanse straddles the equator, exposing households to differing degrees of seasonal rainfall variation, and whose sparse urbanization and lack of infrastructure gives households very different distances to the nearest towns. In this context, we use naturally occurring randomness in the timing of conception and birth to construct a spatial difference-in-differences test of whether households with easier access to markets and public services can use that to protect their children from seasonal fluctuations in malnutrition and disease. Future work with other kinds of data could address which urban resources confer resilience to which seasonal risks.An important feature of DRC is that children’s average health is not necessarily worst where seasonal variation is most extreme. For example, being geographically isolated could actually benefit households and children, as isolation and rugged terrain may protect them from violence or disease outbreaks in more populated areas [65]. Furthermore, being located near the equator may provide relatively uniform weather which is beneficial for growing crops, but also impose worse disease conditions because there is no interruption to the reproductive cycle of mosquitos [66]. Our research design takes account of these factors, building on the literature described above to isolate seasonal fluctuations from other factors and test for a protective effect of proximity to towns. Distance to urban resources may help explain why we sometimes observe a limited influence of income or wealth on health and nutrition outcomes [67]. As shown in this study, variation in environmental factors over time as well as space plays a relatively large role in those settings than in places with greater access to markets and services. The lack of nutrition smoothing also contributes to the extremely poor average outcomes observed in the DRC [51, 68].Health outcomes in this study are child mortality, heights and weights at the time of the country’s 2007 and 2013 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). Our main result is that households’ proximity to towns and markets does protect children from seasonal fluctuations in health conditions at birth. For child height, the magnitude of gain from having above-median proximity to urban areas is similar in magnitude to the gain from being two quintiles higher in the local wealth distribution. Results of this magnitude are large but plausible, and help explain the rural-urban differences in health outcomes found in a wide variety of other settings. We subjected our findings to a variety of robustness tests, including comparisons of the estimated average treatment effect with similarly estimated coefficients in placebo regions and for placebo outcomes, selection bias in birth timing and child mortality, and other possible threats to identification.Further work such as [69] would be needed to distinguish among the possible causal mechanisms involved, for example to distinguish between the role of private markets and the use of public services, and to identify the role of particular aspects of seasonal variation in dietary intake or disease burdens. Incorporating data on the amenities available in different towns would help distinguish which ones contribute most to nutrition smoothing in surrounding areas. Different mechanisms may be protective against different shocks, but all rely on infrastructure to link rural households with towns and cities where goods are traded and services are provided. These results add a new dimension to the role of rural infrastructure and access to towns. Interventions to lower households’ travel costs could help reduce their vulnerability, in addition to the many well-known investments that target specific causes of malnutrition such as improved diets, health care and reduced disease transmission.']"

The diet composition comparisons based on NGS data were consistent with known foraging behaviours of the captured avian species. Additionally, the species-specific diet description at order and family levels using NGS is consistent with previous records based on traditional methods [23, 24, 49–51], thus reinforcing our results. Moreover, this study expands these records with a large number of arthropod families, genera and species previously unreported in the literature, particularly lepidopterans and dipterans, and especially in the case of those birds whose diet is understudied, such as G. palpebrosa, L. leucomela, and C. megarhyncha.The dietary analysis of the studied bird species is in accordance with the research previously published about their foraging behaviour. Because of their rich vegetation structure, remnant riparian habitats provide a wide range of foraging strata that maximise the bird guilds inhabiting them [86]. Guild-rich avian communities consume a diverse array of arthropods, which may translate into improved pest-reduction services in agricultural land, ultimately leading to bird conservation in those areas when the diverse vegetation structure is maintained.Overall, our study showed that NGS using the MiSeq Illumina platform and subsequent bioinformatics analyses offer a solid, relatively fast and recently increasingly affordable way to explore the diet of mixed-guild avian communities, delivering a wide scope and detailed resolution on the prey taxonomic level, which offers an opportunity to better understand their diet. Our results highlight the benefits that conserving birds foraging in orchards can bring to the macadamia industry and stress the need to protect the riparian habitats in this region to maintain avian richness.']"
2013-04-01T00:00:00Z,Unveiling the Diet of Elusive Rainforest Herbivores in Next Generation Sequencing Era? The Tapir as a Case Study,"['The DNA of plants found in the faeces is known to be highly degraded by digestion and we opted for using the short P6 loop of the plastid trnL intron associated to high throughput sequencing in order to maximise the chance to capture short plant DNA fragments in the faeces. This was successful since we could retrieve DNA from more than 50 different plants in every faecal sample. However, a major limitation to this approach is that the taxonomic resolution is mainly limited to the family or the genus, both because several species can have the same sequence and because the reference database are not yet complete. As long as the sequence reference database will not be taxonomically covered, the best taxa candidates can not all be interpreted as strictly confident records of the diet. We draw the attention of the reader that this approach, at this stage, only provides a list of hypothetical but likely plant taxa that can be eaten by tapirs.Nevertheless, our study case in the lowland tapir showed that the resulting information on the diet is well consistent with that from classical methods. It confirmed the consumption of many taxa, extended the range of use of some others and also allowed to discover new likely ones. Our study also showed that further development of the approach and refining of the taxonomical resolution is also possible thanks to the combination of complementary markers.The genetic reference databases are still under development, including DNA sequences from new organisms in new regions of the world (e.g. [57]). As more taxa are being sequenced a refined appreciation of the composition and richness of the diets should be possible.In the meantime, we feel that the metabarcoding of faecal DNA can already complement the classical approaches of the diet of tropical herbivores in a non-invasive way. Telemetry studies and analysis of the diet by stable isotopes can help focusing on the areas and habitats and large plant categories (e.g. [58], [59]) in which elusive rainforest mammals forage. If the fruit part of the diet can be well analysed up to the genus and species levels through macroscopic identification of the diasporas residuals in the faeces, the barcoding approach has the advantage to point to many likely taxa composing the less inventoried browsed part of the diet of the rainforest mammals. This can be up to 100% of the diet in tapirs during some periods of the year [18]). The barcoding approach can both extend and refine the list of items compared to classical visual histological approaches (see review in Yoccoz [60]). To date, the browse part in tapir diet has been investigated with best taxonomic resolution by the botanical analysis of browsing signs. Browsing signs can be attributed to tapirs thanks to their characteristic foot prints but in lighter animals not letting identifiable tracks around the found browsed plants, the identification of the browser may be more problematic. In certain cases, the plants may also have been browsed to such an extent that they are no more identifiable nor visible. The faecal DNA barcoding can interestingly complement the information on the taxa browsed by the rainforest animals.Hence it appears promising to identify key resources and associated habitats for endangered species, better characterize the dynamics of the resource partitioning in elusive herbivore communities, and more generally better appreciate the role of the herbivores in the functioning and the diversity of the rainforest ecosystem. However, we stress that similar tests using diet information from other approaches should be conducted in ruminants and fore-gut fermenters in which the digestive efficiency of fibres is different than in the hind-gut fermenter tapirs [13]. This could also be tested in other endangered groups of elusive species of the rainforest, such as primates and birds, in which information about the diet has been gathered through classic approaches [61] to extend it to groups in which information on the diet is still missing.\n        Data accessibility\n        Fasta files and filtered data have been deposited in the Dryad repository: doi: 10.5061/dryad.8h7k1.\n      ']"
2017-10-24T00:00:00Z,Demographics and practices of semi-intensive free-range farming systems in Australia with an outdoor stocking density of ≤1500 hens/hectare,"['This study was able to capture a previously undocumented section of the industry comprising of small to medium–scale farms that are not usually affiliated to any industry service body, but have emerged in big numbers across Australia and provide their products either through farmer’s markets or local stores. Although this study has attempted to document the practices, other studies are needed to conduct a census and record all enterprises that fall under this category. It is an important section of the industry and needs to be accounted for, to realise the full scope of egg production in Australia.Some of the unique characteristics of these semi-intensive free-range farms with an outdoor stocking density of ≤1500 birds/hectare include the presence of two types of housing systems, the fixed sheds and the mobile/caravan style housing. No scientifically validated research has been conducted to optimise the climate control, nesting and feeding in the mobile housing systems and to determine their effects on nutrition, health and welfare of birds. Range usage has been reported to be high in these systems with majority of birds accessing the range area and a large proportion of the outdoor range area being utilised. Dilution of allocated feed rations by elements consumed on range along with extra requirements due to temperature maintenance and increased physical activity need to be taken into account while formulating diets for free-range birds. High mortality rates have been attributed to predation, grass impaction, heat stress, disease and parasites, and smothering, all of which had been eradicated by introduction of intensive systems in the past but have re-emerged in these free-range systems. Adequate veterinarian support and training is a major requirement to manage and contain these conditions. Biosecurity could be improved on the farms with improved uptake of a number of actions by regular monitoring and dedicated workshops relevant to these systems. Management of manure and run-off needs to be put in place to prevent pollution of ground and surface water through leaching. Better legislation on planning of the farms is needed, to provide sustainable and environmentally conscious systems which account for welfare of birds. Overall a nation-wide training and support network consisting of experts on production and management, nutrition, health, welfare, environmental impact and biosecurity can help to sustain and expand these systems on a long term basis. Data and traceability for these farms is important to account for the total egg production statistics and to ensure health and welfare for all types of free-range enterprises in Australia.']"

We can thus conclude that the two lemming species on Bylot Island show high diet overlap during winter and consequently have a high potential for competition for food. However, this potential apparently does not translate into actual competition because their main food item, Salix, is abundant, lemming grazing has little impact on the vegetation, and the non-Salix portion of diets overlaps little between the species. It seems therefore unlikely that the species would suffer from strong food competition in the focal system. Our results highlight that even during the long high arctic winter, plant food resources—in relation to their use—may be abundant enough for herbivores to allow for high diet overlap. Moreover, our study underlines that in order to understand interspecific resource competition, it is important to assess how patterns of use and availability are related.']"
2014-06-02T00:00:00Z,The Gluconeogenesis Pathway Is Involved in Maintenance of Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 in Bovine Intestinal Content,"['Since environmental conditions direct the expression of suites of genes necessary for optimal bacterial growth, our data indicate that the utilization of gluconeogenic substrates may play an important role in the colonization of the bovine intestine by EHEC. Gluconeogenic substrates appear to be nitrogen sources (amino acids) and carbon sources (amino acids, glycerol, L-lactate). Accordingly, it is well documented that the GNG pathway contributes to bacterial fitness in vivo and is required by pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae during host infection [46], [47], [52], [53]. In particular, utilization of gluconeogenic substrates is required for a maximal colonization of the mouse intestine by EHEC [47].Significant levels of gluconeogenic substrates are likely present in the bovine intestinal environment. Lactate-producing bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Streptococcus or Succinivibrio sp. are part of the bovine intestinal microbiota and produce lactate (from carbohydrate fermentation) that can accumulate in the bovine intestine [54]. Aspartate and serine are abundant amino acids present in the mucus of the bovine small intestine [55] and may constitute direct sources of nutrients from the intestinal epithelium. Serine is also part of phosphatidylserine (a phospholipid present in the leaflet of prokaryote and eukaryote cell membranes) and may be released into BSIC from intestinal epithelium and cell debris from the endogenous microbiota. Glycerol is part of phospholipids (phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine) present in cell membranes and, like serine, is released into the BSIC during cell renewal. It is interesting to note that glycerol is used as a dietary supplement for cattle as i) a substitute for starch-based ingredients (such as corn), ii) energy supplementation, and iii) a preventive aid for metabolic problems (such as ketosis) [56], [57]. Glycerol is inexpensive and is currently abundant because it is a by-product of biodiesel fuel production. Consequently there is a renewed interest in incorporating this feedstock into ruminant diets. Interestingly, only 80% of the glycerol added to cattle diets is metabolized anaerobically by the ruminal microbiota [58], suggesting that part of the dietary glycerol can reach the small intestine.The genome-wide expression profiling described in this report highlights the capacity of EHEC to adapt to the bovine digestive environment and opens numerous new avenues for future investigations. In particular, defining the precise role of different gluconeogenic substrates during the growth of EHEC in the bovine intestine should enhance our understanding of their role in the physiology of these pathogens, and may assist us in discovering new nutritional or ecological strategies (for example the use of probiotics) to limit EHEC carriage by ruminants.']"
2018-04-26T00:00:00Z,Magnitude and determinants of inadequate third-trimester weight gain in rural Bangladesh,"['In this study of third-trimester weight gain among rural Bangladeshi women in Matlab, average weight gain was below the accepted national standard. More than half of the women had inadequate weight gain in the third trimester. The deficiencies in their overall health and nutritional status were corroborated by the high prevalence of stunting and anemia. Maternal characteristics such as short stature, low BMI, advanced age, parity, being Hindu, intake of arsenic-contaminated water, low level of education and socioeconomic status, and conceiving during monsoon or dry season were the risk factors for inadequate third-trimester weight gain.Particular attention should be given during prenatal care to women with the risk factors identified in this study. Short stature is an important determinant of poor weight gain during pregnancy, and as it indicates chronic malnutrition, nutrition during childhood and adolescence has to be focused in addition to prenatal nutrition. Prenatal nutritional intake should be improved. In addition to promoting female education, counseling for food taboos during pregnancy may be helpful. Arsenic mitigation should come to the forefront as intake of arsenic-contaminated water was found to be associated with low weight gain.']"

Our findings suggest that age is the factor most strongly associated with PUD in Korean adults, that obesity is associated with PUD, that the association between nutritional components and PUD is greater in women than in men, and that there are few relationships between blood parameters and PUD. In summary, our main findings are as follows. 1) Increased age was a strong risk factor for PUD in both Korean women and men. 2) In anthropometric indices related to obesity, decreased weight, BMI, and HipC values corresponded to an elevated risk of PUD in Korean women, and decreased HipC values corresponded to an increased risk of PUD in Korean men. 3) Regarding nutritional components, increased intake of dietary calcium decreased the risk of PUD in women, but not in men. Additionally, increased intake of dietary fiber, ash, sodium, and vitamin B2 decreased the risk of PUD in women. These results indicate that anthropometrics, lifestyle, and nutrition could play a significant role in PUD in Korean adults. Furthermore, the findings provide useful information for PUD screening tools and could improve public health efforts to address PUD.']"

Weight loss restores leptin sensitivity to some degree in most brain regions (but not all), while other brain regions display hypersensitivity to leptin following weight loss. In several brain regions, normal leptin responsivity was restored by weight loss, with the pattern of restoration dependent on the method of weight loss. Therefore, the effects of diet on leptin signaling in the brain vary by brain region, with the direction and magnitude by which diet affects leptin signaling dependent on the method of weight loss.']"

Issues such as lack of some micronutrients, which is highly prevalent in children, require policies that need to be pursued more seriously. Precise formulation and implementation of breastfeeding programs, complementary nutrition, and therapeutic supplementation for children, and fortification and sumpplementation for mothers should receive priority in this regard. The advantages and capabilities of each region are among the most important elements to be considered in policies. The use of ethnic and local foods in each region, correction of malnutrition, and promotion of nutritional literacy should be considered in different areas. Furthermore, given the fact that the policies of different organizations affect each other and lack of coordination between these policies may affect the success of the overall policies adopted, there is a strong need for more cooperation to materialize macro objectives.']"

During larval development, xylophagous beetles are confronted with a severe nutritional imbalance caused by poor digestibility of food and its stoichiometric mismatch with the beetles' bodies.2. These nutritional constraints are partly offset by the adjusted life histories of xylophages, with a development time extended to a couple of years. The life histories of dimorphic sexes and various species exploiting the same resources may differ, but computational simulations show that the prolongation of the development time is not sufficient to accumulate nutrients in adequate amounts.3. The nutritional balance of growing xylophagous larvae can be maintained due to the substantial enrichment of dead wood with nutrients imported from the outside by the mycelium of saprotrophic fungi.4. The fungal transfer of essential nutrients from the soil into the wood of dead trees is of fundamental importance for maintaining the detrital food web in forest ecosystems.""]"

2017-11-02T00:00:00Z,Younger age at diagnosis predisposes to mucosal recovery in celiac disease on a gluten-free diet: A meta-analysis,"['Despite the prescribed GFD, we found unexpectedly low complete mucosal recovery ratios (36%), even in patients being on a strict diet (47%). Disappearance of villous atrophy was more frequent (64%) than complete recovery, but far from 100% even in those following a strict diet (72%). These numbers emphasize the importance of performing a control biopsy in celiac patients to detect persisting histologic damage predisposing to several adverse outcomes (e.g., osteoporosis, malignancies).In a 12-month gluten-free diet, 38% and 54% of patients exhibited complete mucosal recovery and disappearance of villous atrophy, respectively. However, one year of diet might be insufficient to achieve mucosal recovery therefore biopsies should be taken later.Children show higher complete recovery (65%) and disappearance of villous atrophy ratios (74%) as compared to adults (24% and 58%, respectively), which was supported with regression analysis. Early diagnosis (therefore early initiation of the diet) can lead to higher mucosal recovery ratios; consequently, early diagnosis might help to reduce the frequency of adverse outcomes in the long run. This conclusion should be confirmed by prospective studies.We could not confirm the positive correlation between the length of GFD and mucosal recovery ratios either in the long run or between 9 months and about 2 years of diet. Accordingly, repeated control biopsies should not be taken from asymptomatic patients compliant with the diet to monitor mucosal recovery because results do not imply further histological improvement after several years of GFD.Regression analysis revealed that more severe diagnostic histologic damage and female gender is closely associated with low mucosal recovery ratios. These risk groups might require stricter follow-up and GFD.Given the considerable heterogeneity of the included studies, we would like to encourage the authors to follow the standard endoscopic and histologic procedures when conducting research in the field.Our results might contribute to the identification of those subjects who would benefit from a control biopsy. Well-designed, controlled studies with large sample size are needed to validate our findings and discover further associations.']"
2015-05-20T00:00:00Z,Investment in Constitutive Immune Function by North American Elk Experimentally Maintained at Two Different Population Densities,"['Comparisons of elk in high- and low-density populations indicated that as population density of elk increased, nutritional condition declined and individuals increased investment in constitutive immune function. Differences between individuals from different densities could have resulted because individuals in poor nutritional condition invested more in constitutive immune defenses, or because individuals from high-population densities had higher parasite loads causing induced immune responses. When considering differences in immune function and nutritional condition between individuals from different population densities and different age classes, our results provide stronger support for the hypothesis that animals in poorer nutritional condition invest more in constitutive immune defenses than animals in better nutritional condition. This strategy might allow elk in poorer condition to prevent the establishment of an infection and to avoid having to mount expensive adaptive immune responses. This intriguing hypothesis should be investigated further within the larger framework of the costs and benefits of immune responses.Our results also speak to the effects of density dependence on individual-level traits. Density-dependent mechanisms are mediated through intraspecific competition, via per capita availability of food and the subsequent influence of nutrition on reproduction and recruitment of young into the reproductive segment of the population [17–20]. As populations approach carrying capacity and resources become increasingly limited, some individuals do not gain adequate fat levels for both survival and reproduction; as a result, limited fat stores are allocated to survival over reproduction in slow-paced species, including elk [22, 42, 93–96]. Elk from the high-density population invested more in immune function than those from the low-density population, supporting our hypothesis that immune function is a trait that is mediated by population density. Our results support the premise that density-dependent regulation of immune function is important for understanding population demographics of species that show strong density dependence in their life histories.']"

Largest differences in chyme characteristics between diets were observed in the stomach and decreased towards the distal GIT. A high osmotic pressure in the stomach was detected for both diets and is suggested to drive the addition of endogenous water to the chyme. Large additions of water were observed in the stomach and proximal intestine for both diets, while absorption of water took place in the mid and distal intestine. Water balance in the GIT was altered by the consumption of the two experimental diets and present results suggest that the isoenergetic replacement of fat by starch induced a shift in water secretion from the proximal intestine to the stomach. Nevertheless, the overall addition of water to the GIT was not affected by the dietary treatment. For future studies on water fluxes in the GIT of fish, it is recommended to perform feeding trials with a combination of inert markers, as applied by other authors.

2019-12-19T00:00:00Z,Maternal employment and child nutritional status in Uganda,"['In Uganda, maternal employment is a significant determinant of child nutritional status. Other significant determinants are region, maternal age and education, and child’s age and weight at birth. The most vulnerable children are those whose mothers belong to the low socioeconomic status, are young, reside in places that are food insecure and have low levels of education.Interventions to increase maternal labour force participation should advocate for flexible work schedules—so that mothers can either leave work earlier or report later to involve in childcare. This is likely to support exclusive and continued breastfeeding, and consequently improve retention of women in employment. Interventions to improve the socioeconomic situation and nutrition of the population should target Northern Uganda in order to neutralize the palpable effects of the war. The study underscores the importance of education in improving the lives of individuals and their children. Efforts towards ANC and skilled delivery should place more emphasis on nutrition education in the antenatal and postnatal periods, to sensitize mothers about the benefits and dietary content of proper child and maternal feeding, and mosquito net use to prevent malaria. These interventions should have special focus on young mothers. Further research is needed to explain the reasons for the poor nutritional indicators among these categories in Uganda.']"
2019-09-06T00:00:00Z,Gender effects of agricultural cropping work and nutrition status in Tanzania,"['Our results show that time spent in farm work is negatively correlated with nutritional status for non-overweight individuals, albeit of small magnitude. This implies that agricultural interventions should not ignore the implications of work intensities on nutrition. The improvement in nutrition from increased agricultural production may be offset by the increase in work effort required by agricultural work.Unfortunately, there are few datasets that contain information on labor inputs, other agricultural inputs, production, and nutrition of household members. In order to empirically test the six pathways outlined in the agriculture-nutrition pathways [3], it is recommended that agricultural datasets include information on nutrition, and that production data contain information on agricultural inputs, including labor.The BMI of farmers with certain agricultural equipment (such as a seed planter, hand-powered sprayer) decreased at a faster pace with time spent in crop production. However, while the BMI of male farmers with tractors had a positive correlation with time spent in land preparation and planting, it was negatively correlated with time spent harvesting. It is possible that access to machineries reduced effort for one production activity, but increased work for other activities in the production process, such as in harvesting. The BMI of women in households with hand powered sprayer is positively related to time spent in weeding, fertilizing, and non-harvest activities, while it is negatively correlated for men. Our results suggest that access to hand powered sprayer may have helped reduce women’s work in weeding, while this was not the case for men’s work in ridging and fertilizing but further disaggregation of activities in the dataset would have been helpful to understand this better.Increasing women and men’s access to mechanized farming tools could reduce women’s energy exertion and improve their nutritional status. But it is important to consider the impact it could have on time and energy costs of not just one production activity but of other activities. The introduction of new equipment should also account for the physical differences between women and men, and its implications on work burdens. For example, ergonomically-designed equipment catering to the women’s needs can reduce their workload and improve productivity [41]. When new technologies are introduced, men might take over the tasks previously assigned to women [25]. It is imperative to ensure that women do not lose control over the proceeds of the agricultural products they were previously responsible for. Further, mechanization could displace farmers who are poor and low skilled and consequently reducing their incomes and nutritional status.Further research on efficiently measuring energy requirements, especially in large surveys in developing countries, will add to the growing evidence base on this topic. Measuring the intensity, duration, and frequency of time use for different activities, in addition to individual-level food consumption, will be key to accurately capturing energy expenditure [42].']"

Child and maternal health and nutrition-related indicators has been improved over past few decades. The study summarizes that maternal mortality ratio (MMR), under-five mortality rate and neonatal mortality rate shows declining trend in Bangladesh. The current trend and future prediction of these indicators considered in this study support satisfactory development and on a track to reach national target of Bangladesh 2021. Further, more initiatives need to achieve related SDGs 2030.In spite of gaining a remarkable change in different public health indicators in Bangladesh, malnutrition is still a concerning issue for us. This study observed a decreasing trend in prevalence of stunting in Bangladesh, while and prevalence of wasting in recent years is increasing. The predicted percentage of stunting is higher than the national target-2021. Eventually if we do not take necessary steps, we will not be able to reach SDG target 2.2 about malnutrition. Assuring a sound maternal and child health of a country is essential for sound public health status of the country. Reductions in stunting and other forms of under nutrition can be achieved through proven interventions which include improving women’s nutrition, especially before, during and after pregnancy; early and exclusive breastfeeding; timely, safe, appropriate and high-quality complementary food; and appropriate micronutrient interventions. Progress on child and maternal nutrition is needed to reduce high levels of under nutrition on child survival, growth and development.In this study, maternal and child health indictors are analyzed.

2016-05-13T00:00:00Z,Seasonal Variation of Harbor Seal's Diet from the Wadden Sea in Relation to Prey Availability,"['In this study, we observed resource changes and spatial changes. Indeed, a higher influence of pelagic food resources is evident in the harbor seal’s diet in spring whereas the diet is dominated by benthic food resources in summer, fall and winter. Furthermore, harbor seals might use more food resources of the Sylt-Rømø Bight in spring and summer compared to fall and winter when the biomass of prey items is relatively low. Thus, the Sylt-Rømø Bight has an important role as a foraging area for harbor seals in addition to its function as a resting and nursery area. The use of the Bight as a foraging area by a large colony of harbor seals might have a seasonal and relatively strong influence on the food web of the Sylt-Rømø Bight, particularly in spring and summer, when the seal abundance and the contribution of Sylt-Rømø Bight food resources to their diet are highest.These results also highlight the necessity of much more detailed studies about temporal and spatial variations of marine mammal diets. For example, a potential competition of seals with fisheries for commercial species might strongly depend on seasons and location. Vibrissae can be used as very good recorders in marine mammal trophodynamics. Therefore, additional studies on growth rate of vibrissae are needed to precise the correspondence between the vibrissae length and the time scale. Furthermore, the combination of diet studies based on trophic markers such as stable isotopes with telemetry survey would be very valuable for management issues about highly mobile species such as harbor seals.']"
2017-07-19T00:00:00Z,Integrative functional analyses using rainbow trout selected for tolerance to plant diets reveal nutrigenomic signatures for soy utilization without the concurrence of enteritis,"['The reformulation of aquafeeds along with the advancement of breeding programs with species adaptive to replacement diets is crucial to the success of sustainable aquaculture. After over a decade of genetic selection, we developed a strain of rainbow trout that performs well over long-term rearing when fed a high-soy, all plant-protein feed without developing enteritis. Since growth and feed efficiency along with diet-tolerance were major selection foci, we examined gene expression by RNA sequencing muscle and liver tissues of selected and non-selected trout strains fed either a fishmeal-based control feed or an all plant-protein feed. Genes identified in this study can be added to the growing list of those associated with diet tolerance and utilization. Among the tissues and strains, thiamine and especially purine metabolism is highly perturbed. Systems analysis among the tissues tested reveals that the interplay between selection for growth, dietary utilization and tolerance may have implications in nonspecific immunity as well. Using an integrative nutrigenomic approach of read-count differential expression, co-expression and other functional analyses, candidate genes that may play major roles in plant-diet utilization were found as these genes were identified in fish in the absence of enteritis. In addition, a major risk locus in ulcerative colitis, IL17REL was identified through these efforts and expression of IL-17 has been indicated in ulcerative colitis and celiac disease; as such, rainbow trout selected for plant-diet tolerance may have added utility as a potential biomedical model for human inflammatory bowel diseases.']"
2015-07-17T00:00:00Z,Prenatal Iron Deficiency in Guinea Pigs Increases Locomotor Activity but Does Not Influence Learning and Memory,"['The current study emphasizes the need for replication, as recently highlighted by several authors, such as Yong [75], Russell [76], Cesario [77] and Simons [78]. The results of our previous study were controversial with the literature, stating that prenatal IDA produces an increase in exploratory behaviour in guinea pig offspring instead of the much-observed decrease [32, 36, 38, 44] and that there were no visible effects on learning or memory, whereas many had seen deficits [23, 38–40]. However, the current study, by using more precise tools (video tracking systems and behavioural analysis softwares) and analyzing additional variables, supports and refines our previous conclusion. In addition to elevated activity levels in the OFTs (although solely on PNd40) and no effects within the MWM, our pups from the IDA group presented particularly low survival rates, as in Fu et al. [30]. The practice of replicating the previous study has also brought forth several hypotheses as to the cause of this increase in activity, mainly that prenatal IDA provoked augmented anxiety, and that these effects may emerge later in life. As for the lack of effect on learning and memory processes, one could argue that the IDA diet was relatively moderate and that a highly IDA diet could result in significant effects. However, given the high mortality rate associated with the IDA diet in this study, we do not ethically support this idea. In addition, our research was aimed at mimicking the IDA diet consumed by pregnant North American women, which is known for being moderately IDA [79], and it would be inappropriate to develop an animal model based on a highly IDA diet.']"

2018-03-06T00:00:00Z,Next generation sequencing for gut microbiome characterization in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fed animal by-product meals as an alternative to fishmeal protein sources,"['In summary, taken together, our data revealed that animal by-product meals, particularly PBM, could be a valid alternative protein source for aquafeed production. These ingredients do not negatively affect fish growth performances, but rather could reduce the negative impacts of high inclusion rates of dietary plant proteins on fish growth. Adding PBM to trout diet introduced no changes in the total microbial diversity or richness. Changes to the intestinal microbiome composition that we found were actually due to the ratio between vegetable and animal proteins regardless of the animal proteins sources. In particular, intestinal abundance of specific taxa belonging to Firmicutes and Proteobacteria was discriminatory for diet type in trout. Among tested diets, formulation D provided the best results in terms of percentage of FM replacement, growth performance, and intestinal microbiota composition, whereas experimental feed B and commercial feed G had an adverse effect on the gut microbial community by reducing the abundance of Lactobacillales. By manipulating fish diet, it is possible to obtain positive effects on the composition of gut microbiota and, hence, on the host’s physiology. However, further experiments are needed to elucidate which are the feed ingredients that have the highest impact on the gut microbiota changes.']"

The empirically determined isotopic incorporation rates of N. bredini’s hemolymph and muscle will allow for determining diet assimilated over temporal scales of days and months, respectively. The discrimination factors will be integral to estimating the contribution of different prey to the diet. This information will be critical for determining the trophic ecology of many marine ecosystems.More broadly, to our knowledge, this study is among the first to examine the incorporation rates and discrimination factors of multiple crustacean tissues. Our results revealed a possible trend in crustacean tissues that Δ13C is around 3‰, as opposed to 0–1‰ observed in many taxa [28]. We also demonstrated that the time points of diet assimilation represented by the muscle and hemolymph incorporation rates counter findings in rock lobsters, and instead align more closely with vertebrates. Finally, we provide evidence that there might be a general relationship between incorporation rate and body size that spans many animal taxa. Future studies examining this relationship across animals would be an integral contribution of the field of stable isotope ecology.']"
2017-04-17T00:00:00Z,Enhanced offspring predisposition to steatohepatitis with maternal high-fat diet is associated with epigenetic and microbiome alterations,"['We have demonstrated that maternal HFD alters the response to post-weaning HFD in the offspring including hyper-responsiveness in weight gain and fatty liver associated with obesity. Offspring from HFD-dams develop unique transcriptomic changes especially in response to post-weaning HFD, typified by greater hepatic immune response. Maternal HFD-induced alterations are associated with increased expression of classic pro-fibrogenic genes in the liver following MCD diets. Consistent with the premise that in utero programming leads to epigenetic changes, offspring of HFD-dams show alterations in DNA methylation of predominantly development-related genes. Further, previously unrecognized epigenetic changes associated with MCD diet exposure in the liver were identified, including hypomethylation of key regulators of cell adhesion. Finally, these studies identified novel changes in the richness and abundance of specific bacterial taxa associated with maternal diet. Changes in gut bacteria were influenced further by offspring MCD diet and correlated with extent of liver injury and alterations in microbial genes regulating bacterial invasion and toxins. These results suggest that maternal HFD and obesity are likely to predispose offspring to hepatic inflammation and fibrogenesis contributing to the pathogenesis of NASH.']"

Present results demonstrate that dietary changes have the potential to produce beef with enhanced levels of PUFA BH products. However, in order to produce beef with consistently increased levels of PUFAs, further knowledge regarding how the type of PUFA, composition of the non-oil fraction of the diet and the type and level of feed processing impact PUFA deposition in the subcutaneous fat is required. Optimizing ruminal outflows of BH products will also require a better understanding of the precise role of rumen microbes and how the individual animal's genetics contribute to inter-animal variation. While some bacterial genera in this experiment were found to be correlated to specific FAs, the effect of diet on lipolytic rumen microrganisms and preferential pathways for BH requires greater insight by combining molecular techniques with classical culture techniques. Bacterial genera positively correlated to increasing BH intermediates in the present experiment need to be further researched in order to confirm whether these correlations are consistent over a range of diet types.""]"

This suggests that, apart from being a marker of a healthy diet, plasma ascorbic acid may at least partly favorably influence blood pressure in itself, or mark something else that influences blood pressure, in addition to the dietary aspects assessed in the a priori diet quality score. Given the inverse associations seen for dietary vitamin C and several foods rich in vitamin C, but not for supplemental vitamin C, it seems that ascorbic acid status may best be improved by increasing dietary sources of vitamin C, in addition to not smoking and any other dietary sources low in vitamin C that prevent ascorbic acid from depletion.']"

Whereas diet stable isotope values can be easily determined in laboratory experiments, various indirect methods have been used in field studies resulting in great uncertainty in results [17]. Here we established a semi-direct compound specific method for deriving bulk δ13C values for phytoplankton, terrestrial matter and bacteria by determining lipid and fatty acid δ13C values and calculating the isotopic difference between lipids/fatty acids and bulk biomass.

Clearly, recommendations based upon definitive clinical outcomes would be far preferable, and are supported by the findings of this review, however the strength of conclusions should remain circumspect because of the weakness of the evidence base. It seems unlikely that clinicians and patients fully appreciate the limitations of the data and the extent of the uncertainty.

The loci affected in terms of gene expression and DNA methylation were quite different, probably reflecting different roles of these signatures. Whilst we noted some evidence that diet impacted upon expression and epigenetic regulation of Dnmts, inconsistency and subtle variations in the data suggest more intricate mechanisms are involved in the response to early diet. There was a significant overlap between loci affected in terms of DNA methylation in the model, with loci from GWAS studies for metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. Together these findings indicate that improved understanding of complex traits and diseases is likely to require further integration of human and animal studies, with amalgamation of genetic, epigenetic, and gene expression-based approaches.']"

Nonetheless, maternal consumption of the green tea extract induced a proinflammatory milieu in the adipose tissue of the adult offspring that received control diet after weaning showing that consumption of green tea extract is capable of altering the metabolic development of offspring by modifying metabolic programming.

2018-04-03T00:00:00Z,Digestive enzymes and gut morphometric parameters of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus): Influence of body size and temperature,"['To our knowledge, this study is the first to characterize the digestive activity of G. aculeatus by focusing on three digestive enzymes (amylase, IAP, and trypsin) and three gut morphometric parameters (RGM, RGL, and ZI). Sticklebacks were fed exclusively with frozen chironomid larvae, with constant protein, fat and fiber composition. We chose to control the diet parameter, in order to study the effect of other factors (i.e. size, sex and temperature) on the digestive parameters. In these fixed nutritional conditions, sticklebacks exhibited higher amylase than trypsin activity in both experiments, characterizing an omnivorous fish, which is in accordance to feeding habits of this species, defined by others parameters (stomach contents) in the literature. When considering gut morphometric parameters, RGL and ZI failed to categorize sticklebacks according to their feeding habits, probably due to the lack of dietary diversity.Our study showed no size effect, but a temporal variation of the three digestive enzymes was observed when temperature was progressively modulated to mimic seasonal variation. The activity of the three digestive enzymes was higher in hot periods (with a long photoperiod) and lower in cold days (with a short photoperiod). The highest levels of amylase and trypsin activity were observed at 18°C, while the highest IAP activity level was recorded at 20°C. When sticklebacks were exposed to three constant temperatures (16, 18, or 21°C), no differences were observed among groups, but a significant temporal effect was observed, with inverse evolution of the patterns between amylase activity and the activity of the other two digestive enzymes. The temporal effect on digestive enzymes was correlated with the effect of temperature on fish growth. Cool temperatures (16 and 18°C) favored a high growth rate (based on body mass evolution), while a temperature of 21°C limited growth efficiency even with a daily ad libitum diet. The results of this study suggest that in the context of global warming long exposure to a high water temperature (21°C) could compromise stickleback physiology by affecting their growth. Altered growth parameters (weight and size) were correlated to a decrease in trypsin activity and suggest that this enzyme could be used as a marker of thermal stress in the threespine stickleback.While keeping in mind the specific experimental conditions of this study (calibrated undiversified food ration), these findings can be used to supplement existing data on the digestive process and energy metabolism of threespine sticklebacks. The absence of body size effects on digestive enzyme activity and the response of digestive enzymes to temperature changes can be considered as interesting results for possible use in an ecotoxicological context.']"
2019-03-14T00:00:00Z,"Apple consumption is associated with a distinctive microbiota, proteomics and metabolomics profile in the gut of Dawley Sprague rats fed a high-fat diet","['This work adds valuable information to the literature but there are a number of pitfalls that are important to discuss in order to guide future investigations on the effect of apple supplementation on the gut microbiota and overall health. First, there is great variation in nutritional content (e.g. fiber and pectin concentrations) among different apple cultivars and also between ripeness stages and here we only studied the effect of granny apples at one fixed ripeness stage. Second, fibers and other dietary components affect the gut microbiota at the species level [45] but the 16S rDNA is not discriminative enough to reach the species level. This is important because the variation between subjects involves differences at the species or even at the strain level [46]. Third, the administration of specific bioactive compounds (as opposed to the whole fruit) may have a completely different effect in vitro and in vivo. For example, Masumoto et al. [4] showed that supplementation of non-absorbable procyanidins led to a decrease in the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio. Also, the intake of whole apples or clear apple juice has been shown to produce highly contrasting effects on plasma lipids in healthy volunteers [47]. Fourth, the use of sucrose to maintain isocaloric contents in the diets may by itself be responsible for alterations in the intestinal microbial ecosystem [48]. Finally, in this study we decided to include more animals in the HF group based on what is currently known in the literature, which could have been associated with the presence or lack thereof of treatment effect. However, we performed additional analyses using a subset of samples from the HF group and demonstrated that the observed effect of apple supplementation on the gut microbiota was still noticeable even when using as little as five randomly selected samples from each treatment group (see “Beta diversity analyses” above).In summary, this paper shows that apple consumption has the potential of helping patients with body weight disorders. This study shows that apple supplementation for six weeks has a measurable impact on the abundance of specific fecal bacterial groups in vivo, particularly in the presence of a high-fat diet. This change in composition was accompanied by a change in whole communities, biochemical and inflammatory biomarkers in plasma, fecal and host proteins in colon mucosa, as well as fecal metabolites other than SCFAs, which remained similar. These results suggest unique host response signatures driven in part by the differences in the microbiota colonization and contribute to the understanding of microbiome-host interactions with implications in health and diseases, but more studies are needed to explore different apple varieties at different ripeness stages since apple composition (metabolites, fiber, pectins, etc) will differ among cultivars and might influence differently human and animal health.']"
2019-12-16T00:00:00Z,"Effect of Iodine treatments on Ocimum basilicum L.: Biofortification, phenolics production and essential oil composition","['In our study, basil emerged as a good target for iodine biofortification, as the plant was able to efficiently uptake and translocate large amounts of the element, which were stored in the leaves in a dose-dependent manner. The higher assimilation rate of iodide comparing to iodate was confirmed in both the open field and the growth chamber trials, and, following the adopted biofortification protocol, the optimal concentrations to be used should range between 0.1 mM and 1 mM. At those values, the yield was not compromised and the iodine content in leaves fitted into the recommended daily intakes established for human beings, considering the low amount of basil leaves that can enter human diet either directly as a culinary herb or after processing.Plant nutritional value was positively affected by the iodine treatments, as an increase of leaf antioxidant power and phenolic compounds’ accumulation, especially RA and cinnamic acid, was observed in KI and KIO3 treated plants. Nevertheless, a substantial alteration of these nutraceuticals was obtained only with concentrations of the iodine salts between 1 and 10 mM, which in turn induced yield reduction, phytotoxicity symptoms and an excessive iodine accumulation. Administration of 1 mM KI could anyway represent a good compromise between the biofortification purpose and a moderate enrichment of antioxidant compounds in basil leaves.The EO composition was influenced by both iodine form treatments in a dose-dependent fashion in the growth chamber set-up, with large changes in the volatiles production and even shifts in the chemotype among the samples. On the contrary, the chemotype of the open field basil was not influenced at any treatment concentration and the differences that were registered among the treatments were subtle and could not alter the overall distribution of the main EOs fractions between control and iodine-treated plants.']"
2014-06-10T00:00:00Z,Integrative Analyses of Hepatic Differentially Expressed Genes and Blood Biomarkers during the Peripartal Period between Dairy Cows Overfed or Restricted-Fed Energy Prepartum,"['The use of additional blood biomarkers and novel bioinformatics tools for the analysis of published transcriptomics data provided a more holistic understanding of the role of plane of nutrition during late-pregnancy on hepatic adaptations around the period of parturition. An all-encompassing dynamic model using these data is reported in Figure 7. Overfeeding energy prepartum enhances body fat deposition, partly in response to chronic hyperinsulinemia, which leads to more pronounced and sustained increase in blood NEFA postpartum and greater TAG accumulation in liver at least in part by reducing lipid catabolism and partly due to “dampened” PPARα activation. Despite such response, in overfed cows there was an attempt to counterbalance these negative effects by reducing Notch signaling and activating other cellular pathways of which cell cycle and ECM receptor interaction would likely help the liver repair from cellular damage (suggested by higher blood bilirubin and, numerically, GGT). On the contrary, although cows fed restricted energy appeared to catabolize substantially more muscle mass prepartum, their liver was able to adapt to the higher postpartal metabolic state well-ahead of parturition. This adaptation was likely driven by molecular processes partly controlled by transcription regulators such as PPARA and NFE2L2, of importance in fatty acid oxidation and cellular stress. As a result, restricted-fed cows had signs of greater metabolic flux and utilization of amino acids and fatty acids but also of a more pronounced cellular inflammatory and ER-stress response. Most of those cellular adaptations were confirmed by biomarker analysis specifically during the prepartal period, which strengthened the notion that restricted-energy helped “prime” the liver to cope with the change in physiological state at the onset of lactation.10.1371/journal.pone.0099757.g007Figure 7\nAll-encompassing dynamic model proposed based on the main findings from the study.\nReported are differential effects of the diet prepartum on adipose tissue, muscle, and liver (depicted by yellow round cells, image of a muscle section, and draw of a stylized liver, respectively).

In the light-yellow background round shapes are reported main transcriptional factors potentially involved in controlling the transcriptomics adaptation of the indicated pathways. Summary explanation of the model is reported in the conclusion section of the paper.\nClearly, there is a carryover effect of plane of nutrition during late-pregnancy that will result in molecular and physiological adaptations during lactation. Our data support the view of a more robust liver in restricted-fed cows to face the metabolic and inflammatory challenges typical of the early postpartal period. As such, the transcriptomics data provide evidence that plane of dietary energy during late-pregnancy can help prime the liver for the onset of lactation.']"

Thus, picky children may develop a lower diet quality than non-picky children. Our results should be generalized with caution only, because of the selected study population, and because further studies are needed to confirm these findings.']"

2017-02-14T00:00:00Z,Effects of dietary nutrient levels on microbial community composition and diversity in the ileal contents of pregnant Huanjiang mini-pigs,"['The ileal bacterial profiles of Huanjiang mini-pigs were dominated primarily by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, and, in particular, representatives of the genera Lactobacillus, Clostridium, and Turicibacter. The effects of varying animal feed on the composition and diversity of the large intestinal microbiota also need to be elucidated, considering their potential importance. The HN diet was associated with a higher Lactobacillus abundance in pregnant Huanjiang mini-pigs. Since this diet differs from the LN diet in various characteristics (more digestible energy, higher relative protein content, and lower relative crude fiber content), it was not feasible in the current study to identify one particular dietary component associated with modifications in bacterial communities. In addition, the rice bran fiber and alfalfa used in both diets, but in inverse proportions, are characterized by different fiber type compositions [60,61]. Members of the phylum Firmicutes and genus Lactobacillus decreased, while those of the phylum Proteobacteria, family Enterobacteriaceae, and genus Bacteroides increased in number from day 45 to 75 of pregnancy. Notably, changes in bacterial community structure (e.g., increased number of Proteobacteria) as pregnancy progressed were similar to those observed in disease-associated dysbiosis (e.g., morbid obesity), indicating the need for further studies on a possible causal link between these parameters.']"
2018-12-13T00:00:00Z,Taurine deficiency and dilated cardiomyopathy in golden retrievers fed commercial diets,"['All dogs with DCM in this study were consuming diets with similar characteristics, including grain-free, uncommon protein based, or legume-rich formulations. We also noted that all but one of these dogs were consuming less food than their calculated MER would suggest and thus cannot exclude the role of dietary intake in these cases. In addition, we identified an increased prevalence of taurine deficiency in a sample of apparently healthy golden retrievers fed similar diets. Although a cause and effect relationship cannot be proven, the associations are concerning and warrant caution as well as future prospective studies. Assessment of taurine status of golden retrievers consuming similar diets may be indicated; however, adequate blood concentrations of taurine may be higher than previously recognized for some dogs. This data also underscores the immense value of obtaining complete diet histories in canine patients with cardiac disease.Future, controlled, prospective studies of larger sample size are needed to determine if the clear associations identified in this manuscript represent a cause-and-effect relationship between DCM, taurine-deficiency, specific ingredients, and grain-free food varieties in general. Without such studies we cannot conclusively define which dietary characteristics are involved with the pathogenesis of this condition.']"
2014-10-15T00:00:00Z,"Does the Method of Weight Loss Effect Long-Term Changes in Weight, Body Composition or Chronic Disease Risk Factors in Overweight or Obese Adults? A Systematic Review","['The present systematic review found limited evidence to suggest better long-term weight loss and more favorable long-term changes in body composition and chronic disease risk factors when diet is combined with aerobic exercise compared with either diet or aerobic exercise alone. However, no advantage for minimizing weight regain or changes in body composition or chronic disease risk factors following weight loss was shown for any weight loss mode. As previously discussed, the available literature on this topic is extremely limited and suffers numerous methodological shortcomings. Therefore, we recommend additional randomized trials to specifically evaluate the impact of mode of weight loss on changes in weight, body composition and chronic disease risk factors following both active weight loss and maintenance that include the following: 1) adequate statistical power to detect clinically significant differences in these outcomes both overall and by sex; 2) weight loss and maintenance phases of ≥6 months and ≥12 months, respectively; 3) supervised, verified exercise during weight loss of sufficient energy expenditure to achieve weight loss similar to that achieved in comparison groups (i.e. diet only or diet+exercise). 4) maintenance periods with and without prescribed exercise; and 5) resistance training.']"

2017-09-21T00:00:00Z,Supermarket purchase contributes to nutrition-related non-communicable diseases in urban Kenya,"['This study suggests that buying food in supermarkets increases BMI, fasting blood glucose, and the probability of being overweight/obese, pre-diabetic, and suffering from the metabolic syndrome. Since supermarket users consume larger quantities of highly processed and energy-dense foods, we reckon that the nutrition and health effects are mainly driven by supermarkets influencing people’s dietary choices. This would mean that the rapid spread of supermarkets in developing countries directly contributes to the nutrition transition. However, premature judgements should be avoided, as supermarkets can also have positive effects for public health and development. We have highlighted new aspects and dimensions of the effects of supermarkets on nutrition and health in developing countries. This is a new research direction where the available evidence is still relatively thin. Given the rapidly rising prevalence of NR-NCDs in many developing countries, more research on the role of changing food environments and appropriate policy responses that account for the complexity of effects will be needed.']"

2015-12-16T00:00:00Z,"Global Update and Trends of Hidden Hunger, 1995-2011: The Hidden Hunger Index","['Deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals–also termed hidden hunger–are pervasive, and continue to be largely hidden. The impact of hidden hunger holds significant and immediate negative consequences for the cognitive and physical development of children, as well as longer-lasting effects on productivity and economic potential in later adulthood. This time trend analysis of the hidden hunger index, a composite measure of three key micronutrient deficiencies, contributes to our global understanding of how hidden hunger has evolved over time both within individual countries and at the regional level, and how these trends compare to a number of other global indices presenting various aspects of hunger and nutrition. Both generate noteworthy results that can be used for evidence-informed decision and policy-making in the context of a growing interest in nutrition, and a parallel paucity of data on hidden hunger.In parallel, this analysis highlights an urgent need to invest in the updating of the VMNIS, so that it continues to gather frequent, nationally representative, high-quality micronutrient data for a large number of countries and for a wider range of micronutrients. Such data is critical to inform the policy and programmatic efforts needed to advance the global nutrition agenda, and to achieve MDGs 1, 4, and 5. Looking ahead, as we enter the post-2015 development agenda period and renew our efforts to scale-up nutrition, such a global micronutrient information system is critically important to provide the urgently needed data for monitoring and tracking progress in achieving the new sustainable development goals (SDGs).']"
2014-12-15T00:00:00Z,Nutrients Differentially Regulate Nucleobindin-2/Nesfatin-1 In Vitro in Cultured Stomach Ghrelinoma (MGN3-1) Cells and In Vivo in Male Mice,"['We provide the first set of information on nutrient regulation of nesfatin-1. Our findings suggest that the effects of diets on the expression of endogenous NUCB2/nesfatin-1 are myriad, with specific effects on mRNA expression versus secretion, in a dose and time dependent manner. We characterised MGN3-1 cells as nesfatin-1 secreting cells with the NUCB2 processing machinery, suggesting that this cell line is useful for studying nesfatin-1 biology. Glucose simulates NUCB2 mRNA expression in a dose and time–dependent manner in MGN3-1 cells. We also found that L-Tryptophan stimulates NUCB2 mRNA expression and nesfatin-1 secretion. From our in vivo studies, NUCB2 mRNA expression was significantly lower in the liver of mice fed on a high protein diet compared to mice fed other diets. High fat fed mice had a significant reduction in NUCB2 mRNA expression in the stomach, while high protein and high fat diet resulted in the attenuation of NUCB2 mRNA in the large intestine. Mice fed on the high protein, high carbohydrate and high fat demonstrated a post-prandial increase in NUCB2/nesfatin-1 secretion. Our results indicate that the synthesis and secretion of nesfatin-1 are altered by relative amount of nutrients and such effects are dependent on the amount of nutrients, tissues and time of the day or duration of treatment. While such variations exist, our data in general support that fat is inhibitory, while carbohydrate and protein are nesfatin-1 stimulatory. Nesfatin-1 is explored as an anti-obesity compound. Nutrient dependent changes in endogenous NUCB2/nesfatin-1 should also be considered, especially when developing diet or exogenous nesfatin-1 based potential therapies for obesity and related metabolic diseases.']"
2015-03-30T00:00:00Z,Assessing Human Diet and Movement in the Tongan Maritime Chiefdom Using Isotopic Analyses,"['This study used the isotopic analyses of bone collagen and enamel of individuals from Tongatapu to assess prehistoric diet and mobility during the Chiefdom Period. Dietary isotopic analyses indicated that those interred in the `Atele burial mounds consumed a diet consisting mostly of terrestrial C3 plants and marine animals, which corroborates with the ethnohistoric and archaeological evidence of Tongans consuming a diet mainly of starchy plants (e.g., yam, taro, and breadfruit) and marine foods (e.g., shellfish, reef and pelagic fish, sea turtles, and seaweed).The dietary analysis indicates that those interred in each burial mound ate different proportions of foods, with To-At-2 individuals consuming more terrestrial plants. Our hypothesis regarding the differences in diet between those interred in the two burial mounds fails to be rejected. A possible cause for these dietary differences may be temporal, that the mounds were in use at different points of the Chiefdom Period. Another reason posited in this study is that the two mounds interred people of different status. The degree of status disparity between the two mounds is hard to define with any certainty as To-At-2 may not contain those of chiefly class, although perhaps higher-ranking commoners such as chiefly retainers or skilled workers were those interred here. Interpreting diet and how sex, status, and division of labor affect proportions of food types proved more complicated than anticipated in this study. Our hypothesis that males and females would consume significantly different proportions of foods fails to be rejected, but finding the underlying reasons for these differences was not possible. The positive correlation between δ34S values and wt %S may indicate post-mortem diagenetic alteration and may indicate that sulfur analysis is not an effective means to study paleodiet on some Pacific islands.High levels of mobility in Tongatapu during this period of the maritime empire, if present, were not observed using isotopic analyses in this study. The strontium results indicate that the majority of the population was local and few immigrants came from other islands (at least those with discernibly different geological values). This contrasts with the archaeological evidence demonstrated by Clark et al. [31] of movement of prestige goods into and out of Tongatapu. Rather than contradicting the Clark et al [31] study, the same forces that affected the movement of goods may have affected the movement of people where the religiopolitical influence of the empire ensured the movement of tribute to Tongatapu, while that same control prevented permanent movement of outsiders to the island.This study demonstrated that further isotopic analyses with this assemblage could yield substantive information about diet, subsistence, and the sociocultural influences affecting individual food choices. The interaction between childhood and social status is not well understood in prehistoric Polynesia. Tooth collagen has been collected from the same individuals who had teeth available for 87Sr/86Sr analysis. By comparing the dietary isotopic compositions of tooth collagen to bone collagen it may be possible to examine their childhood diet in order to compare their food consumption patterns at two different points in their life histories. This may provide information as to whether there are dietary distinctions based on age and whether status-related dietary differences were present during childhood.Comparing oral health as an indicator of diet and the dietary findings from isotopic analyses is another avenue of future research. As the traditional Polynesian diet does not fall neatly into the “hunter-gatherer/agriculturalist” continuum commonly used in interpreting diet from oral health in other parts of the world [139–141] the comparison of dental health to isotopic analyses provides an opportunity to explore possible discrepancies between methods of paleodiet reconstruction.']"

2018-08-15T00:00:00Z,The fecal microbiome and metabolome differs between dogs fed Bones and Raw Food (BARF) diets and dogs fed commercial diets,"['Different food composition altered the microbiota structure significantly, while microbiota richness was not significantly changed. The BARF dogs had a significantly higher DI driven by an increase in E. coli and Streptococcus, and a decrease in Faecalibacterium. Furthermore, Clostridium perfringens was significantly higher in BARF diets. Moreover, BARF diets had a strong influence on the metabolome: while primary and secondary bile acids were not significantly altered, fecal cholesterol was increased in the feces of BARF dogs. Several metabolites like isomaltose, GABA, and GHB were different between both groups as shown in PCoA plots, heat map and random forest analysis, nonetheless these components lost significance after adjustment using univariate statistics. The results suggest a notable influence of differences of the compositions of macronutrients on the fecal microbiome and metabolome. Further studies about metabolic effects of BARF diets are required for a better understanding of these effects on dogs.']"
2016-12-30T00:00:00Z,Effects of Static or Oscillating Dietary Crude Protein Levels on Fermentation Dynamics of Beef Cattle Diets Using a Dual-Flow Continuous Culture System,"['Based on our results, oscillating dietary CP between 10–14% at 48-h intervals had no effects on ruminal N metabolism and microbial efficiency when compared with static 12% CP in beef cattle diets. These results indicate that oscillating dietary CP between 10–14% at 48-h intervals do not improve ruminal nutrient digestibility, ruminal fermentation, ruminal N metabolism, and microbial efficiency in beef cattle diets in a dual-flow continuous culture system. This suggests that either ruminal microorganisms do not respond to oscillating CP levels or are capable of coping with 48-h periods of undernourishment. It is possible that other levels of CP, other CP sources, or other oscillating regimes could help elucidating these issues. The diet with 12% CP provided positive effects on microbial N flow and microbial efficiency in the rumen; therefore, it was the best strategy to improve N utilization in the rumen. Beyond that level, there were no further benefits of feeding greater dietary CP.']"

Different lipid sources could regulate various metabolic pathways to affect the fatty acid composition in liver and muscle. In fish fed the FO diet, both increased hepatic fatty acid synthetic gene expression and decreased gene expression related to fatty acid β-oxidation may contribute to the increased lipid deposition in muscle and liver. On the contrary, in fish fed VO diets, increased gene expression related to hepatic fatty acid catabolism and β-oxidation can potentially explain the decreased lipid deposition in muscle and liver. Therefore, future studies are needed to investigate the effects of dietary lipid sources on post-translational regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism as well as the regulation mechanisms of lipogenesis and lipolysis.']"
2018-09-05T00:00:00Z,Muscle glycogen concentrations and response to diet and exercise regimes in Warmblood horses with type 2 Polysaccharide Storage Myopathy,"['The results of the present study provide a comprehensive owner reported description of the characteristics of PSSM2 in WB and for the first time provide valuable prognostic information with regard to response of PSSM2 WB to current diet and exercise management as perceived by owners. The onset of abnormal exercise responses and behaviors in PSSM2 WB was insidious with an average age of onset of 6 yrs, an age when WB horses are expected to be advancing in their training [23]. The three most common complaints of respondents owning PSSM2 WB were reluctance to collect under saddle, decline in performance, and reluctance to go forward reported by 58%, 67%, 76% of respondents, respectively. These exercise responses were uncommon in the baseline WB population at 0–27%. Respondents also reported that 6–24% of PSSM2 WB had mild lameness, muscle atrophy, muscle fasciculations and intermittent rhabdomyolysis. No horses in the baseline population had fasciculations or rhabdomyolysis whereas 18% had lameness (largely forelimb) or atrophy. Other traits and responses common to both PSSM2 WB and the baseline group included difficulty with canter transitions/leads, poor topline, sensitivity to grooming, resentment to girthing and bucking with frequencies ranging from 9–36% in baseline and 12 to 33% in PSSM2 WB. In a previous study of PSSM in WB and non-WB breeds, which included 25 WB in the present study, veterinarians reported that 66% of 188 PSSM2 WB horses had a gait abnormality and 26% had rhabdomyolysis [14]. To provide a more thorough description of the gait abnormality, participants in the present study were given detailed questions about their horse’s gait and lameness. The results revealed that the gait abnormality in PSSM2 WB consisted largely of an undiagnosed lameness that did not resolve with veterinary treatment in 60% of PSSM2 WB. Supplementing the finding of a gait abnormality by Lewis et. al. 2017, our results indicate that reluctance to go forward and to collect are prominent features of PSSM2 in WB which significantly impact the horse’s performance.The lameness and decline in performance in PSSM2 WB described in the present study may overlap with signs associated with orthopedic disorders. In particular, sacroiliac disease is characterized by poor development of epaxial muscles, asymmetric hind limb muscles, stiffness, unwillingness to work on the bit and poor quality canter [24; 25]. Scintigraphic evaluation is commonly used to diagnose back and sacroiliac disease and was performed in 8 horses in the present study [26]. Of those 8 PSSM2 WB, 4 scans had positive results, but only 1 respondent indicated that their horse had been diagnosed with sacroiliac disease; however, the 3 remaining horses had reported positive uptake in the pelvic area. The overlap in clinical signs and common occurrence of sacroiliac disease in WB certainly suggests that diseases of the back and sacroiliac joint should be ruled out prior to performing a muscle biopsy. Additionally, a wide range of training and saddling issues could also produce many of the performance-related signs seen in PSSM2 horses and it seems prudent to fully explore these issues prior to a muscle biopsy [27].Fortunately, by following the recommended diet and exercise regimes, 80% of PSSM2 WB were reported to show overall improvement as well as a significant decrease in signs of rhabdomyolysis, muscle atrophy, change in behavior and decline in performance. This is in agreement with a 2007 epidemiologic study of WB diagnosed with PSSM that reported 71% of WB with PSSM (type 1 or type 2 not specified) improved with recommendations for a low starch, fat supplemented diet and regular exercise [12]. The reported improvement is also higher than the placebo effect found in a caregiver study in which 40% of owners of dogs with osteoarthritis reported a beneficial effect when they unknowingly administered a placebo [28]. It is important to recognize, however, that although abnormal exercise responses and behaviors improved, one third of respondents felt that their horse’s training had plateaued and 18% felt their horse’s performance had declined after implementing recommendations. The most persistent traits were reluctance to go forward (45% still present), difficulty with transitions (33% still present), reluctance to collect (30% still present), poor topline muscle (30% still present) and muscle fasciculations (24% still present). Thus, owners of PSSM2 WB should be aware that although the majority of horses improve with the current diet and exercise recommendations, half of the horses are unable to achieve the owner’s performance expectations. Sixteen percent of respondents in the survey changed the horse’s discipline to one requiring less collection and 22% of PSSM2 WB were eventually euthanized or donated to a University. Our results suggest that even when following the current diet and exercise recommendations, there are residual effects of the muscle disorder underlying PSSM2. Potentially, this study’s results may have been biased since owners of more severely affected horses could have been more motivated to participate in the study.With the present study design, there was no means to determine how stringently recommendations were followed by horse owners or what specific diet changes were responsible for the perceived improvement amongst horse owners. The most consistent changes in diet made by owners of PSSM2 WB were the addition of a fat supplement in 54% of horses, use of a low starch high fat feed in 51% and supplementation with vitamin E in 71% of PSSM2 WB. Generally, the dietary recommendations may have benefited horses because owners sought nutritional advice ensuring that horses received a balanced diet that was relatively low in starch and sugar, supplemented with fat and contained a quality protein source and vitamin E. Beginning in 2014, recommendations for PSSM2 horses included adding a protein source or amino acid supplement to build topline muscles and providing long and low warm up exercise to relax the back and strengthen topline. Provision of amino acid supplements has been shown to increase muscle mass in exercising horses as assessed by subjective muscle scoring [29]. However, there was no significant difference in performance when comparing horses that received recommendations before 2014 to those after–as shown by 50 vs 44% of PSSM2 WB horses advanced in their training, respectively. A clearer understanding of the basis for PSSM2 in WB and design of controlled diet trials and are needed to optimize diet and exercise regimes for these horses.The diet and exercise regime recommended for PSSM2 horses was originally designed to decrease glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle and improve oxidative metabolism of glycogen and fat during exercise. In PSSM1 horses, the diet effectively lowers serum insulin concentrations which could thereby decrease glucose uptake and decrease activation of glycogen synthase in skeletal muscle [9; 30]. Whereas glycogen concentrations are >1.5 fold normal in PSSM1 WB, a recent study did not find significantly elevated mean glycogen concentrations in the 13 PSSM2 WB studied [14]. Similarly, glycogen concentrations in the present study were not significantly different from horses with no evidence of a myopathy in muscle samples and were lower than PSSM1 horses. However, there was a large variation in glycogen content in PSSM2 WB both in snap frozen and shipped samples. Glycogen continues to be metabolized during shipping, and low levels could be a reflection of continued metabolism; however, control samples were also shipped in a similar fashion. It is possible that the horses with elevated muscle glycogen concentrations represent the extremes within one phenotype embodied by a disorder of glycogen metabolism. Most WB horses diagnosed with PSSM2 had very similar clinical signs and glycogen storage disorders in humans can have variable muscle glycogen concentrations [31]. Alternatively, those PSSM2 WB with glycogen concentrations as high as PSSM1 could represent a group of horses with a separate disease from horses with lower glycogen concentrations. The histopathologic criteria for PSSM2 are nonspecific which increases the possibility that more than one etiology for muscle disease falls under this histopathologic diagnosis. Four horses were later found to have histochemical characteristic of abnormal aggregates of desmin within muscle biopsies suggestive of myofibrillar myopathy (MFM) [22]. This finding again could represent progression of the PSSM2 phenotype or could represent a separate disease entity. Determining whether horses within the PSSM2 diagnosis have one etiopathology, or separate etiologies, will require further biochemical and genetic analyses.An unexpected finding in the present study was the high prevalence of gastric ulcers (32%) confirmed by endoscopy in the PSSM2 WB horses. This is slightly lower than the prevalence of squamous ulceration (40%) reported in Warmblood show jumping horses [32]. It is unlikely that gastric ulcers themselves accounted for clinical signs of PSSM2 in WB horses because many of the horses had been effectively treated for ulcers yet performance problems persisted. The higher prevalence of ulcers in the PSSM2 WB could be related to high exercise frequency and performing at competitions; information that was unfortunately not obtained in our study [33].The authors acknowledge the limitations of the present study, particularly that the results of the questionnaires are based on the perceptions of owners with varying levels of experience, and not those of a veterinarian.In summary, the results of the present study indicate that PSSM2 in WB has a strong impact on performance affecting a horse’s willingness to collect and go forward. By following diet and exercise recommendations, exercise responses appear to improve in 80% of horses; however, 30–45% of horses have residual signs that impacted the horse’s ability to advance in training. While a small proportion of PSSM2 WB had elevated muscle glycogen concentrations, the majority of PSSM2 WB had concentrations at or below concentrations in horses without histopathologic evidence of a myopathy.']"

Similarly, the effects certain diets may induce on the dynamics of the gut microbiota are still being determined. This study demonstrates the novel approach of demonstrating the usefulness of the virome and provirome in ancient specimens for the reconstruction of the diets of extinct cultures. In fact, the apparent potential and abundance of proviruses in coprolites point to their importance in future molecular paleovirological studies. Our results complement the currently limited molecular data available on the diets of indigenous cultures prior to the arrival and colonization by Europeans [42]. Fan-Ng, et al have also shown that viral sequences found in paleofeces of extinct animals can be used as a means of taking a peek at the past and an opportunity to reconstruct their diet [43]. Our study and previously published results are also slowly changing the apparent dogmata on the half-life of DNA and its resilience over time [44,45]; however, DNA resiliency studies have been done using purified DNA, thus shedding little light on the survival of intracellular DNA during taphonomic processes over millennia [46]. It is clear from our studies, though, that intracellular DNA is in fact more resilient than previously expected.']"
2018-04-18T00:00:00Z,"Relationship between food waste, diet quality, and environmental sustainability","['Using novel, interdisciplinary methods, we demonstrate that the average person living in America wastes nearly one pound of food daily. Furthermore, we find that higher diet quality is associated with greater food waste but less cropland waste, and greater waste of agricultural irrigation water and pesticides. This is largely due to the greater amount of fruits and vegetables included in higher quality diets, which have higher rates of waste, lower cropland needs, and higher application rates of agricultural inputs compared to other crops. Food waste is a critical component of environmental sustainability that, until now, has not been rigorously analyzed alongside diet quality. The current results suggest that simultaneous efforts to improve diet quality and reduce food waste may be critical. Practically, increasing consumers’ knowledge about how to prepare and store fruits and vegetables will be an essential component to reducing food waste. A number of important efforts have been proposed or are underway to reduce and repurpose food waste at the individual and institutional levels, yet further research is needed to better understand the comparative effectiveness of these efforts. Additional research is also needed to better understand how reducing food waste can contribute to monetary savings at the household level, especially for those with limited food budgets.']"

Such high prevalence of GXN and maternal anemia may reflect the poor nutritional status experienced by these women prior and during pregnancy, which can have deleterious lifetime effects for the dyad mother-infant. Sociodemographic, environmental and gestational characteristics were associated with the occurrence of GXN and maternal anemia. Most of these factors can be addressed during antenatal care, underlying the importance of rethinking current protocols related to nutrition in pregnancy.']"

Adult p53 mutant animals have smaller wings than wild-type, but normal brain size. Furthermore, p53 does not control energy consumption during larval nutrient restriction as it has been shown in adult flies subjected to a similar nutritional stress. Hence, p53 is dispensable for brain growth during nutritional stress. Thus, we conclude that during larval development p53 regulates growth but not the resistance to nutrient restriction in Drosophila.']"

2018-12-20T00:00:00Z,Gut microbiota profiling in Norwegian weaner pigs reveals potentially beneficial effects of a high-fiber rapeseed diet,"['In conclusion, RSF enhanced the growth of beneficial bacteria and depressed the abundance of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria in the large intestine without disturbing the main gut microbiota structure and activities. These properties contribute to the maintenance of gut health of the host. Moreover, the relative abundances of bacterial phylotypes did not change in RSF diet fed pigs, while some bacterial groups including potentially pathogenic phylotypes were more abundant in the control fed pigs that experienced diarrhea. This is an important finding to be supported with more comprehensive studies, as post-weaning diarrhea is a common cause of mortality and morbidity in young pigs. These beneficial effects of RSF on gut microbiota have the potential to contribute the growth and health of the pigs and promote RSF as an alternative feed ingredient to soybean. Furthermore, optimization of the amount of rapeseed co-products or their dietary fiber composition in the diet formulation may help to improve rapeseed diets, by minimizing the reduction in nutrient digestibility and maximizing the health-promoting effects on gut microbiota.']"

The modest ER stress and inflammation in HS/HS group may be attributing to the antagonistic effect of polyunsaturated fatty acid to the amplification of UPR [61] but we could not exclude the contribution of other bioactive compounds such as isoflavone and Vitamin E contained in soybean oil. And, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the ER stress response to high-fat diet enriched with lard oil and soybean oil and indentify the validity of low-fat diet intervention in alleviating the ER stress in high-fat diet induced obese rats. Despite abundant evidences emerged demonstrating the important role of ER stress in obesity-related insulin resistance and NAFLD, studies are warranted to further clarify the causal relationship among ER stress signaling pathways, the origin of obesity, insulin resistance and NAFLD.']"
2016-08-17T00:00:00Z,The Gut Microbiomes of Two Pachysoma MacLeay Desert Dung Beetle Species (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) Feeding on Different Diets,"['This is the first study to investigate the gut microbiomes of any dung beetle feeding on dry food sources and to compare those of closely related adult dung beetle species with very different diets but from the same locality. Pachysoma spp. are ecologically important in arid environments where they undoubtedly participate in nutrient cycling and bioturbation [41]. We have demonstrated that, as predicted, the gut microbiomes differed significantly between two species which feed on different substrates. However, both populations showed large intraspecific variations. Thus, to further characterise the gut microbiomes of these Pachysoma species, the number of individuals studied should be increased and populations from different sites investigated. Such experiments would make it possible to evaluate whether interspecific variation was higher than intraspecific variation within a single Pachysoma species.We are unable to fully assess whether host phylogeny or the host diet is the dominant driver of the Pachysoma gut microbiomes. Nevertheless, we provide evidence that diet probably plays a significant role, particularly noting the fact that the gut microbiomes of the detritivorous P. endroedyi (feeding on complex food sources) have higher bacterial diversities than those of the coprophagous species (feeding on relatively simple food sources) [17, 48]. Functional gene analysis of the microbiomes of P. endroedyi and P. striatum could potentially assist in confirming the role that host diet plays in Pachysoma gut microbiome assembly [11].']"

In the present study, we show that high salt diet feeding led to cardiovascular and renal dysfunction in uninephrectomized rats implicating epigenetic alterations (microRNAs (miRs)) and renin angiotensin system (RAS). In a nutshell, our study demonstrated that uninephrectomy per se caused no adverse effects, but sensitized the animals to dietary manipulation (high salt diet feeding) culminating in exacerbated cardiac, vascular and renal dysfunction manifested by decreased baroreflex sensitivity, increased in vivo cardiovascular reactivity to Ang II and fibrosis in cardiac, vascular and renal tissue. This cardiac dysfunction is attributed to the activation of local RAS, altered cardiac miRNA-25, -99b, -155, -451 and their corresponding targeted proteins—SERCA2, p-AKT, and p-AMPK (Fig 6). Since the pattern of circulating miRs showed a pattern exactly opposite to that of the heart, caution must be exercised in utilizing them as clinical biomarkers.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0180490.g006\nFig 6\n\nProbable mechanism showing high salt diet intake evokes cardiac dysfunction in uninephrectomy.\nUNX combined with HSD intake upregulates AT1R, LTCCs leading to increased cardiovascular reactivity and decreased BRS; upregulates miR-25, miR-155 and miR-451 and downregulates miR-99b affecting SERCA2, AKT and AMPK leading to impaired excitation-coupling cycle, fibrosis and hypertrophy culminating in cardiac dysfunction.\n\n\n']"
2018-12-26T00:00:00Z,Seasonal changes in diet and chemical defense in the Climbing Mantella frog (Mantella laevigata),"['We found substantial variation in the M. laevigata diet between seasons. Although we used both molecular and morphological methods to assay diet in the present study, these results are only a snapshot in time and repeated sampling of the same individuals by stomach flushing or fecal barcoding would be a valuable step forward in understanding diet variation a finer scale. Moreover, leaf litter studies coupled with diet analyses would be valuable in assessing the intersection of prey preference, prey availability, and frog behavior. Finally, although there were differences in the abundance of specific alkaloids between frogs collected in the wet and dry season, overall alkaloid profiles were similar across seasons. The ability for adult poison frogs to retain their alkaloids for years in captivity coupled with our observations of cross-seasonal stability in alkaloid profiles suggests that poison frog defenses are buffered against acute environmental changes. Nonetheless, changes in alkaloid abundance even at the short timescale we consider here suggest that more extreme, long-term shifts in temperature and humidity will impact poison frog alkaloid abundance and continued long-term monitoring of poison frog populations is warranted. Given the unique and fascinating link between arthropod diversity and poison frog biology, poison frogs may serve as a useful model for understanding the ecological consequences of global environmental change across trophic levels.']"

Both puffin and herring diet were described with more diversity at a higher taxonomic resolution with our molecular approach compared to conventional methods, enhancing our knowledge of the biology of and interactions between these animals. The sensitivity of these techniques to detect the prey of prey is an important consideration for molecular scatology, particularly when de novo diet assembly with universal primers is concerned. We suggest that results of DNA-based diet studies be viewed from the perspective of a food chain, rather than simply diet, due to the effect of secondary consumption. Further, because of the considerable discrepancies in the types, coverage, and frequency of occurrence of prey taxa between markers, we recommend the use of multiple barcoding markers for taxon identification.\tThe broad significance of our study is that both herring and puffins, previously considered to be part of the planktonic food web only, prove instead to be part also of the inshore or intertidal food web, in which benthic production also plays a role. Secondary consumers in this web can no longer be assumed to derive their energy and nutrients from planktonic production alone. Contaminant studies will need to take into account a possibly greater role for benthic and intertidal pathways leading to higher trophic levels of the Gulf of Maine food web.\tWhat a predator eats is perhaps the most ecologically important information we can learn about an animal. These predator-prey relationships are used to describe food chains, which provide the framework from which we understand how energy flows through an ecosystem. To improve our capacity to effectively manage and conserve marine ecosystems, we propose a multi-trophic, multi-locus, pyrosequencing approach for a comprehensive description of a food web from which we can interpret ecosystem functioning.']"

Evidence from Odisha’s Mamata scheme,"['This paper provides the first quantitative estimates of the impact of the Mamata maternity benefit scheme on exposure to nutrition interventions and household food security in Odisha. We show that the scheme had positive and significant effects on food security, registration of the pregnancy and receipt of ANC and of IFA tablets from government frontline health workers. However, we caution that without the presence of a strong health system, the fulfillment of conditions may not be as straightforward. Once data from the fourth round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) become available, further research can be conducted to examine the extent to which improvements in Odisha’s nutrition outcomes have been driven by participation in the Mamata scheme.India continues to contribute substantially to the global burden of maternal and child malnutrition. However, the Prime Minister’s 2017 Union budgetary announcement to scale up maternity benefits nationwide will constitute one of the largest cash transfer schemes in the world and will have the potential to influence several maternal and child health and nutrition indicators. Therefore, the evidence we present here on the impact of a CCT in one state in India is both timely and relevant.']"

The nutritional status of children under five years is determined by socioeconomic, cultural, household, maternal, and child level factors. The effect of socioeconomic factors on underweight, wasting and stunting is exhibited independently and mediated through maternal and child level factors.It is logical to conclude that empowering women as well as improving the socioeconomic status of households may contribute significantly to reducing morbidity and mortality from undernutrition.

One of the possible reasons for having persistently high level of undernutrition among tribal children is the decline in the budgetary allocation on ICDS in recent years [20]. Our analysis of the state’s budget also reveals that the nutrition expenditure as a percentage of the state budget has drastically declined from 1.68% in 2012–13 to 0.94% in 2018–19 (S1 Fig). Moreover, Singh and Sethi [22] showed that tribal sub plan funds have been underutilised by Maharashtra, particularly in two sectors (rural development and nutrition). As the main underlying cause of undernutrition among the tribal children is the poor socioeconomic conditions of the tribal population, there is a need for a multi-pronged strategy for redressing this problem.Aside from increasing the budgetary allocation for nutrition specific interventions such as APJ Abdul Kalam Amrut Aahar Yojana and ICDS, the state needs to ensure appropriate usage of funds. In addition, there is an urgent need to tighten the implementation mechanism of the Public Distribution System (PDS) in the tribal areas of Palghar. The department of Civil Supplies (food security) must ensure that tribal families are not deprived of the ration that they are entitled to because of issues like non-possession of card. Besides that, Maharashtra should seriously consider providing other nutritious food items through PDS in the tribal areas so that the nutritional needs of the tribal children and adults are met, and the problem of micronutrient deficiencies is effectively addressed.Aside from improving socioeconomic conditions of the tribal population, there is a need to improve the child care and feeding practices. The positive breast-feeding practices related to exclusive breastfeeding during the first half of infancy and continued breastfeeding through the second year of life and beyond encountered in the population should be strongly promoted. Practices that require attention are the delay in introduction of complementary foods and the low dietary diversity. This should be addressed by providing education about child care and feeding practices to the women from the time they become pregnant.']"

These effects were more evident with the addition of plant extracts (source of polyphenols) compared to the addition of vitamin E. Indeed, the diet with linseed and plant extracts showed to up-regulate a large number of genes compared to the linseed supplementation alone. These genes were involved in many functions belonging to the regulation of transcriptional activity and glucose metabolism aimed to support muscle tissue trophy, vascular homeostasis and muscle activity. Differently, the addition of vitamin E to a n-3 PUFA-rich diet did not show any significant difference in the transcriptome compared to the linseed supplementation alone. These findings provide new knowledge on the effects of dietary plant extracts and n-3 PUFA on pig muscle transcriptome. Further investigation on the phenotypical effects in vivo and in derived meat products, as well as the potential benefits for consumers, are needed for both research and industry purposes.']"

Supplemental DHA, however, did not lower hepatic injury as evidenced by no significant reduction of ALT levels. We assessed the reversibility of NASH by returning mice with WD-induced NASH to a low-fat low-cholesterol chow diet without or with supplemental DHA for 8 weeks. This diet returned NASH livers to livers with minimal evidence of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis or liver injury within 8 wks. This treatment, while ideal for clinical use, is likely not sustainable in NASH patients due to poor compliance to dietary therapy. As such, our studies with the Ldlr-/- mouse suggest that adding DHA (at ~2% total energy) to a patient’s regular diet will block disease progression, which is a key goal in disease management.']"

Our results have potentially broad implications for the study of maternal effects in laboratory or farm animals, and also for conservation biology, where the effects of parental population management must be monitored on multiple levels. In the feed engineering industry, the composition of the diet provided to breeding hens can vary according to the price of raw materials. It is worth investigating whether certain types of raw material influence the quality of eggs and the subsequent behavior–such as fearfulness–of broiler chickens and laying hens. The potential impact of the maternal diet on food neophobia has considerable ecological implications, because food neophobia can compromise the ability of birds to cope with novel environments and novel food resources [70]. Finally, our data indicate that the chemosensory experience in ovo orients subsequent feeding behavior. This suggests a common principle of sensory system development across vertebrate taxa.']"

Furthermore, if the world’s population grows as anticipated, food production must change to fit within available land and acceptable levels of land use and GHG emissions [11, 65–66]. The data suggest that adopting nutritionally balanced diets that involve a greater consumption of fruits and vegetables, plus lower consumption of grains, fats and sugars, along with developing proteins that require less land to produce should help to ensure sustainable and balanced diets through the coming decades [e.g. see: 67]. Such a transition would reduce global GHG emissions, better support ecosystem services and biodiversity, and have significant benefits for human health.']"

Although some formulations of tilapia flour-enriched pasta exhibited an increase in the values of redness, yellowness, lipid oxidation and protein oxidation, the substitution of wheat flour by tilapia flour up to 6% can be considered a suitable strategy to improve the nutritional aspects of dried pasta without negatively affecting the storage quality of this product during at least 21 days at 25°C.

L23 against cyanobacteria and green algae,"['This study demonstrated the ability of the Aeromonas strain L23, isolated from a lake at which HABs frequently occur, to inhibit the growth of different types of microalgae including three cyanobacteria and two green algae using their extracellular substances in a manner dependent on the nutritional status. Specifically, the algicidal activity for different types of microalgae varied depending on the nutrient loading. It becomes clear that alga-bacterium interactions are highly complex as the interactions between algal species and bacteria varies continuously with nutritional status in the field. These insights will now pave the way toward elaborate studies which contribute a better understanding of the role of algicidal bacteria within algal communities in the field.']"

These results are clinically important, as inflammatory parameters are associated with a further decline in skeletal muscle mass, and these parameters predict mortality. An increase in physical performance is particularly important, as it is associated with a higher chance of reaching constant or decreased log-CRP values.Further research is needed to examine the physiological process behind the effects of physical training and nutritional support on inflammatory parameters in prefrail and frail older adults.']"
2018-10-04T00:00:00Z,Gender and household structure factors associated with maternal and child undernutrition in rural communities in Ethiopia,"['In this study, we have reported very high levels of child stunting (up to 54%) and underweight (up to 36%). We also report moderate to high levels of maternal undernutrition. Gender, as well as socioeconomic and demographic factors, such as empowerment imbalance, control of farm produce, physiological density, household size and dietary habits during pregnancy, showed significant associations, or trends, with maternal and child undernutrition in bivariate and multiple variable analysis. We were also concerned with the poor dietary habits, including existing food taboos, of the women during pregnancy. Our findings stress the need for health program implementers to provide nutrition education before, during and after pregnancy, as the health of mothers is critical to the health of both the mother and fetus. Overall, this cross-sectional study provides important information to nutrition/health service providers in rural communities in evaluating and strengthening existing health programs targeting women and children, and in the development of new programs. Attention should be focussed on women’s education, access and control of resources, as well as better reproductive health services, to improve women’s balance of power in the household and ensure optimum family size for better nutrition.']"
2019-08-09T00:00:00Z,"Trends, prevalence and determinants of childhood chronic undernutrition in regional divisions of Bangladesh: Evidence from demographic health surveys, 2011 and 2014","['Bangladesh has addressed decline in stunting levels in the past. Further decline in stunting is possible through region-specific multipronged interventions, targeting children at risk [39–42]. Dhaka has made laudable improvement in child nutrition and immensely contributed to the reduction of the overall levels of stunting in Bangladesh. However, unlike Dhaka, no other regional division of Bangladesh has been able to reduce stunting significantly in the recent past (2011–2014). To attain the targeted SDG goal of reducing stunting by 2030, series of actions are necessary [43–44]. Sylhet and Barisal require strong push to improve nutritional status of children belonging to Muslim and economically poor households to break the cycle of malnutrition. Besides socio-economic progress, substantial improvement of mother’s health and better involvement of men in formal and nutritional education may help tackling stunting in these two critical divines of Bangladesh. Reduction of stunting in Sylhet also requires attention across population groups, besides economic and health improvement.Overall, to address stunting, Bangladesh needs to focus on household wealth generation, improvement of maternal health, interventions on vulnerable groups including the children from poorest socio-economic strata or children in the urban areas and strengthening the role of father to improve their knowledge in varying aspects like family planning, reduction of fertility, child nutrition and maternal care. Further, a targeted multi-sectoral programme is essential to reduce the prevalence of short heighted girls at an early age, to progress knowledge on complementary food for young children and to reinforce family planning program, aiming to increase the age at birth and to decrease higher order births, in order to achieve the SDGs by 2030.']"

The presence of such a small core may begin to explain why the horse is so susceptible to metabolic dysfunction.']"
2016-02-17T00:00:00Z,Activation of the Nrf2 Cell Defense Pathway by Ancient Foods: Disease Prevention by Important Molecules and Microbes Lost from the Modern Western Diet,"['Findings reported here identify akyl catechols as potent natural co-factors for activation of the Nrf2 cellular defense pathway both in vitro and in vivo. The alkyl catechols and also catechol, another Nrf2 co-factor, are widely available from plant sources but must be generated from these sources either by microbial digestion or heat. Nonetheless, the general availability of these Nrf2 co-factors from numerous natural sources suggests that they are integral to proper functioning of the Nrf2 defense. Until recent times, dietary sources of akyl catechols and catechol were common, but now virtually all are rare in modern commercially available foods due to changes in food preservation and processing. Consequently, findings here illustrate important distinctions between traditional and modern diets, specifically as they relate to Nrf2 defense against disease. Findings here also describe previously undocumented connections between specific compounds found in fruits and vegetables and specific bacteria that convert these compounds to Nrf2 activators. Although there is a general consensus that diets rich in fruits and vegetables are beneficial for health (reviewed in [146, 147]); and, similarly, that probiotic bacteria are beneficial (reviewed in [103, 148, 149]), mechanistic understanding of such benefits is incomplete. In particular, functional connections between specific probiotics and diets rich in fruits and vegetables as they relate to Nrf2 defense have not been defined previously. Thus, findings here provide new molecular framework for a broader understanding of how diets rich in fruit and vegetables, in combination with specific PAD-expressing probiotics, can promote Nrf2 defense, prevent disease, and improve overall health.']"
2015-04-01T00:00:00Z,Dietary Factors Associated with Faecal Consistency and Other Indicators of Gastrointestinal Health in the Captive Cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus),"['An epidemiological relationship between diet and gastrointestinal disease indicators has been demonstrated and significant risk factors requiring further investigation and empirical testing were revealed. The use of muscle meat, with or without carcass components, was associated with an improved gastrointestinal health status, in contrast to the use of commercially prepared diets. Vomiting and diarrhoea were less likely to occur in animals fed carcass components (ribs and long-bones), while muscle meat-fed cheetahs were at reduced risk of gastritis and non-specific gastrointestinal disease, as well as having improved faecal consistency. Prevalence of gastrointestinal disease was lowest in carcass-fed animals although no epidemiological relationship could be detected for any broad diet category during multivariate analysis. Interestingly, specific prey species were identified as having a significant impact on risk of gastrointestinal disease during univariate analysis, whereby chicken was found to have a protective effect (reducing the odds of gastrointestinal disease), but horse meat and goat were shown to increase the risk of gastritis, or vomiting (respectively). Horse was the only prey species to maintain a significant (detrimental) relationship with gastritis risk during multivariate analysis, which may be related to its protein content and/or digestibility, or its relative lack of animal fibre. The findings of the current study builds on existing empirical research and zoo husbandry guidelines to support a recommendation towards a greater inclusion of carcass and muscle meat components in the diet of captive cheetahs.']"
2016-04-29T00:00:00Z,Effect of Dietary Starch Source and Concentration on Equine Fecal Microbiota,"['A number of previous studies demonstrated that adding a high-starch concentrate to a predominantly forage diet can alter the equine gastrointestinal microbial community. The current study also found that adding starch to the diet can alter the microbial community and it expanded those findings by examining differences due to starch source (corn, oats or wheat middlings). At equal starch intakes, corn produced more marked changes in the fecal microbial ecosystem than oats. Therefore, differences in composition and morphology of the starch granule, or in other components of the grains, could also affect amylolytic proliferation. A variety of predominant amylolytic bacteria were observed in horses fed hay and oats. However, the predominant amylolytic bacterium in corn and wheat fed horses was E. faecalis, which was present at much greater number (10,000-fold) in the horses on these diets. To develop a better understanding of the pathogenesis of several detrimental health conditions (i.e., colic, laminitis) that can be triggered by carbohydrate overload, as well as aid in the development of effective treatment strategies, further studies using higher levels of starch intake are needed.']"
2015-08-11T00:00:00Z,Trophic Dynamics of Filter Feeding Bivalves in the Yangtze Estuarine Intertidal Marsh: Stable Isotope and Fatty Acid Analyses,"['Based on distribution patterns and food sources, our study indicates that the different bivalve species examined in this study, had separate ecological niches in the Yangtze estuarine marshes. Both bivalve, S. constricta and G. chinensis mainly ingested organic matter from POM. Diatoms, bacteria, dinoflagellates, vascular plants and zooplankton formed major components of the diet of bivalves. Although the contribution of diatoms to the diet of S. constricta was consistent, the relative contribution of other food items varied between summer and winter, indicating seasonal changes in food availability. The seasonal variation patterns in item composition between S. constricta and POM suggest that the bivalve has an assimilation selectivity when they ingest organic matter from POM. Constant FA profiles and varied SI values indicated that S. constricta had a similar diet at different sites, although the material was derived from different carbon origins. It is suggested that species-specific and temporal and/or spatial variability in the feeding of bivalves can affect their ecological functions in intertidal marshes. This should be considered in the study of food web dynamics and the flow of material in estuarine ecosystems.']"
2016-04-05T00:00:00Z,Why Are Some Population Interventions for Diet and Obesity More Equitable and Effective Than Others? The Role of Individual Agency,"['Much current policy for improving diet and reducing obesity focuses on population interventions that require individuals to use a high level of individual agency to benefit. These are likely to be less effective, and less equitable, than interventions requiring less agency. Although we have focused here on diet and obesity, these arguments ring true across many areas of public health.Whilst action across the full spectrum of the framework described in Fig 2 is required, more attention should be given to the development and implementation of low-agency population interventions. Many before us have made similar arguments (e.g., [7,21,28]), yet action to implement low-agency population interventions remains limited. Politicians, civil servants, researchers, and others may shy away from low-agency interventions, as they see these as more politically difficult. We all need to have more courage to argue the case that these interventions can be publically acceptable, support people to live healthier lives, and reduce inequalities in health. Low-agency population interventions should be central to public health action on diet and obesity.']"
2012-10-03T00:00:00Z,"Earliest Porotic Hyperostosis on a 1.5-Million-Year-Old Hominin, Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania","[""The observation of porotic hyperostosis on the 1.5 Ma OH 81 child indicates early childhood was also nutritionally stressful for hominins, even well before the establishment of the sedentary, food-producing societies of the Holocene, and it also dispels the notion of invariable dietary affluence in the early Pleistocene. And, based on other pathological hominin fossils from more recent in time, the Pleistocene continued to be a stressful period for some hominin populations, in some places. For instance, cribra orbitalia, a specific form of porotic hyperostosis, affects one third of the Atapuerca (Spain) Middle Pleistocene Sima de los Huesos (Bone Pit) population [47].Stratigraphically, OH 81 was recovered from the lower portion of upper Bed II of the Olduvai Formation, in which a geologically documented drying trend ultimately resulted in the disappearance of the Olduvai paleolake by late upper Bed II times [48]. This evolving climatic upheaval might have contributed to resource scarcity and nutritional stresses for Olduvai hominins. Thus, although archaeological evidence (in the form of stone tool butchery damage on ungulate fossils) [38] confirms the importance of meat-eating in human evolution, the same evidence weighed against nutritionally relevant paleopathological data, such as those for OH 81, reveals a more realistically nuanced picture of our prehistory.Further broader relevance of anemia-induced porotic hyperostosis on OH 81 is its support for hypotheses that meat-eating was a fundamental, rather than marginal, aspect of some hominin diets during the early Pleistocene [38], [49]. There is disagreement, but a compelling body of data suggests [50]–[54] that extant chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) might eat meat to compensate for seasonal shortfalls in protein and/or important micronutrients [55]. Despite the possibility that chimpanzees are at least seasonally obligate faunivores, porotic hyperostosis is virtually absent in these apes, our closest living relatives. In contrast, the pathology's relative prevalence in prehistoric hominins seems to indicate that a significant deriviation in hominin metabolic physiology from the ancestral condition occurred sometime after the late Miocene split between the hominin and panin lineages. The presence of anemia-induced porotic hypertostosis on the 1.5 Ma OH 81 hominin parietal, indicates indirectly that by at least the early Pleistocene meat had become so essential to proper hominin functioning that its paucity or lack led to deleterious pathological conditions. Actualistic studies on the ecology of scavenging show that this strategy is feasible only on a seasonal basis in some modern East African savannas and that it provides low flesh yields [56], [57]. A physiology adapted to the consumption of meat on a regular basis, as inferred for the species to which OH81 belonged, is in contradiction with this scenario, since it would not survive acquiring flesh so sporadically. This grants more support to the hypothesis that some hominins were actively engaged in hunting by 1.5 Ma.Because fossils of very young hominin children are so rare in the early Pleistocene fossil record of East Africa, the occurrence of porotic hyperostosis on one, OH 81, suggests we have only scratched the surface in our understanding of nutrition and health in ancestral populations of the deep past.""]"

Further, our data suggest that defects in lymphogenesis are the result of impairments to niche function early in the development process, resulting in diminished cellular differentiation. It is currently unclear if these processes are mediated primarily by obesity, or if the increase in adiposity and some combination of dietary factors are causative.

2017-05-01T00:00:00Z,"Isotopic reconstruction of the weaning process in the archaeological population of Canímar Abajo, Cuba: A Bayesian probability mixing model approach","['The combination of the results of two Bayesian probability models (WARN and SIAR) enabled the estimation of age at the start and the end of the weaning process in an ancient Caribbean population, while implementing more realistic isotope modeling parameters, such as non-static bone collagen to food isotope discrimination factors, protein contents for different sources and bone collagen turnover rates. The WARN model was useful in providing an estimate for the start and the end of weaning. Furthermore, it complemented the SIAR model weaning age results which used inferred breast milk isotopic compositions and also provided probabilistic changes in resource importance over time.Results presented here suggest that milk was the main source of dietary protein for Canímar Abajo juveniles during their first two years of life. Some supplements, with low nitrogen isotopic values and protein contents, such as tropical fruits and root cultigens, were likely used to feed juveniles during this period; but the importance of these foods was probably low compared to breast milk. Around 2 years of age, supplements gained importance in Canímar Abajo juvenile diets. By then, C3 plants, including legumes, were probably continuously consumed as weaning foods. There appears to be a strong relationship between breastfeeding and the survival chances for juveniles, as suggested by a higher mortality for those infants whose diets were supplemented earlier in life.At the age of three, the weaning process for the Canímar Abajo juveniles was likely completed. Subsequently, the juveniles were provided with a transitional diet, isotopically different from adult diets, consisting mainly of foods with more depleted carbon and nitrogen isotopic values such as root cultigens, legumes, and possibly marunguey. Maize and other resources used by the adults, such as marine/riverine animals with more enriched carbon and nitrogen isotopic values, appear not to have had contributed substantially to juvenile diets during their first years of life.The combined use of the SIAR and WARN models helped to facilitate greater resolution in reconstructing the weaning process of the Canímar Abajo archaeological populations and, in doing so, may have established a new procedure for future isotope based weaning reconstructions.']"
2019-11-05T00:00:00Z,Manganese levels in infant formula and young child nutritional beverages in the United States and France: Comparison to breast milk and regulations,"['In this study we used simultaneous particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE) and Rutherford backscattering (RBS) spectrometry to measure the concentration of Mn in μg of element per g of dried product for a selection of infant formulas and young child nutritional beverage products purchased in the US and France. The accuracy of PIXE/RBS for measuring Mn was assessed by the analysis of a National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Material®, 1849a Infant/Adult Nutritional Formula; the relative error for the measurements of Mn was -0.22%. All 44 of the samples we analyzed had measurable concentrations of Mn.In general, products with supplemental Mn had higher Mn concentrations than products without supplemental Mn (Fig 1 and Table 3). For products without supplemental Mn, products with chocolate had the most Mn, followed by soy, rice, and cow milk, all of which had more Mn than reported concentrations in breast milk (Fig 1 and Table 3).The ranges of concentrations of Mn in the infant formulas and young child nutritional beverage products greatly exceeded the ranges of Mn concentrations reported in breast milk. The ranges of Mn concentrations in the 17 infant and follow-on formula products purchased in France were in compliance with French, European, and international standards. The ranges of Mn concentrations in the 25 infant formula and young child nutritional beverages purchased in the US satisfied the US minimum standards for infant formula. While 2 of the 16 US infant formula products and 5 of the 8 products labeled for children over 12 months that we tested exceeded the CAC international Guidance Upper Level (GUL) of 100 Mn/100 kcal for infant formulas, US laws do not currently stipulate a maximum Mn content for infant formulas or regulate Mn content in formulas or powders for children over 12 months old and the CAC does not stipulate a GUL for Mn for formula products for children over 12 months old 89].Given the recent research demonstrating adverse effects of excess Mn exposure for neurodevelopment [4–7,10–47], stricter upper limits for Mn content in infant formulas should be considered by regulators. The 38-year-old requirement for minimum Mn content in infant formulas in the US [1] may need to be updated to make it closer to the Mn content in breast milk, and a maximum Mn content for infant formulas and young child nutritional beverage products may be appropriate for the US market.In the meantime, it must be noted that supplementation of infant formulas and young child nutritional beverage products with Mn is unnecessary to meet the current health-based regulatory minimum of 1 μg Mn/100 kcal stipulated by the CAC, EU and Republic of France, or the US minimum of 5 μg Mn/100 kcal [1–3,9,90]. There is no proven or likely benefit from Mn supplementation in these products and some researchers contend there is potential for adverse neurodevelopmental health effects in infants and young children. Pending research on dietary Mn exposures that examine health effects at high and low Mn dietary intakes in neonates, infants, and young children, formula manufacturers may consider taking measures to reduce Mn content in their products to approach the Mn concentrations found in breast milk rather than supplement their products with additional Mn when the products already have much higher Mn concentrations than breast milk.']"

Independently; both approaches detected dietary adaptations that differed between species. The comparative interpretation of the results from each method led to the following conclusions:\nHypothesis 1 (“All analyzed tritylodontid taxa subsisted on a predominantly herbivorous diet, i.e., primary and secondary food resources consist of living plants and/or shed plant parts”) is rejected. Both tooth wear approaches suggest a varied diet of plants and plant parts together with variable amounts of animal matter. We interpret that all ten tritylodontid taxa were opportunistic in their food choice.\nHypothesis 2 (“Body size had an influence on food choice”) is also rejected. Both tooth wear approaches were unable to detect a correlation of body size and food choice.\nVery low importance of exogenous effects was found for both tooth wear approaches, i.e., dust/grit contamination of food items.\nThe predominately fine wear features and low values of surface texture parameters make foraging for subterranean food items highly unlikely. If, however, food was harvested from underground sources, tritylodontids probably used their rodent-like incisors to break up the food item for reaching the softer inner parts.\nThe two tooth wear approaches are in conflict regarding the three species of Stereognathus: features are similar in all three species for 3D surface texture; however, stereoscopic microwear found contradicting features for Stereognathus sp. and S. sibiricus on one hand (consumption of soft to moderately tough food items), and S. ooliticus on the other hand (consumption of moderate to highly tough food items).\nWe summarize primary and secondary food resources in the analyzed taxa as follows:\n\nKayentatherium wellesi, Dinnebitodon amarali: Food items of moderate intrinsic toughness (mixed diet of softer seeds and soft- and/or hard-bodied insects)\nStereognathus sp. and Tritylodon longaevus: Food items of low to moderate intrinsic toughness (mixed diet of subaerial plant parts of heterogeneous anatomy and softer seeds); insects as a subsidiary food resource\nStereognathus sibiricus: Food items of low to moderate intrinsic toughness (mixed diet of seeds, cones, or other hard to leathery plant structures); insects as a subsidiary food resource; some influence of extrinsic factors\nStereognathus ooliticus: Food items of moderate to high intrinsic toughness (mixed diet of subaerial plant parts with tough coatings/bark and soft- and/or hard-bodied insects); note that this interpretation is based only on the results from stereoscopic microwear\nOligokyphus major, Oligokyphus sp. (GB), Oligokyphus sp. (US), Oligokyphus triserialis: Food items of low to moderate intrinsic toughness (mixed diet of plant reproductive structures including seeds and soft- and/or hard-bodied insects); but some influence of extrinsic factors in O. triserialis\n\nThe application of two independent methods of tooth wear analysis—differing with respect to magnification, parameters quantified and illumination—strengthens the results. These complementary methods facilitate a more detailed dietary reconstruction and functional interpretation for Tritylodontidae.\n']"

The ICER of US$24 for switching from invitation to food supplementation at the usual time in pregnancy and iron-folic acid supplementation to an early initiation of food supplementation combined with MMS can be considered affordable in a low-resource setting and viable from both a public health and economic perspective. These results can hopefully inspire others to consider multiple outcomes of nutritional interventions in economic evaluations and help to support decision-makers in the prioritizing of financing for nutrition interventions targeting pregnant women’s health.']

Children should be fed with diverse food groups including iron-rich foods according to WHO complementary feeding guidelines. Continued breastfeeding to age 2 and beyond should also be promoted. Since stunting begins in the prenatal period, nutritional promotion for pregnant mothers and early and regular ANC visits should be encouraged. While further prospective research is needed to determine the effect of feeding practices on linear growth, interventions such as iron supplementation and nutritional education programs could help prevent stunting and childhood anemia and might reduce their prevalence in Myanmar.']"

The present study shows that a high-calcium dairy based pre-exercise meal can reduce the exercise-induced rise in markers of bone resorption. This practice can easily be incorporated into the dietary routine of endurance cyclists and may help the athlete meet other sports nutrition recommendations. Future studies should use a long-term prospective design to confirm the efficacy of pre-exercise calcium intake for improving bone health in endurance cyclists.']"

As already observed by us and other authors, this risk of systematic perturbations may describe a syndrome due to incomplete feeding after the placenta nutrient flow disruption, the PI-ReFeeding syndrome. The effort to improve nutrition of premature infants has led many of us to focus primarily on the amount of AA and energy intake, thus in part underestimating the fundamental role of phosphorus and potassium for growth. This paper attempts a pragmatic approach to calculate the amount of phosphorus to be added in the PN bag, whilst not trying to provide the ideal intake, but rather aiming to avoid serious disturbances in the plasma concentrations of calcium and phosphate.']"

If salmon returns consistently decline in the future, grizzly bears that do not obtain enough salmon might experience chronically elevated cortisol and testosterone via increased nutritional and/or social stress, with unknown, but probably adverse, fitness costs. Moreover, our findings underscore the importance of considering implications for wildlife that share resources with humans as part of ecosystem-based fisheries management strategies [103], [104]. Ultimately, this work adds to a growing understanding of the value of measuring stress and reproductive measures in wildlife hair as indicators of broader population health and processes [8], [16], [19].']"

Here, we show a strong correlation between PCV and diet in two groups of primates, platyrrhines and prosimians, and that it performs as well or better than other topographical variables at predicting diet in Primates. Finally, we show how it is correlated to dental wear in a series of P. robustus teeth, and how it can be used to predict the parts of the tooth which will interact with the tooth, and, if the tooth has even low levels of wear, can be used to predict which parts of the tooth will wear further.']"

2019-05-22T00:00:00Z,Comparing the accuracy of PCR-capillary electrophoresis and cuticle microhistological analysis for assessing diet composition in ungulates: A case study with Pyrenean chamois,"['Taken together, our results suggest that PCR-CE combining the simultaneous amplification of two genes—long trnL(UAA) and ITS2—is a reliable technique for the determination of diet composition in herbivores. However, while this DNA-based method is qualitative in our experimental conditions, CMA can provide semi-quantitative data, since individual percentages of ingested plant species can be calculated, although a differential index of plant preservation should be taken into account. Additionally, the experimental conditions of outdoor exposure acted concomitantly with proper digestion processes to trigger genomic DNA degradation. Consequently and as expected, faeces freshness and preservation conditions are critical and determinant factors that compromise downstream DNA amplification efficiency but are not limiting in the case of CMA. We conclude that CMA and PCR-CE have both strong and weak features that make the two approaches complementary. Therefore, their simultaneous use can provide more complete, accurate and thorough information in diet composition studies. However, neither CMA nor PCR-CE seems to solve comprehensively the quatification of herbivore diets and thus further research needs to be done.']"
2018-10-10T00:00:00Z,"Dietary starch to lipid ratios influence growth performance, nutrient utilisation and carcass traits in broiler chickens offered diets with different energy densities","['In the present study, increasing nutrient density increased weight gain, decreased feed intake and improved feed conversion efficiency in broiler chickens from 7 to 27 days post-hatch. Lipid had a more pronounced impact on feed intake than dietary starch concentrations and as predicted in Fig 1, increasing dietary lipid concentrations from 25 to 75 g/kg depressed feed intake from 2350 to 2100 g/bird. Broiler chickens tended to consume to a constant protein intake because protein intake did not change with the protein proportions in the experimental diets. A surplus of energy derived from starch may increase carcass lipid concentrations and the balance between protein and energy is pivotal for optimal feed conversion and body protein deposition. Protein and energy need to be considered in tandem in practical diet formulation, as diets containing high crystalline amino acid inclusions with low crude protein contents may require a lesser energy expenditure along the digestive tract. The impact of lipid on pellet durability and feed intake and the impact of starch on carcass lipid concentrations should also be taken into consideration.']"
2013-09-11T00:00:00Z,Effects of Dietary Cooked Navy Bean on the Fecal Microbiome of Healthy Companion Dogs,"['This study evaluated the fecal microbiome of healthy pet dogs before and after 4 wk of feeding macro- and micronutrient-controlled diets containing either 0 or 25% dried navy bean powder. Few significant differences were observed in microbiome composition between 0 and 25% cooked navy bean treatments after 4 wk. Continued research on the microbial metabolic impacts of dietary dry bean intake in dogs undergoing weight loss and with chronic diseases that are similar to human conditions is warranted.Alterations in fecal microbial populations from baseline due to 4 wk dietary control macro- and micronutrient-controlled diets were noted. These data highlight the potential to alter microbial populations of pet dogs with diverse backgrounds and microbial populations in the same direction. The proportions of gastrointestinal microbes are altered in dogs with some diseases compared to healthy animals (e.g., acute hemorrhagic diarrhea, non-hemorrhagic diarrhea, and irritable bowel disease). Understanding the impacts of dietary changes on microbial populations in healthy dogs may help to treat or prevent these diseases in the future.The proportions of microbes are highly variable in pet dogs, which may impact the ability to detect differences when treatments are similar. Studies performed in pet dogs utilizing 454-pyrosequencing should attempt to decrease variation, or pair 454-pyrosequencing with targeted assays (e.g., qPCR, gene clone libraries, etc.). Variation would likely have been decreased in this study by utilizing a cross-over design, adapting animals to the control diet prior to baseline measurements, or selecting animals with more similar life histories (i.e., sex, breed, age, and previous diet).']"
2018-04-17T00:00:00Z,Metatranscriptome analysis of the microbial fermentation of dietary milk proteins in the murine gut,"['Here we show that prolonged feeding of high protein level diets for a period of 12 weeks exerted a prominent effect on the composition of caecal microbiota and its protein fermentation capacity, supporting elevated SCFA production in the caecal lumen as compared to fermentation of the alternative nutrients (i.e., cornstarch or fat). In addition, the data also revealed a prominent influence on the microbiota composition of the fat content in diets that contain normal protein levels. The microbial community members most active in the different diet groups belonged to the families of the Lachnospiraceae, Erysipelotrichaceae and Clostridiaceae, and were predicted to produce mainly acetate and butyrate based on the metatranscriptome profiles. The relative activity of especially the Erysipelotrichaceae appeared to be increased in mice consuming the high protein diets, although the Clostridiaceae expressed a wider range of different amino acid metabolism associated pathways. Moreover the total activity of the genes involved in these metabolites does not correspond to the concentration of acetate, propionate and butyrate measured in the caecum. So there is need for metabolite flux measurements, rather than luminal steady state concentrations. Furthermore a more complete reconstruction of the microbiome activity profiles is necessary to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of Erysipelotrichaceae and Clostridiaceae in the in situ fermentation of dietary protein. Such improved understanding would be strongly facilitated by pure and mixed in vitro culture studies using representatives of these microbial families to better characterize their metabolic repertoire and the genes involved in the relevant pathways, which would enable a more accurate metatranscriptome mapping. In conclusion, the data presented here provide clear metabolic indications concerning the microbial groups involved in protein catabolism in the intestine, but more complete understanding of the precise role of these microbes will require a better understanding of their physiological characteristics and may also require metatranscriptome datasets with a higher depth of analysis.']"

Our findings have implications for school-based interventions that aim to promote healthy eating habits. Our study shows that students are not motivated to take healthy foods on their plates and are on average wasting 76% of the food on their plates. With increasing rate of childhood obesity and diabetes, it is important to test and develop strategies that target school environmental factors that promote healthy dietary habits.Elementary school students are in an age of forming life-long habits. Policy makers and school officials need to work together to create an environment that would promote and foster healthy eating habits. This needs systematic approach in the form of long-term, multicomponent nutrition education programs.

In addition, our results indicated that the intention to consume and to purchase enriched bread can be maintained with levels < 12.17% and < 6.86% tilapia-waste flour, respectively.

The inhibitory effect of alginate beads appears to be linked to calcium; but as calcium is needed for a stable alginate gel to be formed low-calcium beads are not a viable alternative. However, with high phytate diets, it is possible that alginate might bind iron sufficiently tightly to protect it from binding to phytate (which prevents it being absorbed), and might therefore deliver a useful quantity of absorbable iron. This is the proposed action of iron-EDTA and it would be worth investigating whether alginate can perform a similar function.']"

The difference between Dorset and Beothuk settlement patterns identified archaeologically is reflected in the bioarchaeological data from skeletal remains affiliated with these cultures and can be attributed to real differences in subsistence practices. The Dorset located their settlements in the outer coastal regions of the island for the purpose of accessing migrating and local seal herds, while the Beothuk people employed a stable, generalized-marine adaptation that encompassed a wide range of predominantly marine species, but may have included terrestrial species as well. Our data show a marked change in Beothuk diet after the 18th century that likely corresponded to the withdrawal of the Beothuk from the coast in response to the presence of European settlers. We further noted some geographic variation that may relate to intensity of contact with Europeans. The stable isotope values from Beothuk after the 18th century indicate that while the Beothuk were able to access some marine foods, the general composition of the diet changed with implications for maintenance of traditional foodways.']"

Similarly, zebrafish gut microbiota may have been influenced: i) by the microbiota of H. illucens-based feed and ii) eventually by insect-derived bioactive compounds contained in the experimental diets. Indeed, as recently reported by Bruni et al. [57], the fish gut microbial community is plastic and can be influenced by insect-based feed. Moreover, the results of both PCR-DGGE and Illumina sequencing showed the presence of a core microbiota constantly associated with the zebrafish gut, irrespective of the diet.As highlighted by Huyben et al. [58], a high bacterial diversity can lead to improved health fish guts. Indeed, a rich microbial community could increase host resistance to pathogen invasion and intestinal infection. Hence, the low microbial richness exhibited by ZHC should be carefully considered when diets including HC are suggested.Further research is needed to understand the interactions among H. illucens microbiota, H. illucens bioactive compounds (i.e., chitin, polyphenols, etc.) and the zebrafish gut microbiota.Moreover, data collected on insect frass can be useful to widen the knowledge on such a poorly investigated insect rearing by-product for its further use.']"
2017-01-03T00:00:00Z,Effects of Protease Addition and Replacement of Soybean Meal by Corn Gluten Meal on the Growth of Broilers and on the Environmental Performances of a Broiler Production System in Greece,"['Reducing the protein concentration in the diets for broilers with the addition of protease enzyme or the substitution of SBM by CGM together with the use of a protease could be potential dietary strategies to lower feeding cost and improve the environmental impact of farming. This study showed that the group fed less SBM protein with the addition of protease, showed satisfactory performance and gut health characteristics. Also, the substitution of SBM by CGM together with a protease marginally retained growth performance parameters, affected positively the intestinal microflora of broiler chickens and retained gut integrity. Although the substitution of SBM by CGM marginally increased the feed cost, the overall feed cost per weight gain did not differ among the three groups. The reduction of SBM in feed inclusion at lower level along with protease or substitution of SBM by CGM and protease did not affect the chemical composition of broiler meat. In the current study, it was shown that it is possible to reduce SBM and feed crude protein content by the addition of protease enzyme. It was also shown that the substitution of SBM by CGM together with a protease enzyme is economically viable. However, further research is needed to investigate the relation of feed digestion and growth performance of broilers challenged with bacteria or protozoa that cause severe intestinal diseases.The LCA performed indicated that the N related emissions (NH3 and N2O) due to litter handling are the most important farm-level flows to be dealt with in order to reduce the acidification, eutrophication and global warming effects caused by the studied partial life-cycles. However, the number of the off-farm environmental hot-spots suggests that interventions in different parts of the production chain (especially in Latin American soybean production and domestic corn production and lignite mining processes) would be required for improvement of its environmental performance. This analysis further showed a potential decrease for the majority of the EICIs for the Gluten-Prot system in comparison to the conventional Control system. For most of these EICIs, this decrease was larger in the Gluten-Prot system than in the Soy-Prot system. Both the complete substitution of SBM and soybean oil and the increase in corn use (both for corn grain and CGM consumption) are regarded as the main cause of these reductions. This study finally suggests that the Gluten-Prot diet would provide an eco-friendly alternative to the Control diet of the specific system, if the water depletion during domestic corn and wheat production reduced and if electricity production in Greece became less dependent on lignite. In this study, LCA was used to provide deterministic values for the environmental impacts of the systems defined by the different diets tested which are regarded as initial, indicative figures on their environmental performance. Therefore, future LCA research should be focused on detecting and handling uncertainty issues regarding the environmental impacts of Greek broiler production processes in order to statistically support comparisons between the systems defined for different broiler diets.The maintenance of the broilers’ growth performance (body weight, feed intake and FCR), meat quality, feed cost per kg weight gain and gut integrity, the positive effect on the intestinal microflora and the potential reduction in the majority of the environmental impacts, could all be considered as positive indications in the effort to sustainably replace the conventional, soybean-dependent Control diet in the specific broiler production system. More research is required in order to identify alternative broiler diets with positive effects on broilers’ health and growth characteristics, the system’s economic performance, the broiler meat quality characteristics and all the EICIs, thus towards more sustainable Greek broiler production systems.']"

The dairy products modulated some common pathways during the postprandial phase, notably including various inflammatory or immune genes. The whole blood transcriptome appeared to be a sensitive surrogate marker of metabolic processes that showed coherence with established clinical biomarkers but also revealed subtle differences in the responses to the dairy products that were not captured by these biomarkers. The development of nutrition-specific genesets as well as the combined assessment of metabolomic with transcriptomic data could help better exploit this tool in the context of nutritional interventions. This approach nevertheless remains a promising method to complement classical biomarkers and metabolome evaluation to help better discriminate the metabolic responses to dietary intake in a healthy population.']"

Nutritional counselling and health education interventions of mothers followed by prompt feeding programs have to specifically focus on improving the health of the malnourished and anaemic. These, alongside continuous proper malaria-control measures of proven efficacy, may be apt to reduce the burden of malaria, anaemia, malnutrition and poverty on a large scale. This study therefore elucidates the interplay between the various health determinants and provides preliminary baseline data needed by policy makers, programme planners and implementers, non-governmental organizations, for strategic planning and implementation of the rapid scale-up of nutritional interventions as well as scaled-up malaria parasite control measures in the north region of Cameroon.']"
2015-05-27T00:00:00Z,The Contribution of Occult Precipitation to Nutrient Deposition on the West Coast of South Africa,"['The evidence presented indicates that deposition may be an important source of nutrients for Strandveld ecosystems. The flux of nutrients in rainfall in the wet winter months combined with inputs of HP, especially during the drier summers, suggests that atmospheric nutrient deposition may play a potentially important, year-around, role in plant nutrition at these sites. The depositional nutrient load and the ability of the vegetation to intercept and take up foliar deposition may explain why this vegetation is distinct floristically from neighboring Fynbos vegetation that occurs on less nutrient rich soils [79]. Although the relative lack of fire in Strandveld may also be important in determining vegetation structure, floristic characteristics and nutrition, we suggest that the name of this vegetation, meaning “beach vegetation” in Afrikaans, adequately describes the reason for the existence of this particular vegetation.']"

Yet, contextual barriers played a major role in limiting VHSNC capacity to improve local health, sanitation, and nutrition. Technical inputs that build community capacity are necessary but not sufficient. In order for VHSNCs to be sustainable mechanisms for community participation in health, they need to operate within more supportive contexts that go beyond the technical inputs. VHSNC capacity to navigate and respond to contextual barriers must be harnessed, while enabling environments for health committees must be nurtured through policy and resource allocation that supports local action and genuinely invests in rural health, sanitation and nutrition.']"

Our study supports our previous work with starved fire ant queens in that the sNPFR signaling may change in response to nutritional requirements, not only in queens but workers. To our knowledge this is the first if not one of the few studies with social insects that correlate body size, behavioral state and colony brood presence (proxy for colony nutritional status/requirements) with the actual protein expression of a brain neuropeptide receptor, sNPFR, and not a transcript. In the absence of brood, the overall decrease in the sNPFR signal observed in worker brains supports the idea that workers may be less motivated to search for food. It is apparent that in fire ant workers, similar to bees, changes in sNPFR expression depend at least partially on foraging needs.']"
2018-07-16T00:00:00Z,Impact of maternal nutritional supplementation in conjunction with a breastfeeding support program during the last trimester to 12 weeks postpartum on breastfeeding practices and child development at 30 months old,"['In summary, maternal milk supplementation from the last trimester to the first 12 weeks postpartum, coupled with a breastfeeding support program was significantly associated with prolonged EBF duration, increased EBF rate at 6 months, and reduced risk of early EBF cessation. The intervention also significantly improved child neurodevelopment in the domains of cognitive and motor functions at 30 months of age, when compared with the current standard care. The benefits of the maternal intervention on child neurodevelopment were partially mediated by higher birth weight but not EBF duration. This suggests that the prenatal nutritional supplementation may have played a more important role than the additional breastfeeding support given during the postnatal period in promoting neurodevelopment of the offspring. Future studies with a larger sample size are needed to examine the longer-term impacts of maternal nutritional supplementation on child growth and development.']"

It is also the first to assess the effect of these pregnancy interventions on child nutritional status after birth and the first to assess impact of cash transfer using an RCT design. We confirm others’ findings that provision of food, a fortified balanced energy protein supplement in our case, in pregnancy can increase birthweight, but evidence for the impact of cash transfers (7.5 USD/mo) is less clear. PLA alone did not increase birthweight substantially and did not attain significance.Provision of nutritious food supplements to pregnant women can increase the weight of babies at birth and may be more effective than provision of a modest amount of cash to buy additional food in pregnancy. However, in environments with very poor sanitation and hygiene, where infant and young child feeding behaviours are inadequate, gains in weight resulting from pregnancy interventions are not sustained, which suggests that nutrition interventions in pregnancy may need to continue beyond pregnancy until at least 2 years of age. Further studies comparing the effects of food and cash and assessing the impact of PLA on birthweight and child nutrition are needed, as are studies evaluating the long-term impacts on health of increases in birthweight.']"
2016-01-25T00:00:00Z,Global Expanded Nutrient Supply (GENuS) Model: A New Method for Estimating the Global Dietary Supply of Nutrients,"['The GENuS model provides a new and detailed method to estimate supplies of key micro- and macronutrients globally, based on 225 food commodities within 152 countries over the past 50 years. This model also allows better estimation of heterogeneity in global nutrition by analyzing nutrient supplies across 34 age and sex groups. Because this method calculates nutrient supplies down to the individual food group, it is a more powerful tool for calculating how changes in access to particular foods or changes of nutrient composition of those foods would potentially impact intake of specific nutrients for target populations and the overall adequacy of their nutrition. This not only allows researchers or policymakers to find those most vulnerable for nutrient deficiency or malnutrition, but also to know which foods supply those nutrients, and which countries would be vulnerable to changes in production or access to these foods. For example, GENuS can allow, for the first time, robust estimation of the nutrient supply consequences of varying threats to different foods due to climate change, soil degradation, drought, loss of pollinators, and other modern challenges. By using food supply data over the past half-century, we have the unique ability to attain nearly global coverage to measure worldwide trends. Because of its scope and detail, the GENuS model can provide a useful and versatile method for monitoring global nutrition and health in a rapidly changing world.']"

The literature readily acknowledges the contribution that the SF trade has on the economy but fails to explore how one could go about improving the trade and growing the vendors’ knowledge and skills. This research study thus embarked on developing a SFVM that would entail nutrition, hygiene and safety, and business and operational aspects of street-food vending. This was done within a socio-ecological framework, which considers an individual as part of a greater whole. Important elements such as the individual’s physical environment, the policy environment and also basics such as the individual’s knowledge and ‘support’ environment is considered.This proposed SFVM will hopefully be taken forward, piloted, and adapted as needed to improve the SF-vending trade. Eventually it is endeavoured to not only make the SF trade more lucrative, the vendor more knowledgeable and aware, but also to make the product sold a healthier one. In turn, this should improve the overall nutrition and health of consumers who frequently purchase SF.\nLimitations\nAlthough this was a mixed-methodology study, which enabled a broader contextual appreciation, understanding the vending operation from the ground (the vendor) as well as from the user (the consumer) and from a regulatory point of view (government/municipal officials).

Women’s tolerance to domestic violence in Odisha was a concern and needs to be addressed through NRLM or other social welfare platforms. Along with increasing SHG membership, need for improving reach of food security schemes or nutri-sensitive livelihoods is needed across all states. The gains in women’s financial control are yet to translate in improving their nutritional status across all states. SHG membership has varying influence in use of antenatal, partum and family planning services across Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. Services that require increased attention across all states include pregnancy registration in first trimester, height measurement of pregnant women, increased information and access to family planning methods and participation in VHSNDs. In Bihar, reach of all ANC services excluding TT vaccination need to be reviewed. The need for layering essential women’s nutrition interventions that is access to health services and care to nutritionally “at risk”, access to family planning services, improving dietary diversity, preventing micronutrient deficiencies and anemia and access to water, sanitation and hygiene services is immense. The context supports an inititaivet like Swabhimaan to layer these nutrition interventions on the NRLM platforms. This may be more effective in a state like Bihar where nearly half the SHGs have federated to VOs.']"

Under laboratory conditions, the color and shape parameters were acquired from the scanned images of rice leaves and sheaths. Then, SVFS was used to select the optimal characteristics set for the identification of NPK deficiencies, and Fisher discriminant analysis was used to build the diagnosis model.Compared with traditional methods, hierarchical identification can be used to effectively build the targeted identification rules for each nutrition deficiency. Finally, to improve the accuracy of the identification, this research introduced hierarchical identification. In this research, the identification process was divided into three hierarchies. First, the normal and non-normal (NPK deficiencies) samples were identified. In this hierarchy the selected characteristics were LSR, LSG, LSB, LSL, LTR, LTG, LA and LG. In the second hierarchy, N deficiency and PK deficiencies were identified. In this hierarchy the selected characteristics were LSG, LSB, WRA, LB, and LG. Finally, P deficiency and K deficiency were identified. In this hierarchy the selected characteristics were LG, LSL, A/L, LTG, L23, LSG, and LI.The result showed that hierarchical identification can be used to effectively improve the accuracy of identification (86.15, 87.69, 90.00 and 89.23% for the 4 growth stages). Data representing different years were used for validation, and the validation accuracies were 83.08, 83.08, 89.23 and 90.77% for the 4 growth stages.The study provides evidence for the quick diagnosis of rice nutrient status, which makes it possible to accurately identify rice NPK deficiencies with scanning technology. Other crops, such as maize and wheat, suffering nutrition deficiencies usually exhibit some special symptoms on the leaves and sheaths, and this method can be used to diagnose their nutrition level status. Therefore, the technology introduced in the study has application value and development potential.']"

Observations of altered measures of metabolism in carriers of expanded HTT CAG alleles, as well as in individuals with these alleles who exhibit overt clinical symptoms, strongly support the hypothesis that HTT is a negative regulator of cellular energy levels in a manner that is modulated by the size of the CAG tract. These energetic changes may contribute early in the disease process, either as a causative factor or as a compensatory response. The results of our systematic analysis of several hundred metabolites across a panel of tissues clearly demonstrated that single Htt CAG expansion allele, expressed at endogenous levels, is sufficient to induce significant changes in the concentration of metabolites in a number of tissues in adult mice after chronic metabolic stress. These changes are largely tissue-specific and are most pronounced in the striatum, as judged by the number of altered metabolites, but are observed to varying degrees in a number of non-brain tissues. Interestingly, again judged by numbers of metabolites affected, the response of the striatum to the CAG repeat allele was about on par with the response of liver tissue and plasma to the different high fat diet stressors. In the mutant striatum and mutant striatal cells, the accumulation of diverse lipid species provides a novel striatal-specific metabolite signature. A limitation of our study is that we did not perform metabolic profiling in HdhQ111 mice under a baseline standard diet that would have allowed comparing the metabolic changes induced by the diet itself. However, our study revealed differential responses to related high fat-diet stressors, which encourages study designs that include a perturbation arm. Indeed, a number of the metabolite changes elicited by the CAG expansion mutation in knock-in mice are amenable to follow up study in HD patients and may serve as readily detectible markers of various aspects of the early pathogenic process.']"

The species diversity increased sward productivity and persistence and the presence of one legume species, lucerne, considerably influenced yield under the cutting regime. Moreover, a greater species diversity in the forage mixture reduced invasibility by unsown species. However, these advantages depend on the cutting or grazing strategy since all forbs and legumes were reduced by continuous grazing.

This seems to suggest that the impact of risk exposures on language start early in life. Among the older children we found that HAZ (a putative, but widely used index of children’s early nutritional environment [3]), inflammation (repeatedly elevated CRP over the first year of life), and the family caregiving environment each independently contributed to variation in children’s developmental outcomes 36 and 60 months.

In addition, RBCs significantly promoted the expression of reproduction-related genes in paired female worms cultured in vitro. Yet, the in vitro developed female schistosomes were not fully matured, for their eggs were still infertile. Understanding the nutritional requirements for schistosome reproductive development can be expected to aid optimization of in vitro culture methods for these parasites, and provide insights for innovative ways for treatment of schistosomiasis.']"

Although this study was conducted under controlled conditions, field experiments have been conducted demonstrating the same synergistic effect of N on Zn uptake and accumulation in cereals grains, supporting the hypothesis that effective Zn biofortification of wheat grain is provided by the judicious application of both N and Zn fertilizer. The genotypes analyzed in the experiment reported here showed large contrasts in their partitioning of biomass and Zn between plant parts. Since there was no negative relationship between grain yield and grain Zn concentration or content, it might be possible combine the greater grain yield of the Quartzo genotype with the better Zn partitioning in the BRS Parrudo genotype to deliver a greatly improved genotype. This would be a significant advance for the biofortification of wheat for human nutrition.']"

Se positively promoted C. vulgaris growth at lower concentrations (≤75 mg L−1), acting as an antioxidant through the inhibition of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). The antioxidative effect was associated with an increase in guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and photosynthetic pigments. Meanwhile, significant increase in the cell growth rate and organic Se content was also detected in the algae. Se is an essential micronutrient in the diet of many organisms, including humans and significant health benefits have been attributed to it. Due to its enhanced bioavailability, Se is essential both in biomedicine and complementary diet of domestic animals. The Se-Chlorella may be developed as antioxidative functional foods for aquaculture and human health.']"

Caution should be exercised when attempting to generalize our results to humans. Non-dietary factors, such as stress, insufficiency of physical activity, lack of involvement/withdrawal from life activities, depressive symptoms common in obese humans may underpin the link between human obesity and neurodegenerative disease in old age may mediate the link between excessive caloric intake, high fat diet, obesity and poorer cognitive performance in humans. Prospective studies designed to evaluate the long-term effects of mild ketonemia on the brain and its function are necessary.']"

The study greatly increased our knowledge of prey caught by the southern African population of greater crested terns during the breeding season, offering new insights into the relationships between predators and prey in the Benguela upwelling region. Flexible foraging strategies are often the most effective short-term responses to climate change and may buffer predators against the uncertainty of locating food in a stochastic and exploited system such as the Benguela region [28]. In such areas, due to their restricted foraging range when breeding and the availability of a real-time monitoring method with limited sampling effort and disturbance [86], greater crested terns may be important ocean sentinels indicating localized human-induced alterations in common and non-commercialized species. The non-invasive method used in this study offers a fine-scale window into their diet and behaviour that can be implemented to undertake systematic and detailed monitoring of changes in the availability of prey in the vicinity of breeding colonies. Comprehensive long-term diet studies will contribute to our understanding of how greater crested terns cope with the apparent variation in food availability better than other seabird species relying on the same primary food resource and breeding in the same marine ecosystem.']"

2018-02-08T00:00:00Z,Towards a novel model for studying the nutritional stage dynamics of the Colombian population by age and socioeconomic status,"['To the best of our knowledge this study constitutes the first assessment of the SES-related obesity dynamics in a LMIC using a complex systems approach. We proposed a heuristic to estimate the TRs and a population-level SD model to assess and model the nutritional stage dynamics of an urban population by age and SES, over time. The TR indicators were constructed, and this study constitutes the first use of these indicators to provide information regarding the fraction of individuals who move between BMI categories stratified by age and SES.The model results, which have implications for the targeting of interventions in Colombia, indicate that the most vulnerable and poorest groups display higher TRs to overweight and obese, whereas wealthiest groups show the highest prevalences of overweight and obesity. Despite this, the main public health policies in Colombia targeting the lowest SES population are related to undernutrition and integrated policies for the whole spectrum of malnutrition are not effectively implemented. We also found that the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children aged 0 to 14 years do not follow the patterns observed in other middle income countries in Latin America.The model proposed in this paper offers policymakers a useful tool to better monitor nutritional transitions among diverse segments of the population. In particular, the model could be employed to estimate the TRs between BMI categories by age and SES, and to help identify which subgroups of the population should be targeted. The model could also be used to monitor the impact of health interventions implemented to prevent the development of overweight and obesity related to age and SES. Finally, with proper adaptations this model could be used for assessing SES-related nutritional transitions in other LMICs.']"

Since the greater is the variability for an individual trait, the greater the opportunity for genetic improvement by plant breeders, the next phase of the research will focus on creating new germplasm with increased nutritional quality. Potential parents for use in breeding programs can be chosen from the surveyed material among the inbred lines with seeds containing the least amount of C-GFs.In addition, last but not least, we also produced molecular data regarding phytic acid pathway and showed which genes are more relevant for phytic acid biosynthesis in the seeds. These results together with a preliminary analysis of pearl millet orthologous genes for C-glycosylflavones biosynthesis open the way to dissect the genetic determinants controlling key seed nutritional phenotypes and to the characterization of their impact on grain nutritional value in pearl millet.']"
2015-06-15T00:00:00Z,Identification of Relevant Phytochemical Constituents for Characterization and Authentication of Tomatoes by General Linear Model Linked to Automatic Interaction Detection (GLM-AID) and Artificial Neural Network Models (ANNs),"['Both methods developed, GLM-AID and ANN, have selected different nutritional parameters. The AID analysis does not provide a function that measures the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable. However, the AID analysis can be used with other statistical techniques to complete the analysis and determine the relative importance of the different independent variables. In comparison, the ANN creates a function and certain relationships among variables that are more affective in the approximation to each output variable allowing a prediction, more or less accurate, for each output studied variable.GLM-AID has identified the most significant chemical parameters linked to the harvest date and the production system, and even associated to same tomato cultivars, which can be considered as the main significant differences among tomato samples.GLM-AID showed that weather conditions have the main influence on the chemical composition of tomatoes followed by the effect of the production system. Once identified those chemical parameters, the tomato cultivars were not sequentially segmented. It can be due to a similar nutritional composition of the tomatoes cultivars.The ANN models showed different results, where the percentage of classification according to harvest date was 100%, slightly reduced for the production system with 93.8%, and finally the lowest percentage, 50%, for the tomato cultivar. One possible explanation is that the nutritional parameters are not suitable for the identification or classification of tomato cultivars so other kind of markers should be considered. Nevertheless, the combination of GLM-AID and ANN models can be useful to reduce experimental time and cost, personal costs, allowing the use of this predictive models in food fraud detection.']"

Failure to meet these three ROB domain criteria greatly increased the likelihood of a neutral or negative quality rating.Over time, the percentage of published research that meets the ROB domain criteria (lower risk of bias) has steadily increased with the exception of Performance, which only began improvement in 2000. There were a few instances in which non-government-only funding was a significant predictor of whether there was a higher risk of bias for Selection when compared to government funding and there were also a few instances where non-government-only funding predicted less risk of bias for Detection and Attrition. However, research design and publication year were more consistent predictors of ROB domain ratings in food and nutrition research.There was surprisingly little overlap (10%) and very high consistency in the ROB domain ratings for the research articles with more than one critical appraisal record. The largest overlap was between the EAL and NEL, where there was extremely high agreement in the ROB domain ratings.These results support focusing on the three ROB domains that can be strengthened, and they allow the food and nutrition research community to focus on constructive ways to improve the overall body of research rather than investigate source of funding as the primary predictor of ROB. This research sets the stage for establishing initiatives to support or create research environments that enhance rigor of research and demand research integrity.']"

2019-02-13T00:00:00Z,Prenatal maternal docosahexaenoic acid intake and infant information processing at 4.5mo and 9mo: A longitudinal study,"['Putting together the findings from all of the tasks in this study, and considering them in relation to the inconsistent pattern of findings from previous research, it is impossible to conclude, with any reasonable degree of certainty, whether or not higher intake of DHA (either maternally during pregnancy or breastfeeding, or via infant postnatal levels) promotes better infant cognitive development. This view is supported by the most recent Cochrane reviews[43,44] reporting that, on balance, the current published empirical evidence does not support the theory of higher DHA levels resulting in better infant cognitive development (in infants born at term). Despite the number of positive studies reporting such a link, routine maternal supplementation and/or addition of DHA to infant formula should not be recommended at this time based on purported cognitive outcomes.We also note that even in the case of visual acuity the effect we report is only apparent at 9 months post-partum, not at 4.5 months, when it may be expected that any differences between individuals may be more apparent. It is important to be aware that this may be a common feature in studies examining the impact of nutritional factors on development; namely, that the findings appear to be transient. However, this does not necessarily mean that they are any less important. Significant transient effects may well have consequences throughout the developmental course that are not initially apparent. Furthermore, transient findings support the rationale of considering examination of nutrient levels at more than one time point during pregnancy. Specific nutrients appear to have a critical point of action on the developing brain, likely related to the specific development within a particular cognitive system occurring at the time.Finally, we feel it is with caution that findings of studies such as this are translated into advice for pregnant women regarding their diet and supplement choices. At the moment there appears to be no conclusive, unequivocal evidence to support the recommendation that pregnant women increase DHA levels for the purpose of optimising postnatal cognitive development in their infant. This is not to say that there may not be other, evidence based, reasons to do this (for example, in relation to allergy development; or for maternal cardiovascular health), however, in the case of cognitive or visual development10, the empirical support for higher prenatal intake is still lacking.']"
2017-11-08T00:00:00Z,Obesity and the burden of health risks among the elderly in Ghana: A population study,"['This paper contributes new knowledge on aging and international health with particular emphasis on elderly obesity and health risks. The paper’s scholarly contribution is four-fold. First, prior studies have focused on the disparate effects of obesity on hypertension, arthritis, functional disability and cognitive impairment, with special emphasis on youth cohorts. This study examines these health risks associated with obesity among the elderly in the context of a developing country. The cultural context of Ghana and the multilevel effects of these health risks make the findings compelling and the policy implications important. Increasing life expectancy and ageing trends call for health policies and planning together to accommodate chronic health conditions for the elderly population. The likely coexistence of elderly obesity with hypertension and other chronic conditions such as arthritis, angina, and diabetes implies attention to chronic conditions among the obese elderly must collectively focus on all possible risk factors.Second, the factors influencing the transition from stage 1 to stage 2 hypertension have rarely been examined in the existing literature. This paper fills that gap by distinguishing between the risk of stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension, the latter being significant for clinical and medical practice. When diagnosed early, the elderly who are stage 1 hypertensive have the chance to make behavioral changes that could avert future medical complications or early mortality due to stage 2 hypertension.Third, this study identifies factors such as physical activity that could potentially mediate the effects of obesity on health risks among the elderly. By doing so, our findings underscore the need for nutritional interventions and other prevention strategies to reduce the health risks associated with obesity. This is particularly important now because urbanization and shifts toward more sedentary lifestyles and diets rich in fat, sugar, and animal-based protein in developing nations increase susceptibility to obesity.Finally, this study points to the need to address the social determinants of health as a critical intervention to ensure the economic and socially disadvantaged in society do not disproportionately carry the burden of these health risks. The multiple health risks associated with obesity among the elderly in Ghana and elsewhere in SSA make it a public health concern that needs to be addressed through the right policies, educational campaigns, and interventions.']"

The results indicated that parents in Taiwan cannot choose the healthiest foods for their children by simply focusing on food claims. They must pay closer attention to the nutrition facts, particularly the sodium and sugar content. Pediatric physicians, dietitians, and health professionals should educate parents on how to interpret the information on food packaging so that they can choose the foods that are truly most suitable for their children’s healthy development. Given that few data for Taiwan’s commercial CFs are available, the results of this study should be useful to health professionals. Furthermore, the Taiwan government should regulate the labeling of nutrition facts and food claims for foods targeted at infants younger than 12 months.']"

In this study we compared the gut microbiota of age matched chicken and guinea fowls with no history of disease housed in similar condition and fed identical diets. Thus, the specific bacterial profile differences reported here have largely resulted from the host and microbe interactions. This study provides a basic reference for the gut microbiome of both chickens and Guinea fowls and provides the first comprehensive study of the microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract of Guinea fowls. Our findings demonstrate that the presence of Verrucomicrobia and Lentisphaerae in the guinea fowl GIT is a point of differentiation between the two species.

A Study in Two Close C57Bl/6 Substrains,"['Our study raises the question of the true absence of BP phenotype in non salt sensitive mice usually described in the literature and suggest that all experiments assessing the effect of salt on BP should: 1) use chronic aorta catheterization to assess BP, and 2) be carried out in the active phase of the animals i.e. during the nocturnal period. Therefore for practical reasons we have shown that these nocturnal animals can be placed under a reversed dark/light cycle without affecting their response to the HS diet. Finally, HS/LK diet amplifies the effect of the HS challenge in C57BL/6J only. Thus, while C57BL6/N background is appropriate to assess the effect of sodium on BP, one should consider that the response to HS/low potassium on this genetic background might not be adequate for the evaluation of translational comparisons to other species and humans. These accurate experimental conditions are an essential prerequisite to the experimental investigation of salt-induced hypertension in mice.']"

The results underscored the adverse implications of low availability of large-sized supermarkets in poor and less urban areas as well as high prevalence of western fast food restaurants in high urbanized areas. To improve access to healthy foods and allow consumers to make informed choices, public health officials may pursue the appropriate measures as mentioned above. In addition, description of area differences in the local food environment is an important step to understand disparities and social inequalities in health. Thus, future research will need to map a more accurate description of local food environment and then move beyond descriptive studies to investigations of the causality in the association between the availability of various food resources and residents’ diets and diet-related health outcomes.']"
2015-07-29T00:00:00Z,The Evolution of Stomach Acidity and Its Relevance to the Human Microbiome,"['We demonstrate that stomach acidity increases with the risk of food-borne pathogen exposure and propose that the stomach plays a significant role as an ecological filter and thus a strong selection factor in gut microbial community structure and primate evolution in particular. In light of modern lifestyle changes in diet, hygiene and medical interventions that alter stomach pH, we suggest that stomach acidity in humans is a double-edged sword. On one hand, the high acidity of the human stomach prevents pathogen exposure but it also decreases the likelihood of recolonization by beneficial microbes if and when they go missing. However, in those cases where acidity is reduced, the gut is more likely to be colonized by pathogens. Though it is widely discussed in both the medical and ecological literature, data on pH are actually very scarce. Thus, to fully understand the patterns highlighted here more detailed studies on the gut microbiota across stomach acidities and diet are required.']"

Gene expression analysis showed that although β-cryptoxanthin histochemically reduced steatosis, it was more effective in inhibiting inflammatory gene expression change in NASH. In fact, β-Cryptoxanthin reduced the induction of markers of macrophages, T helper cells, and cytotoxic T cells. The expression of LPS-inducible and/or TNFα-inducible genes was suppressed by β-cryptoxanthin, probably via the inhibition of macrophage activation. Thus, β-cryptoxanthin suppresses inflammation and subsequent fibrosis primarily by suppressing the increase and activation of macrophages and other immune cells. Reduction of oxidative stress is likely to be a major mechanism of suppression of inflammation and injury in the livers of mice with NASH. Our results provide an important clue to elucidate the molecular mechanism of alleviation effect of β-cryptoxanthin on CL diet-induced NASH.']"

In particular, the isolated supplementation of the maternal diet with oligofructose (10%) seems to activate the LPS-mediated TLR4 pathway. In contrast, high oligofructose supplementation with hydrogenated vegetable fat during pregnancy and lactation triggered inflammatory tissue-specific responses in the offspring, likely through the activation of the TLR4 pathway but independent of the elevation in the pup’s serum endotoxin levels, increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production and decreased the adiponectin levels. It is still precipitate the generalization of present findings to other animal species, including humans. Further studies should investigate the dose-response effect of oligofructose supplementation during pregnancy and lactation on the development, metabolism, endotoxemia and inflammatory mechanisms in pups.']"

Because tannic acid containing diets are not consumed by animals incapable of upregulating PRPs [32], [33], we believe that the correlational relationship observed here is likely causal in nature. Our findings support and extend the work done by Glendinning [33] and Dsamou et al. [23] suggesting that salivary proteins can alter taste-guided ingestive responses. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that salivary proteins are involved in modulating both the orosensory and the postingestive feedback associated with chronic exposure to tannic acid diets. Understanding how the differential expression of these and other salivary proteins can modulate taste perception and the processing of postingestive signals represents a novel approach toward identifying individual differences in bitter taste acceptance.']"

The fact that these genes are PPARG-targets in non-ruminants suggests that, similar to non-ruminant species, the bovine PPARG receptor in dairy cow also is TZD-responsive. Hence, as suggested in previous studies, targeting PPARG during late-pregnancy through early lactation when insulin concentration and sensitivity decreases might be a practical tool to prevent excessive losses in body condition.']"

Our results show that the anuran species studied are not specialists of specific types of food but rather opportunistic herbivores and/or detritivores. However, despite some degree of niche partitioning, the species studied were at the same time capable of exploiting a variable proportion of different food resources (algae, zooplankton, macrophytes, detritus), depending on the ecological scenarios. Thus, which food source predominates in each species’ diet is largely conditioned by both intraspecific and interspecific competition, whereas we found little evidence for non-consumptive, trait-mediated predator effects. Changes in diet due to different ecological interactions have direct or indirect consequences on the local structure of an ecosystem, as the food web interactions are also likely to be altered. The observed shifts in the amphibians’ diet in response to environmental changes demonstrate that amphibians are greatly affected by intraspecific density, interspecific competition, and invasive species. This ability of amphibian larvae to alter their trophic niche depending on the ecological scenario may be determinant in their capacity for exploiting widely divergent or fluctuating conditions in the large array of aquatic systems they inhabit. Such shifts in the trophic niche of larval amphibians may strongly affect the structure and dynamics of the food web of temporary ponds, especially if such changes occur at a fast rate due to the introduction of invasive species or other factors causing rapid declines of amphibian populations.']"

Further research needs also to account for consumer behaviors to understand how and why individuals would opt for products with improved nutrient profiles and how to guide them towards these options. Cultural backgrounds play a key role in food selection, and there is strong need to assess which population could benefit most from food reformulation, and which food categories should be prioritized.']"
2015-04-21T00:00:00Z,Research Priorities to Improve the Management of Acute Malnutrition in Infants Aged Less Than Six Months (MAMI),"['The management of acute malnutrition in infants <6m (MAMI) is a critical area for child health and nutrition; prioritising research is important for making the biggest advances as quickly as possible. Our results suggest the need for a broad approach spanning basic epidemiology, health policies and systems, and more specialist interventions. Fundamental questions, such as how to define SAM in infants <6m, are most urgent. Other priorities include research on how to integrate MAMI into existing programmes and practices; how to provide appropriate breastfeeding support; and how to assess treatment coverage. The 2013 WHO SAM guidelines create an important stimulus to action. Our CHNRI builds on this by informing global efforts and providing technical direction on an agreed-on and transparent operational research agenda: maximising opportunities, avoiding duplication of effort and waste of resources, and designing research that will most effectively inform policy change and front-line practice. All ultimately lead to MAMI treatments with the biggest possible impact on infant <6m mortality, morbidity, and nutrition.']"
2019-12-09T00:00:00Z,Using morphological attributes for the fast assessment of nutritional responses of Buddhist pine (Podocarpus macrophyllus [Thunb.] D. Don) seedlings to exponential fertilization,"['In this study, Buddhist pine seedlings were raised at a range of EF rates from 0 to 140 mg N seedling-1 in multishelves for which most environmental factors were highly controlled. Seedlings were determined to have different nutrient statuses with different growth, morphology, biomass, and nutrient response parameters. According to the changes associated with these parameters, the nutritional responses of Buddhist pine seedlings were graded into statuses of deficiency, luxury consumption, and toxicity in response to dose-ranges of 0–60 mg N seedling-1, 60–120 N seedling-1 and over 120 N seedling-1, respectively. Morphological traits, GCI and LA, obtained by digital analysis also had significant responses to the range of EF doses, but only LA had a positive relationship with most nutritional parameters. Therefore, a dose range between 60 and 120 mg N seedling-1 was recommended for the culture of Buddhist pine seedlings, and leaf area assessment through digital scanning can be used as an easy and fast approach for indicating inherent nutrient status.']"

The effect of long term vegan, ovo-lacto vegetarian or omnivore diets on the prevalence of erythromycin-resistant LAB and their genes in the human gut was studied. Eleven different species of erythromycin-resistant LAB from Enterococcus and Streptococcus genera were recovered from the fecal samples obtained from each dietary group, showing that diet did not significantly affect the occurrence of erythromycin-resistant bacteria in the human gut. However, LAB isolates from omnivores were resistant to a greater number of tested antibiotics compared to isolates from ovo-lacto vegetarians and vegans. This could be related to the extensive use of antibiotics in farm animals for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes. Finally, the ability of commensal MDR strains to transfer resistance genes in vitro is of great concern since they may act as reservoirs of AR genes and be the source of their spreading to other strains, including human pathogens.']"
2019-08-28T00:00:00Z,"Dietary inulin alters the gut microbiome, enhances systemic metabolism and reduces neuroinflammation in an APOE4 mouse model","['In this study, we detail how a dietary intervention with inulin, a prebiotic, can effectively alter the gut microbiome in a preclinical AD mouse model, enhance systemic metabolic functions and reduce brain inflammation characteristic of early AD. We focus on the underlying metabolic features contributed by the APOE ε4 genotype, the largest risk factor for the development of AD, and show how dietary inulin intervention can mitigate them. This represents a shift in AD research, from the amyloid hypothesis to the metabolic features underlying the disease. As impairment of energy metabolism and elevation of neuroinflammation are well-established features of AD, a prebiotic-rich diet might be a potentially useful approach to prevent the onset of the disease. For future studies, it will be important to establish whether an inulin-enriched diet can inhibit Aβ aggregation and impede cognitive decline in symptomatic E4FAD mice. Understanding the dietary effects in the context of the gut-brain axis may have significant future implications for preventing AD in asymptomatic APOE4 carriers.']"
2017-06-19T00:00:00Z,Effects of obesogenic diet and estradiol on dorsal raphe gene expression in old female macaques,"['Throughout this report, we have referred to an E-induced increase in gene expression. While this is an accurate description of the histograms, it is physiologically more plausible that gene expression decreased with OvH or Ovx and that E-treatment maintained optimum expression. An obesogenic diet for 2.5 years in old surgically menopausal macaques blunted or increased variability in E-induced gene expression in the dorsal raphe. In addition, the overall expression of many of the genes was lower in the WSD-fed compared to the chow-fed females. The loss of E-regulation of pivotal amyloid protein processing enzymes, as well as lack of proper synapse assembly, DNA repair, protein degradation, protein folding and transport functions suggests that HT may not be as beneficial to neural function and viability in obese women compared to normal weight women; and that WSD with obesity could foster development of Alzheimer’s disease. However, the serotonin-related genes maintained some responsiveness to E treatment with the obesogenic diet.']"
2019-05-20T00:00:00Z,Effect of ocean acidification on the nutritional quality of marine phytoplankton for copepod reproduction,"['The copepod A. tonsa showed impaired reproductive ability when fed a diet of high-pCO2 phytoplankton with reduced EFA and PUFA, suggesting that fecundity of A. tonsa may decrease under future OA conditions. Based on our results using R. salina and S. marinoi, cryptophytes and diatoms were more susceptible to decreases in their cellular EFA content due to increasing pCO2, whereas the response for the tested dinoflagellate P. micans varied between the two experiments. OA-induced changes in phytoplankton EFA content appears to be species-dependent and may inhibit copepod productivity through altering the lipids available for copepod egg production, egg hatching success, and naupliar survival. Most previous studies that have investigated the direct effects of OA on copepods have found copepods to be widely resilient to future-predicted OA conditions, whereas our study demonstrates that copepods were indirectly affected by OA through changes in the availability of EFAs in their planktonic diets.']"
2018-01-11T00:00:00Z,Obesogenic diets alter metabolism in mice,"['In summary, we found significant global metabolic alterations in the lung, distinct from those found in the liver and kidney. These results establish the lung as organ affected by diet and the metabolic derangements of obesity. Pathways of significantly altered metabolites emerged in the lung, some with commonalities between obese groups and others showing varying changes. We report alterations in metabolites of the TCA cycle, antioxidant and nucleotide pathways as described in detail above. The lung lipidome showed significant changes in neutral lipids, fatty acids, phospholipids and sphingolipids. These differences suggest possible mechanisms by which metabolic changes induced by obesity could alter lung physiology. The significant changes in obese lungs highlight the altered state of the un-challenged obese lung and could provide mechanisms by which diet influences disease progression. Many metabolites significantly altered in this study have not been reported previously in the lung and it is therefore clear more research on the metabolic role of the lung is needed to better understand the impact of these changes.']"
2015-01-28T00:00:00Z,In Vitro Study and Comparison of Caecal Methanogenesis and Fermentation Pattern in the Brown Hare (Lepus europaeus) and Domestic Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus),"['Hare caecal microflora produce less methane and a lower total SCFA concentration compared with the rabbit. Because the caecal methane production of hares appears to be very low in the presence of the supplementary wheat bran substrate, we may hypothesise that this depends more on local microflora than on access to fodder. Moreover, the caecal fermentation pattern of hares is characterised by higher propionate and isobutyrate levels than observed in rabbit caecum. This could be a result of the slightly different diets and digestive physiologies of these two species; however, these results also suggest differences in the microbial populations that inhabit their caeca. Thus, to explain these questions, further research is required on the hare caecal microflora and their activity. Because the addition of the substrate made some of the parameters in the hare caecum approach those in the rabbit caecum without affecting methanogenesis, further studies on hares and rabbits fed the same diet could elucidate the impact of food on the differences between these species.']"

Osbeck (Sweet Orange),"['The phloem sap of sweet orange is rich in sugars, amino acids, and organic acids. In general, all the metabolites detected and their percentages in phloem sap collected by EDTA exudation were similar to the sap collected by centrifugation. However, the centrifugation method allowed us to estimate the concentrations of different compounds. The percentages of chemical groups using the different derivatization methods are presented in Figure 4A–C. Most of the metabolites found in phloem sap are also detected in citrus juice; thus, it is not surprising that the addition of citrus orange juice to the culture medium prolonged the viability of CLas [53]. The phloem sap is considered an excellent diet for phloem-sap feeders because it is predigested, rich in sugars and amino acids, and it is free of toxins and feeding deterrents [2]. This study revealed aspects of the nutrient composition of the citrus phloem sap that could contribute to the cultivation of CLas and formulation of an artificial diet system for phloem sap-sucking insects that attack citrus.']"
2019-11-21T00:00:00Z,Socioeconomic determinants of nutritional status among ‘Baiga’ tribal children In Balaghat district of Madhya Pradesh: A qualitative study,"['As for the Baigas, the introduction of so-called ‘developmental policies’ of the government disrupted their self-reliant traditional ways of life and left them at the vagaries of the state. Their culture celebrated and fostered their close bond with the nature at the same time also emphasizing communal ownership and communal consumption, closely-knit kinship structures and minimal hierarchies. A deep-seated perception in India is that tribes are primitive communities with little or no order in society, and the developmental policies are therefore directed towards making them more civilized and socio-culturally evolved. Obviously, such a view is a product of the dominant culture’s prejudice against, and ignorance of, the culture of both settled and nomadic tribal peoples, particularly those deemed primitives, since each of these groups, of course, used to have its own customs, traditions and laws.Apart from the administration’s indifferent attitude, the poor education status strengthens their beliefs in superstitions, which acts a barrier for the administration to convince them to take up health services or provide them health education. The poor nutritional status of Baiga children could be attributed broadly to poor socioeconomic status of the Baiga households–lack of employment opportunities, poor education status, strong cultural and religious beliefs, geographic and climatic conditions, which affect the quality, quantity as well as availability of food, and treatment seeking behavior impacting the child’s nutrition status.The administration should emphasize the detriments of open defecation and promote awareness regarding hygienic practices as well as how it can improve their conditions. Facilitation of aids for construction of personal or community toilets may encourage them to use it. Generating employment opportunities, which makes use of their traditional skills like collecting honey, herbs, etc. from forests, could prove helpful in addressing the problem of unemployment. As their poor economic condition is the root cause affecting the food availability, the Baiga women go to search for daily labour work even during pregnancy to earn some cash.Lack of even basic amenities adversely affects the children’s nutrition status directly or indirectly. There is a need to sensitize the public servants serving in these tribal areas so that they have a better understanding of the tribes. To improve the service uptake of public services, it is necessary to remove some bottlenecks such as illiteracy, geographical barriers and sensitivity towards the tribes. The onus lies on the state and its administration to facilitate services in a way that encourages the tribal people to access public institutions as well as to utilize them. Until, the basic services and needs of the tribes are satisfied, just providing supplementary nutrition is hardly going to bring any change in the children’s nutrition status and overall growth and development. The policies schemes designed for them must be framed by including their inputs instead of using the top-down approach. For instance, a toilet which was built adjacent to the primary school was utilized for storing grains and not for the original purpose. Including them and encouraging their participation will give them a sense of ownership and will help bridge the gap of trust between both parties. Thus, the consistently high prevalence of malnutrition among these children cannot be attributed to a single factor; actually it is a result of the cascading effect of a number of factors which are interlinked among themselves. For policymakers it is therefore important to frame policies which address the issue in a holistic way, because targeting a single factor will not be enough.']"

Contrary to the concerns that a switch from ice algae to phytoplankton diet would reduce the quality of food available to benthos, the high phytoplankton production in both polynyas has led to an increased macrofaunal utilisation of fresh, high quality food, compared to other Arctic regions where macroinfaunal diets mainly consist of refractory OM even at shallow depths. Differences in the total amount of food available was however reflected in the community trophic structure: the higher OM flux in NOW resulted in a shorter food web, with an even number of consumers placing on TL 1 and TL2. The different feeding guilds were also distinguishable by their δ15N signatures, showing that the abundant food allowed for selective feeding, maintaining trophic niche separation. In LS, the food web was longer, and the community had a larger proportion of higher consumers. Most fauna appeared to be facultative feeders, which resulted in lower trophic diversity compared to NOW. Based on the results here, the overall increase in phytoplankton primary production in the future could support highly abundant benthic macroinfaunal communities, and sites receiving less OM can establish thriving communities through facultative feeding and efficient recycling of OM within complex food webs. As the creation of such biological hotspots is facilitated by the elongated open water period, it is not beyond reason to suggest that Arctic benthic communities could benefit from the future changes in ice regime and the consequent shift from ice algae to phytoplankton system.']"

2013-08-02T00:00:00Z,Evaluation of Nutritional and Antioxidant Status of Lepidium latifolium Linn.: A Novel Phytofood from Ladakh,"['Our study showed that the ecotype of Lepidium latifolium present in Ladakh Himalayas does contain nutritionally significant levels of fatty acids and glucosinolates. The presence of high amount of sinigrin is of particular significance as its degradation product amounts to allyl isothiocyanates, which have known health alleviating properties. Leaves of this plant were found to contain among the highest amount of sinigrin among phytofoods. The plant was also reported to contain higher amount of linolenic acid and higher PUFA/SFA ratio, which is desirable for any food. The nutritive value of its leaves was found even higher than some of the widely used vegetable and fruits of family Brassicaceae. Apart from its nutritive properties, it was shown to contain substantial antioxidant activities. Although tender top leaves are mostly used in food preparations, our results showed that leaves at all the positions contain substantial nutritional and antioxidant properties (Table 5). Total amount of phenols and flavanoids were shown to be correlated with radical scavenging properties in this plant. It is therefore proposed that consumption of its leaves needs to be promoted as they can compensate to the dietary requirements of the local folk.

2016-03-30T00:00:00Z,Linking Measures of Colony and Individual Honey Bee Health to Survival among Apiaries Exposed to Varying Agricultural Land Use,"['Taken together, our results indicate that colonies positioned in apiaries surrounded by the most potential forage collect more pollen and nectar resources over the summer. Such colonies also generally contain more brood and lower Varroa mite infestation rates in the fall, and have a higher overwintering success rate. Individual honey bees within those colonies possess a quantifiably better nutritional status by the end of the foraging season (September). Likely as a result of this higher quality nutritional state, bees in those colonies displayed a less activated immune system, as evidenced by their decreased humoral immune response. Conversely, colonies positioned at sites with the least area in potential bee forage expressed some of the lowest nutritional stores (vitellogenin, insulin-like peptide1, lipids generally) and highest levels of humoral immunity. Importantly, our combined model was consistent with the two separate models of colony and individual bee measures (i.e. the best combined model contained pollen collection, brood, Varroa, and def1). The combined modeling indicated that colony measures were more strongly indicative of apiary survival that those taken from individual bees. Individual bee measures were taken from a fewer number of hives than colony measures, and none of the individual-bee sampled colonies actually died over the winter. These factors likely contributed to this result. We would expect a greater divergence of individual bee physiological indicators to emerge if taken from bees with a more varied colony health background, such as visually weak or diseased autumn colonies.Potential trade-offs between nutrition and immunity have been previously observed in honey bees in the lab, specifically between vitellogenin and defensin1, wherein immune stimulation resulted in increased AMP defense and a concurrent decrease in vitellogenin expression [68]. Further, stimulation of the Toll signaling pathway in Drosophila has been shown to lead to a decrease in nutrient stores [58]. In terms of our field study, the improved nutritional (higher) and immunological (quieter) states of bees in September at sites with higher survival were those surrounded by more forage throughout the summer and this may explain the differences observed in overwintering survival among the study sites.Future research on honey bee colonies positioned across a broader variety of landscapes and beekeeping practices is planned to test how robust the predictors of colony and apiary survival are. Efforts to identify absolute levels of particular genes and other physiological measures relating to health and survival may prove fruitful in providing beekeepers and researchers alike with a reliable tool or metric to accurately and objectively assess the status of their hives. If beekeepers were able to obtain measures of gene expression, it would enable them to assess and identify particular sites where colonies are at an increased risk of failure (due to relatively lower nutritional and/or higher immune measures) and thus may need to be closely monitored and possibly treated for parasites and diseases, or nutritionally supplemented. Beekeepers may even choose to withhold treatments and supplements from such colonies if they are likely to perish over the winter regardless of interventions. Such a “blood test” for bees would be a breakthrough in the ongoing struggle to maintain healthy, live colonies of honey bees to meet the current demands for pollination, support a robust beekeeping industry, and ensure a safe and reliable food system.This study uncovered measures of honey bee health and immunity relating to apiary-level phenomena, i.e. apiary survival, influenced by landscape suitability. While much interest exists regarding the effects of land use on honey bee (and other pollinator) health and survival, little data exist on which to build coherent real-world policies that will significantly improve the situation for honey bees and other pollinators. As such, this study is a novel first step toward identifying pertinent physiological responses that honey bees may have as a result of their positioning near varying landscape features in intensive agricultural environments.']"
2016-10-07T00:00:00Z,Evidence of In Vivo Absorption of Lactate and Modulation of Short Chain Fatty Acid Absorption from the Reticulorumen of Non-Lactating Cattle Fed High Concentrate Diets,"['It can be concluded that feeding of 60% concentrate in the diet DM promoted ruminal SCFAs absorption in cattle. However, the feeding pattern played a key role. Compared with forage-only baseline feeding, the continuous concentrate feeding pattern over 4 wk exerted a positive effect on SCFAs absorption across the rumen wall, while the interrupted condition with a 1 wk of concentrate break between two shorter challenge periods did not change ruminal absorption capability. The enhancement in SCFAs absorption could partly elucidate the lesser severity of SARA with the persistent condition reported earlier. In addition, the present study proclaims that adaptation of the reticulorumen epithelium, as a mechanism to increase the SCFAs absorption capability, needs more than 1–2 wk in response to feeding of highly fermentable diets in cattle and an interruption of the feeding pattern could stall the adaptation process of the rumen epithelium. Finally, the study provides evidence that lactate can be absorbed through the rumen which was induced by both 2 wk of the re-challenge (interrupted challenge) and 4 wk of the continuous challenge.']"
2015-11-23T00:00:00Z,The Zinc Concentration in the Diet and the Length of the Feeding Period Affect the Methylation Status of the ZIP4 Zinc Transporter Gene in Piglets,"['The data of this study provide evidence for DNA methylation as a mechanism for the regulation of the expression of the ZIP4 transcripts in the jejunal epithelium of growing weaned piglets. We could show that the zinc concentration in the feed and the length of the feeding period and/or the age had influence on the methylation pattern. The major changes in the methylation pattern between one and four weeks of feeding different diets containing normal, low, and very high zinc concentrations led us to the conclusion that massive methylation in putative regulatory regions of the ZIP4 gene might be a mechanism of gene regulation in the long term and probably does not play a role in acute short-term response to high dietary zinc concentrations. Since there was only one CpG across all diet groups that was influenced by the dietary zinc concentration and that had also an effect on the ZIP4 expression, we conclude that DNA methylation in response to the dietary zinc concentration may have only minor regulatory effects. DNA methylation of single CpGs could serve as a fine tuning mechanism for ZIP4 gene regulation.']"
2018-07-09T00:00:00Z,"Knowledge, attitude and practice on diet and physical activity among mothers with young children in the Jhaukhel-Duwakot Health Demographic Surveillance Site, Nepal","['Our community-based study demonstrated that mothers of young children in JD-HDSS poorly understand the concepts of healthy/unhealthy diet, and identified a gap between knowledge and practice of mothers regarding diet and physical activity. Our findings suggest that JD-HDSS could benefit from a health education intervention designed to address the dietary and physical activity aspects of mothers’ practice. Besides improving knowledge, such an intervention should address attitude and practical changes (e.g., improving mothers’ self-efficacy). Moreover, deeper understanding of mothers’ self-perceived barriers for healthy lifestyle could offer important insights to the contents of the intervention. The results presented here support a future health education intervention targeting mothers with young children because they are prominent role models in their children’s lives [45, 35, 46]. In the long term, future health education interventions could therefore favorably contribute to decrease morbidity and mortality from CVD in JD-HDSS by shaping healthy practice in early childhood.']"
2017-05-04T00:00:00Z,Isotope analyses to explore diet and mobility in a medieval Muslim population at Tauste (NE Spain),"['Isotope signatures in archaeological human remains have been used to investigate palaeomobility and the palaeodiet of the medieval Muslim population at Tauste, on the changing frontier between Muslim and Christian kingdoms in the 8th to 10th centuries.The combination of strontium and oxygen isotope analyses was able to discriminate non-local and local individuals. Although Tauste was located on the northern al-Andalus frontier most individuals were of local origin and only three females and two males were non-locals. Establishing the provenance of incoming individuals is difficult as strontium isotope ratios indicate a similar geological region. According to the oxygen isotope composition, two males would come from a warmer region while two females would come from a more mountainous geographical area. Also T-24 was of non-local origin since the different strontium values indicate a different geological provenance. Within the local population, the female T-32 stand out because she was born in Tauste, some years later she moved and lived in another geological region and then returned to Tauste a few years before she died.As regards the medieval Muslim diet, the δ13C and δ15N results illustrate not only differences in diet according to sex and age but also the environmental conditions. The extremely high δ15N values in Tauste population (δ15N = 15.0‰ on average) indicate an anomalously high δ15N baseline that can be explained by the concurrence of (1) geological and environmental conditions, (2) the manuring effect on vegetables, cereals and livestock and (3) the consumption of freshwater fish. The amount of fish in the diet varies from 50% to <20% as the manuring effect increases. Significant differences were observed in δ13C and δ15N by sex, indicating different diets that may be related to the sexual division of labor since Muslim female work was restricted to the household. The main dietary differences between males and females were amongst adult individuals, suggesting adult males were differentially valued in medieval Muslim society and consumed more animal protein than females and young males. The lower δ15N values of the elder females indicated lower protein consumption due to lesser dietary needs. In contrast, the significant higher δ15N values in the children younger than 4 years could be related to the “nursing effect”.']"
2013-12-03T00:00:00Z,Detecting Inter-Cusp and Inter-Tooth Wear Patterns in Rhinocerotids,"['Extending the mesowear categories of occlusal relief (OR) and cusp shape (CS), and using the single cusp scoring method, facilitated a more differentiated measure of wear detecting intra-cusp and intra-tooth wear pattern differences, and provided new insights into the diets, ingestion and mastication in rhinos. Differences between species corresponded to expectations, with the exception of R. unicornis, whose natural diet may contain fewer abrasives than assumed by the grass-dominated diet, which may be due to a lower intake of environmental abrasives in a riverine habitat. Using the method adjustments, differential wear was detected between cusps, particularly in Diceros bicornis where the anterior cusps exhibited consistently more abrasion-dominated wear patterns than the posterior cusps. By contrast, cusp differences were less evident in Rhinoceros unicornis and Ceratotherium simum, with more homogeneous wear between cusps. Wear differences in cusp position may relate to morphological adaptations to specific dietary regimes. A heterogeneous occlusal surface may facilitate the comminution of heterogeneous browse, whereas a uniform, broad grinding surface may enhance the comminution of physically more homogeneous grass. In D. bicornis, Rhinoceros unicornis and R. sondaicus, there was a negative wear gradient along the tooth row, with teeth becoming less abrasion-dominated from P2-M2. There are two potential explanations. Firstly, jaw biomechanics whereby the posterior teeth experience higher bite forces and smaller and more consistent transversal movements, and secondly ingesta-specific properties, with changes to the abrasive signal from grit and dust due to bolus mixing from P2-M2. The P2 may also have a role in food cropping in D. bicornis. However, no gradients were observed in grazing C. simum; therefore high or low ingesta abrasiveness provides the most parsimonious explanation of presence or absence of tooth wear gradients. A high consumption of abrasives by grazers will override other signals, leading to a uniform wear pattern and dental function along the tooth row, which could relate to the observed evolution towards homodonty. Due to the cusp and tooth position wear differences, the posterior M2 provided scores analogous with the positions used so far in the literature to infer diet. The results of this study raise questions about the influence of tooth morphology, jaw biomechanics and ingesta-specific properties on the development of tooth wear gradients in extant and extinct ungulates, and the evolution of homodonty as a possible response to abrasion.']"
2019-12-09T00:00:00Z,Mystery or method? Evaluating claims of increased energy expenditure during a ketogenic diet,"['Friedman and Appel’s secondary analysis failed to account for RQ differences between chamber and non-chamber days and therefore resulted in the erroneous conclusion that non-chamber energy expenditure was significantly increased during the KD period. Methods to appropriately adjust the RQ values used in DLW calculations were previously published [7] and implementing those adjustments resulted in no significant differences in non-chamber energy expenditure between the diet periods. After removing two clear DLW outliers whose data violated the physical law of energy conservation, the difference in non-chamber energy expenditure between the diet periods was quantitatively small (<60 kcal/d) and not statistically significant. Furthermore, the DLW energy expenditure values adjusted for non-chamber RQ were in agreement with measurements of body weight, composition, physical activity, and respiratory chamber expenditure.In contrast, Friedman and Appel’s DLW calculations that failed to appropriately account for non-chamber RQ resulted in apparent increases in non-chamber expenditure during the KD that were uncorroborated by other measurements. The mechanisms proposed by Friedman and Appel for such apparent non-chamber energy expenditure differences between diet periods are somewhat mysterious. For example, non-chamber muscular work efficiency was suggested to have decreased during the KD period thereby resulting in increased non-chamber physical activity expenditure, but this hypothesis is not supported by the similar efficiency of fixed-wattage cycling exercise between the diet periods [5] and actigraphy measurements indicated either a decrease or no significant differences in non-chamber physical activity between KD and BD periods [8]. Friedman and Appel also suggested that the energy-requiring process of gluconeogenesis may have been responsible for increased non-chamber expenditure during the KD. However, it is unclear why non-chamber days would require additional gluconeogenesis as compared to chamber days. Furthermore, any such increase in non-chamber gluconeogenesis could not possibly amount to the ~120–180 g/d calculated to be required to explain Friedman and Appel’s reported ~200–300 kcal/d differences [11] in non-chamber energy expenditure during the KD as compared to the BD periods.In conclusion, the mysterious apparent increase in non-chamber expenditure that Friedman and Appel claim supports the carbohydrate-insulin model is more likely explained by methodological flaws in their DLW calculations that resulted in overestimating the difference in non-chamber expenditure between KD and BD periods.']"
2015-04-29T00:00:00Z,Are Cranial Biomechanical Simulation Data Linked to Known Diets in Extant Taxa? A Method for Applying Diet-Biomechanics Linkage Models to Infer Feeding Capability of Extinct Species,"['Biomechanical and shape analyses were conducted on extant carnivoran species with different feeding preferences to test the ability of simulation-based biomechanical proxies to accurately reconstruct feeding niches, and how such diet-biomechanics linkage models can inform inference of potential feeding preference in extinct species. Masticatory simulations of the canine to molar dentitions in extant carnivoran skull models and two extinct species showed that estimated maximum muscle force and output bite force are positively allometric relative to skull work-efficiency, with increases in size, and that larger species tend to have more dorsoventrally oriented skulls that are stiffer relative to the bite force produced. The range of mechanical efficiency in the dentition is conserved across carnivoran models, and skull stiffness is generally higher in feliforms than in caniforms regardless of feeding niche. Both are interpreted as plesiomorphic or ancestral biomechanical features at their respective clade levels. After accounting for these size-related and phylogenetic effects of cranial mechanical properties, the skulls of hypercarnivores are characterized by differential optimization of skull stiffness to force output at the anterior dentition for ambush killing felids, and at the posterior dentition for canids utilizing crushing bites. Both omnivores and invertebrate/vertebrate feeders have skulls that exhibit gradual increases in work efficiency and force output from the anterior to the posterior dentition, indicating generalized skull biomechanics corresponding to generalized diets.The creodont outgroup species Thinocyon velox exhibits a bimodal ME-SE profile, indicating mechanical properties associated with both prey capture using anterior teeth and crushing using posterior teeth, and may represent a unique hypercarnivorous feeding style among the species examined. The stem carnivoramorphan Oodectes herpestoides has a biomechanical profile similar to extant generalists, but has an elevated ME-SE profile unlike any of the extant feeding categories analyzed, suggesting suitability for feeding on smaller prey relative to their body size compared to extant generalists. Because such biomechanically relevant proxies are directly linked to measures of performance for specific, ecologically important tasks, they have the potential to provide more tightly associated form-function linkages in extinct taxa than traditional linear multivariate morphological proxies of diet, for which functional significance is only broadly defined. The complex interactions of phylogenetic, body size, and ecological factors observed to be associated with specific sets of cranial mechanical properties suggest that the use of diet-biomechanics linkage models to assign taxa to pre-defined feeding categories, and to study the paleobiology of extinct species relative to extant forms, both require careful isolation of factors that might influence our ability to reliably identify the ecological signals relative to ancestry or size influences. Our findings also clearly demonstrate that cranial mechanical properties in extant species can reflect a combination of both ancestral (phylogenetic retentions) and ecological (adaptive) traits. Thus interpretations of diet and feeding preference in fossils need to first account for potentially confounding factors of morphological evolution (relative to hypotheses of adaptation), such as size scaling issues and ancestral retentions or constraints, even though these nevertheless may represent existing exaptations [55] for the form-function relationship being studied.']"

This study has implications for the conservation of viable habitat for endangered frugivores like orangutans. Peat-swamp forests hold the largest remaining relatively undisturbed populations of Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) and are considered excellent habitats for orangutans [56,58,60]. As more orangutans are relocated due to agricultural pressures, specifically the growing pressures of oil palm expansion in peatland habitats [107,108], finding suitable habitats that provide sufficient energy for orangutans has become an increasing challenge [109]. Here, we have shown that what appears to be similar habitat does not necessarily translate into similar nutrient intake of its inhabitants. Our results indicate that reductions in habitat quality that would be expected following human disturbance, and consequently the availability of higher-quality fruits, are likely to lead to negative impacts on orangutan nutrition, with potential long-term impacts on population density. This suggests that it is important to incorporate careful habitat quality assessment and maintenance into future conservation action plans for this endangered species.']"

This substitution did exert a significant effect on Cu urine excretion and Cu retention in the body. The addition of Cu to the diet of rats, irrespective of the form and dose, contributed to greater excretion of this element in the faeces and urine and to lower digestibility than in the rats whose diet was not supplemented with Cu. Copper in the form of CuNP was better absorbed in the digestive tract than CuS, as indicated by its lower excretion in the urine and faeces and its greater accumulation in the brain. It should be stressed that the higher dosage of CuNP resulted in the occurrence of high-grade hydropic degeneration and necrotic lesions in the livers of the rats. The application of CuNP significantly stifled bacterial enzymatic activity of caecal gut microbiota and resulted in lower SCFA production. But the observed diminishing effect of CuNP on microbiota metabolic activity was accompanied by a relative increase in the secretion of glycoside hydrolases by bacterial cells in the caecum of rats.

Because we did not find any hints for substantial diagenetic alterations, we believe that the significant differences in Sr-concentrations have predominantly physiological reasons. If we accept real physiological differences, arising from different diet habits, then the high Sr/Ca-ratio for gladiators seems to be associated to a specific alimentation during their years spent at the fighter's school.""]"

First, our results demonstrate that diet-induced obesity promotes the initial phases of AD neuropathology but has no effect on the progression of established pathology. Second, we provide the first definitive evidence in an AD model that directly supports the critical window hypothesis, which posits that HT significantly delays the onset and/or reduces the risk of AD only when initiated near the onset of menopause when the brain retains high estrogen responsiveness. Third, we observe important interactions between obesity and HT. Although HT attenuates some effects of diet-induced obesity even in aged mice, we found that obesity significantly diminished the neuroprotective effects of HT in middle-aged mice. Finally, our data are consistent with a role of microglia as a significant mediator of the observed effects, with morphological and molecular evidences of microglial activation predicting the deleterious effects of obesity and the protective effects of HT on AD-related pathology. Collectively, these findings suggest that the perimenopause is an important transition that affects the independent and interactive effects of obesity and HT on development of AD in women.']"
2017-07-28T00:00:00Z,Effects of dietary lipids on the hepatopancreas transcriptome of Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis),"['The effects of dietary lipid resources on the Chinese mitten crab were analyzed with transcriptome analysis, which showed that dietary lipids had obvious effects on the lipid metabolism in the hepatopancreas of the crabs. Replacing FO with vegetable oils significantly altered fat digestion and absorption, fatty acid metabolism, fatty acid degradation, fatty acid biosynthesis, unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, and many other lipid metabolism pathways. Compared with FO, the increasing addition of SO and LO in the diets of the crabs might decrease the digestion and absorption of dietary lipids, fatty acids biosynthesis, and virus immunologic defense, and increase β-oxidation by altering the expression of the genes for PL, ACSLs, CPTI, ACC, FAS, fatty acyl Δ9-desaturase, TLRs, STAT, and other relevant genes. However, the details of the effects of dietary lipids on Chinese mitten crab are still unclear; future studies should use the E. sinensis genomic sequence to improve the transcriptome. Moreover, the present study was conducted at transcriptional level; protein expression should also be analyzed to further understand the lipid metabolism of Chinese mitten crabs fed different lipid diets.']"
2014-11-03T00:00:00Z,"Coexistence of Fish Species in a Large Lowland River: Food Niche Partitioning between Small-Sized Percids, Cyprinids and Sticklebacks in Submersed Macrophytes","['In the SAM habitat the diet overlap was highest when the SAM patches, and the food resources associated with them, were most developed (twice during the investigated period). For the first time at the beginning of SAM development, when large-sized Hydropsyche were the main food category for ruffe, perch and dace, and for the second time throughout June and the first half of July, when benthic and/or epiphytic Chironomidae were the basic food items for these species. This finding is congruent with the niche overlap hypothesis saying that maximal tolerable niche overlap can be higher in less intensely competitive situations, i.e. in environments with lower demand/supply ratios [77].One of the most important attributes of organisms to avoid direct overlap in the use of resources is diversification of body size of individuals of given species [60]. We put focus on three (time, space and resource) of the four niche axes of each of the five fish species living among the submersed macrophytes and we concluded that their diets only partly overlap, which allows them to coexist in this temporary, very rich habitat.']"
2015-07-21T00:00:00Z,"Meat Feeding Restricts Rapid Cold Hardening Response and Increases Thermal Activity Thresholds of Adult Blow Flies, Calliphora vicina (Diptera: Calliphoridae)","['Newly emerged adult C. vicina feeding on a carbohydrate-based diet possess a level of cold tolerance, and the ability to rapidly cold harden, which may allow them to survive the lowest temperatures currently experienced in the UK. These adults cannot persist throughout the many months of winter, however, and so must feed on meat to allow egg development. This study has identified, for the first time, that meat feeding significantly impairs the RCH response in insects, as well as increasing low temperature activity thresholds. Thus, even brief access to protein can shift resource allocation away from stress responses, influencing the frequency and duration of chilling injury. There is increasing interest in patterns of energy trade-offs between stress tolerance and other fitness traits as a result of diet [63,71], but studies in insects to date have mainly focussed on Drosophila, which for many reasons is not always the best model to investigate insect stress adaptation [23]. The next step is to characterise the physiological and molecular processes underpinning this change, and ideally in a wider range of species.']"

Meanwhile, the sex-related differences in T3 levels reflect distinct metabolic physiology between female and male FMD. The negative relationship between parasite egg shedding and age suggests an immune adaption with the aging of hosts. The results have great potential in future management of FMD and relative ruminants at several aspects: 1) the baseline information on fecal thyroid hormones with bovine T3 antibody has been established, which can be used to unveil physiological status and metabolic characteristics of FMD; 2) when breeders feed FMD, they should take consideration of factors of sex, age and even breeding center to guide the diet allocation, for example, the younger FMD should be given the diet containing more concentrate food to meet the higher energy demand; 3) the results have revealed a relationship between thyroid hormones and GI parasite infection, which may be a general pattern in ruminants, in turn may potentially improve techniques in disease diagnosis.']"
2017-02-16T00:00:00Z,"Impact of levels of total digestible nutrients on microbiome, enzyme profile and degradation of feeds in buffalo rumen","['The study was aimed to understand shift in rumen microbiome of buffalo fed various levels of TDN and to correlate it with in vivo fermetation and in vitro feed digestibility so as to achieve a complete knowledge about buffalo rumen microbiome fed feeds differing in TDN content. A higher F/B ratio (estimated by metagenomics) in high fiber groups was positively correlated with higher Ruminococcus population (by real time PCR) in these groups indicates that these microbes are essentially required for fiber degradation. Only a very few parameters differed among the treatments, which might not be sufficient to clearly define the fibre degrading ability of rumen microbiome. When the rumen liquor from differently fed buffaloes, as described above, was used as inoculum in in vitro gas production test, a difference was observed in methane production when different hays were used as substrate, but there was no effect on feed digestibility and volatile fatty acids production. These results reveal a complex microbial diversity in the rumen of buffaloes with no effect of diet on profile of microorganisms involved in degradation of polysaccharides and gene pool of carbohydrate active enzymes. The variations in concentrate mixture (19–49% of the ration) or maize grain content (8–21% in the concentrate mixture) in the diets were not sufficiently enough to express change of appreciable magnitude in the microbial diversity or enzyme profile of rumen. Therefore, it appears that wider feed variations, especially in grain content are required to bring out significant shifts in metatranscriptomic libraries so that contributions of genes of interest derived from specific microbes for cellulose degradation could be identified which might be further targeted for rumen manipulation to maximize extraction of nutrients from poor quality lignocellulosic feed. One more thing observed was that even after feeding of similar diet, individual variation of animal plays important role in deciding rumen microbiome of ruminant.']"
2019-01-10T00:00:00Z,Dietary calcium affects body composition and lipid metabolism in rats,"['Ca intakes for a large segment of the North American population fall short of dietary recommendations [70, 71], while upper percentiles of intakes for some subpopulations (e.g., older women) exceed the upper limit from use of high-dose Ca supplements [72]. Thus, it is important to understand the effects of Ca intakes on CVD risk. This study has shown that differences in dietary Ca alone (i.e., without changes in other components in dairy foods) has little effect on body weight or fat mass in rats unless Ca intakes are very low. Diets containing above normal amounts of Ca induced changes in blood lipids predictive of a lower risk for CVD. More than one mechanism may account for the changes in blood lipids. At high Ca doses (20Ca diet containing ~400% of normal Ca), decreased absorption of neutral sterols and increased excretion of bile acids as well as decreased digestibility of TFA and SFA may have contributed to the lower serum TC and LDL-C. At a lower Ca dose above normal (10Ca diet containing ~200% of normal Ca), decreased digestibility of TFA and SFA may have played a larger role given the absence of a significant effect on cholesterol balance. Ca intakes of 200% normal requirements (i.e., ~2-fold the recommended dietary allowance) occur in the general population. Consumption of 400% normal Ca requirements is rare, but high concentrations of Ca in the GI tract can occur with consumption of high-dose Ca supplements at one time. A major finding reported in this paper is the large decrease in digestibility of TFA with higher dietary Ca. Further research is needed to determine whether the Ca in dairy products attenuates the adverse effects of TFA in these products. This is important since natural TFA may have the same adverse effects on blood lipids as industrial TFA, but are more difficult to remove from the food supply.']"
2019-01-02T00:00:00Z,Complementary methods assessing short and long-term prey of a marine top predator ‒ Application to the grey seal-fishery conflict in the Baltic Sea,"['Analysis of gut contents was required to identify prey species, and both morphological analysis of prey hard parts and DNA metabarcoding showed clear dietary differences between age groups and areas. Concerning the foraging ecology of the seals, these proxies of the very recent diet cannot reveal potential specialization of individuals for certain feeding area or prey type. For this purpose the mid- and long-term markers can be used. The bycaught adult males formed distinctive groups having similar FA and SI markers, which resembled the marker patterns of the fish caught in the area by the gear type in which the seals were found (Fig 4, S2 Fig). A probable interpretation was that these adult males had been using the same foraging areas for long, and perhaps raiding the gears there repeatedly. Since these groupings by the mid- and long-term dietary markers were the most obvious in the adult males, this is likely a consequence of specialized foraging or male territorial behaviour. Selective removal of problem seals has been suggested to mitigate the conflicts between seals and coastal fisheries. In the light of the current study, if implemented, such selective culling should be directed towards the adult males that were found to be the most specialized in their foraging tactics, and may locally cause significant economic losses for fisheries in the form of gear damage and loss of catch. Differences in mid-term diet, reflecting foraging areas, were also seen in the liver SIs, which also may have distinguished a few migrated seals.This study suggests a combination of multiple diet estimation methods as the optimal protocol to assess as detailed information as possible about feeding habits of aquatic top predators. Efficient use of the dietary methods, however, sets high requirements for recording detailed background information on the studied individuals, which is a prerequisite for discovering dietary subgroups in large diverse data sets.']"
2013-10-24T00:00:00Z,Maternal Malnutrition and Offspring Sex Determine Juvenile Obesity and Metabolic Disorders in a Swine Model of Leptin Resistance,"['The results obtained in the present study indicate that exposure of Iberian pigs to maternal under- or overnutrition during pregnancy makes the offspring more prone to higher postnatal corpulence and adiposity. Such findings are supporting previous evidences found in the study of the DOHaD phenomena.However, the first main finding in the current study is that a postnatal exposure to food abundance was not necessary for triggering effects on growth patterns and fatness. Changes in body development and adiposity were observed even in case of controlled intake during the first months after birth and even at early postnatal stages, during lactation. Afterwards, the exposure of these individuals to obesogenic diets increases significantly fat accumulation when compared to offspring from pregnancies with balanced diets. The second main finding of the current study is the fact that these effects can be amplified in the female sex. The effects of sex are even more remarkable in offspring exposed to maternal undernutrition during the last two thirds of pregnancy. In this case, patterns of body growth and corpulence are similar to control piglets but females have a strong predisposition to obesity, and even stronger after exposition to obesogenic diets. Finally, such alterations in patterns of growth and fattening could be related to the development of metabolic syndrome (central obesity, impaired glucose regulation, insulin resistance and, dyslipidemia) and prodrome of type-2 diabetes at very early life stages.These findings provide a basis for clarifying the interaction between genetic and environmental factors in the determination of adult phenotype. The distinctive hallmark of our study is the use of the Iberian pig as a large animal model genetically adapted, for generations, to harsh environments and food scarcity. Hence, the data obtained are unique in translational studies of obesity and associated disorders in developing countries like China, India and Middle East countries, in which populations adapted for surviving in harsh environments are currently exposed to nutrient excess.

2016-06-03T00:00:00Z,Towards Sustainable Aquafeeds: Complete Substitution of Fish Oil with Marine Microalga Schizochytrium sp. Improves Growth and Fatty Acid Deposition in Juvenile Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus),"['This is the first study to use Sc as a complete fish oil replacement for Nile tilapia. Total replacement of the fish oil used in commercial diets with dried whole-cell Sc resulted in significantly higher weight gain (g) and protein efficiency ratio (PER), and lower (improved) feed conversion ratio (FCR) and feed intake when compared to the control feed containing fish oil (Sc0); and no significant change in specific growth rate and survival rate among all diets. Our results are interesting for tilapia farming by showing how microalgae inclusion can help optimize the composition of tilapia starter and juvenile feed. Diet formulation with dried whole-cell Sc is also an innovative strategy to raise the n3 LC PUFAs level and thus rebalance the n3:n6 and DHA:EPA ratios in farmed tilapia, which will benefit the health of human consumers. In our study, complete substitution of fish oil with Sc led to n3:n6 and DHA:EPA ratios of 1.4:1 and 34.2:1, respectively in tilapia fillets, suggesting the relative ease by which inclusion of whole cell Sc in tilapia diets can manipulate and tailor the n3 LC PUFA composition of tilapia fillets. However, in this study we used juvenile fish over a narrow growth range. Feed manufacturers can explore this approach to develop aquafeeds for aquaculturists aiming to cater to the consumer willing to pay a premium for health enhanced foods. Niche markets may therefore be developed for these nutritionally enhanced tilapia fillets.In order for such nutritionally enhanced tilapia to succeed in the market, researchers have to find the ways to cut the high production cost of microalgae [39,40]. Towards this end, we are now focusing our research on reducing production costs by using organic waste streams, such as on-site fish culture effluent, as a partial replacement for expensive, external inputs of inorganic compounds normally used to grow microalgae. Furthermore, ongoing research to lower costs of producing and processing microalgae for biofuel and human nutraceuticals may lead to higher market availability and lower price of this microalga in the near future [41,42,43]. Our findings also open up a pathway to reduce or eliminate ingredients extracted from marine forage fish and from industrially farmed crops in aquafeeds. Our lab is now investigating combinations of different marine microalgae to reduce or eliminate fish oil, as well as fishmeal, in aquafeeds, towards the goal of improving life-cycle ecological and social sustainability of aquafeeds.']"
2018-09-14T00:00:00Z,‘Yellow is good for you’: Consumer perception and acceptability of fortified and biofortified cassava products,"['Our study shows that novel biofortified cassava products, namely eba and fufu, were well accepted by local consumers and that yellow colour did not make a difference to acceptability. An interesting observation was that the traditional yellow-coloured RPO-fortified eba product was not as acceptable as the biofortified product of the same colour and this was because the fortified product had less desirable sensory characteristics (possibly due to the addition of palm oil). Good acceptance of biofortified cassava products shows that the barrier to acceptance of novel nutritious food is lower than expected in rural areas of Africa, providing that these products have acceptable sensory characteristics. According to the results of this study, it is anticipated that eba and fufu made from yellow biofortified cassava are likely to be well accepted by local Nigerian populations.We used a range of methods to describe the sensory and nutritional perception of the products: a classic sensory analysis with a semi-trained panel and two more recent sensory methods with consumers (CATA and JAR). The methods gave consistent results in terms of sensory description of the products. Moreover, the CATA method added another dimension (nutritional perception) to describe products. To our knowledge, it was the first time that the CATA and JAR methods have been used on biofortified crops in a low-and-middle-income- country setting and this shows that there is potential to develop quality nutritional and sensory profiling using consumers with a limited level of formal education.There was not a clear perception of the link between health benefits (‘good for eye sight’ and ‘good for children’s health’) and the yellow colour of the products. Consumers mistakenly considered that the yellow fortified product was equivalent to white cassava products in terms of health benefits. Hence consumers were not aware of the correlation between yellow colour (in RPO-fortified or biofortified cassava products) and provitamin A. These findings highlight a gap in knowledge in local populations who are beneficiaries of biofortification programs and we advocate for dietary diversification and training programmes that will equally promote biofortified foods and vitamin A-rich- local foods.']"

This positive effect may lead to a greater protection against the bone loss that occurs later in life, when bones become thinner, resulting in a loss of strength to cracks and/or collapses. Furthermore, maternal prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin supplementation and Ca fortification produce a better structural base not only at spongiosa but also at the cortical vertebra of offspring bones, producing an increase in the offspring peak bone mass and, therefore, could help delaying the bone loss produced in adulthood and the risk of developing osteoporosis. Thus, based on our study results, prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin supplementation in non-deficient nutritional conditions may be considered as a plausible nutritional option for pregnant and lactating women rather than Ca supplementation, for maximizing the peak of bone mass in the offspring from the growing period till adolescence, and for protection of the maternal bone mass during gestation and lactation as a strategy to increase bone strength and to prevent bone fragility after menopause.']"

The nutrient element levels suggested that Cenococcum geophilum plays a stronger role in plant S nutrition, Lactarius subdulcis in plant P nutrition, and Clavulina cristata in belowground Ca retention than the other analyzed fungi. Root cells of ash colonized by Glomus sp. contained outstanding K concentrations, but in contrast to our expectation not the highest P concentrations.Ash trees are known to influence their soil environment by affecting the cation balance. Our results imply a major role of AM in this important ecosystem function. Currently, we cannot distinguish whether AM are responsible for high K acquisition from soil minerals or whether they have high capacities for K retention and efficiently recapture cations released from degrading leaf litter. This should be clarified in future studies. It should be emphasized that our results, obtained at a subcellular level, open new views on ecosystem functions and services at higher scales. Ash is a tree species with a wide ecological amplitude that gains importance as a component in mixed forests that are more suitable to withstand global climate change [59]. When forest tree composition is changed to cope with the challenges of global change, it is important to consider the consequences for symbiotic interactions and the edaphic environment.']"

In terms of WPIs, we postulate this observed effect to be attributed, at least in part, to the observed increase in β-HAD enzyme activity in the soleus muscle of the rats which may have improved endurance by increasing fat utilisation and sparing muscle glycogen. The mechanisms pertaining to the effect of TCTs on exercise endurance in this study are unclear but may relate to increased mitochondrial membrane potential [54]. This study provides rationale for future investigative studies to explore the mechanistic pathways involved in the endurance exercise-enhancing effects mediated by WPIs and TCTs in diet-induced obese rats. Future investigations into the oxygen consumption, via indirect calorimetry, and use of tracer technology to determine glucose utilisation and fatty acid oxidation in models of diet-induced obesity are also warranted. Furthermore, it will be essential to follow up using a female cohort to show that the benefits of the supplementations are generalizable.

In fact, LTI quail seemed to search for a comfort food as they showed a higher preference for the hypercaloric diet and a lower motivation for the hypocaloric diet compared to STI quail.Coming back to the main objective of this study, unpredictable and repeated negative stimuli increased the emotional reactivity of quail and induced large changes in quail’s feeding behaviour although these changes differed between lines. LTI disturbed quail seemed to express a short-term compensatory behaviour because of their high motivation to eat, whereas STI disturbed quail seemed to be in a devaluation process as shown by their anhedonia and their decrease of daily intakes. Thus, URNS induced a chronic stress state in quail, but they exhibited various ways to cope with these negative events depending on their genetic background.Chronic stress altered animal welfare but also decreased the profitability of the poultry breeding system as it decreased animal’s body weight and delay the onset of laying. The identification of chronic stressors in poultry breeding systems is thus of importance.']"
2019-08-16T00:00:00Z,Identification of dietary patterns associated with elevated blood pressure among Lebanese men: A comparison of principal component analysis with reduced rank regression and partial least square methods,"['The findings of this study showed that the three dietary patterns identified using PCA among Lebanese males were: Western, Traditional Lebanese and Fish and Alcohol patterns. Both the Western and the Traditional Lebanese patterns were associated with higher odds of elevated BP in the study population. These findings are important in light of the escalating burden of hypertension and its associated cardiovascular diseases among males in the country. Regarding the comparison of methods to derive dietary patterns, RRR and PLS derived patterns explained greater variance in the outcome and were significantly associated with elevated BP while the PCA dietary patterns were descriptive of the study population’s real dietary habits. It remains important to note that the hypotheses and objectives of a particular study must direct the selection of the statistical technique that will be used to identify dietary patterns. More specifically, should the aim of a study be exploratory of diet-disease association then PCA could be the appropriate choice for deriving the patterns. On the other hand, if a specific biological/physiological pathway between diet and diseases was to be examined then RRR and PLS would be recommended. This needs to be further investigated in future studies in different population groups, response variables and disease outcomes.']"

Thus, the current study provides evidence that enalapril protects the pancreatic islets against adverse remodeling in diet-induced obese mice with insulin resistance. The main findings include the following: (i) a reduction in food and energy intake that results in a small BM gain; (ii) an increase of adiponectin levels; (iii) an increase in the activity of the counter-regulatory ACE2/Ang (1-7) /Mas axis. In addition, losartan does not improve neither beta cell function nor insulin responsiveness in the HF mice, but increases the AT2R expression in islets. This indicates a role for AT2R in obesity-related disorders, principally regarding energy metabolism and insulin resistance. Further experimental and clinical studies are needed to clarify the precise mechanisms of RAS blockers, whether alone or in combination with other drugs, in cases of hypertension associated with T2DM. ACE inhibitors may be a promising therapeutic agent for obesity and its complications.']"

We designed our study to elucidate which category of prey species cheetahs are hunting and whether they are specialists on certain isotopic prey categories. Also, we were interested whether cheetahs hunt largely on livestock and/or on valuable trophy species. The latter question is most relevant for formulating management guidelines to conserve populations of Namibian cheetahs. Although our findings revealed a low percentage of cattle and valuable trophy species in the diet of the cheetahs, the monetary losses for farmer still might be substantial. The loss of a single cattle calves may convert to approximately 550 US$ for a Namibian farmer and the loss of a calf that might have grown to an adult trophy animal might convert to approximately 1,900 US$, 1,400 US$ and 650 US$ for eland, kudu and gemsbok respectively. A conversion of our findings into actual numbers of individual losses per species might be useful in further studies, yet this would require an estimation of total number of consumed prey individuals per cheetah, which was not part of our study.']"
2018-12-19T00:00:00Z,Understanding Final Neolithic communities in south-eastern Poland: New insights on diet and mobility from isotopic data,"['The study provided the first insights into the dietary preferences in the CWC communities of south-eastern Poland. Our results suggest that individuals in the Małopolska Upland and in the Subcarpathian region subsisted on a similar omnivorous diet composed of C3-based terrestrial plant and animal foods, in which plant food dominated. In both regions, there were no significant gender differences in dietary intake. However, there was a local variation in diet composition between the sites. In the Małopolska Upland, the mix of plant and animal foods contained a higher proportion of the latter. Higher δ15Ncoll values of younger infants are interpreted as representing the effects of weaning.Sr isotope data indicate that the CWC community in the Małopolska Upland consisted exclusively of the local population. In contrast, in the Subcarpathian region, four individuals (28% of the investigated group) were identified as people who died at a location other than place of their childhood. The Sr signatures of non-local individuals correspond well with associated allochthonous grave inventories of eastern or western provenience.We conclude also that a detailed Sr isotopic survey of the geological background and its hydrologic elements, rather than that of the fauna, seems to provide conclusive constraints for identification of local and non-local individuals in prehistoric communities.']"

2016-08-15T00:00:00Z,Terrestrial and Marine Foraging Strategies of an Opportunistic Seabird Species Breeding in the Wadden Sea,"[""Lesser black-backed gulls from Spiekeroog employed a dual foraging strategy using both marine and terrestrial habitats, similar to the situation described for black-headed gulls [6]. These data demonstrate that lesser black-backed gulls are not an exclusively or even predominantly marine species during the incubation period, in contrast to the conclusions of previous reports [7, 8]. Possible changes in diet and flight patterns over recent years cannot easily be investigated and are outwith the scope of this paper.Both marine and terrestrial targets appear to be attractive to lesser black-backed gulls. It is difficult to determine which targets are most beneficial, given that food availability cannot be quantified over such different habitats and large areas. However, both marine and terrestrial prey items are diverse and include components with high energy densities. Tracking of individuals during the incubation period suggested that a combination of both sea and inland trips was a useful strategy.Although the patterns revealed in this study were remarkably similar among individuals and may thus reflect the behaviour of the colony as a whole, differences between colonies are to be expected. For example, foraging patterns would be expected to differ at Amrum Island in the northeastern Wadden Sea as indicated by [13], where swimming crabs constitute roughly 50% of the diet of lesser black-backed gulls [3] and where both natural and discarded fish are relatively scarce in the diet [8, 9]. The current study may serve as a baseline for investigating the effects of future scenarios with reduced availability of discards associated with changes in EU fisheries policy, possibly leading to shifts in food choice towards pelagic fish and/or swimming crabs at sea, or towards terrestrial food. However, further changes in agricultural practice will lead to increased planting of corn for biogas production and a reduction in intensively-used grassland. It will be interesting to see how lesser black-backed gulls adapt to future man-made changes in both 'natural' and 'artificial' landscapes.""]"
2016-09-07T00:00:00Z,"Structural, Culinary, Nutritional and Anti-Nutritional Properties of High Protein, Gluten Free, 100% Legume Pasta","['In this study, the structure and properties of gluten-free pasta made using 100% faba, lentil and black-gram flours were investigated. Whatever the legume used, the cooking and rheological properties of pasta, its microscopic structure and the strength of its protein network clearly differed from those of gluten-free cereal pasta. Legume pasta is up to 2 to 6 times richer in fiber and produced a weaker protein network, which was mainly formed during the cooking step in comparison to the cereal gluten-free pasta in which drying is the step that leads to the creation of the protein network. The texture of the legume pasta was therefore weaker with notably low springiness scores. Interestingly, all legume pasta, which is three times richer in protein than gluten-free cereal pasta, lost less material during cooking. If most legume pasta structure and properties were similar, some differences were noticeable depending on the legume used for pasta production. Black-gram pasta had better rheological and cooking properties related to its particular richness in arabinogalactan fibers.From a nutritional point of view, in addition to their high protein content, the legume pasta also contained higher resistant starch than gluten-free cereal pasta. Furthermore, the remaining available starch in faba and lentil pasta was more slowly digested than the starch of gluten-free cereal pasta. This interesting in-vitro starch digestion profile could predict a lower glycemic index. However, even if legumes appear to be promising for the production of gluten-free pasta, their anti-nutritional factors need to be known. Trypsin inhibitory activity and the α-galactoside content can be drastically reduced during legume processing into pasta that includes a cooking step. Phytic acid was less affected by pasta processing, making germination, fermentation of legume grains or flours prior to pasta processing a promising option [22, 61].In conclusion, the promising nutritional quality of legume pasta, notably their richness in protein and fibers and their potential low glycemic index could be of interest to expand the range of gluten-free cereal pasta available on the market today.']"

No obvious ‘nutritional tipping point” to identify anabolism or recovery could be identified in our cohort.

2018-12-17T00:00:00Z,Characterization of canola oil extracted by different methods using fluorescence spectroscopy,"['Fluorescence spectroscopy along with chemometric analysis have been employed to study the effect of extraction methods on the nutritional values of canola oil. It has been found that canola oil extracted by cold press method is rich with fat soluble vitamins, vitamin E, beta carotene and chlorophylls. Similarly, chemically extracted oil possesses almost same molecular composition as that of cold press but the refining processes destroy its nutritional values. Therefore, if chemically extracted oil is not refined through the processes described in the text then the end users can enjoy its natural ingredients. In addition, it seems difficult to find the origin of commercial brands named as canola oil, as their spectra reflect only oxidized products. Furthermore, it has been investigated that the heating of cold pressed canola oil up to 180°C, does not lose most of its valuable ingredients. Therefore, it can be used safely for cooking of foods where usually temperature remains between 100–115 oC. In addition, present studies suggested that cold pressed canola oil can be used safely without destroying much of its valuable ingredients for frying of egg which needs temperature range 140–160°C and deep frying of meat and fish that needs temperature of oil around 180°C.']"

However, energy consumption from processed and ultra-processed foods was associated with a lower probability of inadequate vitamin B1 intake. In addition, a lower probability of inadequate zinc intake was observed only for energy consumption from ultra-processed foods, possibly attributed to food fortification. Considering the risk of micronutrient intake exceeding the UL, and the fact that ultra-processed foods are energy-dense, with high levels of fat, sugar, and/or sodium, we believe that it is crucial to stress the importance of limiting personal consumption of processed and ultra-processed foods, especially among the pediatric population. The position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics highlights that early care and education programs should recommended, from an early age, a high standard of nutritional quality for foods and beverages served. Efforts to promote healthy eating should be a national priority and include state and local policy changes [65]. Accordingly, the results of this study can help provide evidence for formulating global public policies that improve health in adolescence and prevent complications in adulthood.']"

Although it is unlikely that the ascidian benefits from this association, it is still unclear as to whether the shrimps harm their host or constitute commensal symbionts, as they may cause some reduction in the hosts’ growth or in their reproductive ability [6]. Future examination of the shrimp’s digestive system content could provide us with additional information regarding its diet. Inside their hosts, the shrimp can enjoy a safer environment from predators and the ovigerous-females can remain much more protected. The dense aggregations of H. momus assist O. sibogae males to fertilize a larger number of females and thus increase their reproductive success.The current study has provided an in-depth investigation of an overlooked, yet relatively common, symbiotic association. The evolutionary adaptation for this association demonstrated through the shrimp’s specific morphology and body color adaptation, combined with its selective behavior, serves as a basis for future research into such aspects as diet preferences or reproductive behavior, and for investigating the ability of the associated shrimp to expand its geographic distribution as a ""hitch-hiker"" within its host.']"

The question remains, however, what it is in the hosts’ background that caused this strong effect. Part of the variation among lines could be caused by genetic variation (e.g. in immunity and/or gut physiology), and/or part of it may reflect the composition of the microbiome that the founders of these lines acquired in their native environments. Irrespective of which factors caused the microbiome differences in our study, an important implication from our research is that studies that are performed on multiple strains or lines may not only reflect their differences in genotype, but also in the composition of their microbiome, even when these lines were reared in the same laboratory under standardized conditions for many years. Moreover, our data highlights the importance of the Drosophila microbiome in shaping host resistance to parasitism, pointing out that Wolbachia is not the only determinant of this host phenotype.']"

Moreover, the inclusion of 5% canola oil in pellets increased CG gain. Lamb breed significantly affected CG gain and wool quality. First-cross WxC lambs had the greatest CG gain while purebred Merinos had the best wool quality. Ewes had significantly greater FD than wethers, although gender did not influence other characteristics. Moderate to very strong correlations detected between wool quality traits were significant. In conclusion, canola and flaxseed oils can be effectively used in dual-purpose sheep systems during the 10-week feedlot period. The observed interaction effects of breed with oil supplementation permit flexibility in operational options of optimising profitability from meat in dual-purpose lamb production. It is proposed that supplementing 5% canola oil in CxM lamb diets or 5% flaxseed oil in WxC lamb diets could considerably improve their growth performance without detrimental impacts on wool quality, a win-win case of nutrient partitioning into the synthesis of muscle and wool without compromising either trait.']"

In this study we analysed bacterial and fungal communities in a cohort of 186 healthy individuals. Consistent with previous studies [8,9,62], we also report a low per sample fungal diversity, accompanied by a high interindividual variability, which is most likely a consequence of foodborne transient fungi. Out of 13 questionnaire-based host and environmental factors we report 3 significant host covariates. These are age- and gender-associated differences in bacterial communities and the rate of physical activity associated differences in fungal community. Fungal community is known to be largely affected by short-term diet, therefore we assume that the observed patterns highly depend on different diets individuals reported according to the time they dedicated to recreational activities and sport. We identified seven bacterial core genera, out of which three (Faecalibacterium, Bacteroides and Roseburia) commonly appear as core candidates in related studies originating from different geographic regions, including European, American and Mongolian cohorts. The consensus on these core genera, especially in such a variety of studied populations, suggests their pivotal role in the gut, that up to date remains undisclosed.']"

Remarkably, these attenuating effects co-occurred with generalized downregulation of CD4+ T cell-associated genes in the kidney and, to a lesser extent, in spleen that are associated with antigen presentation, T cell activation, leukocyte recruitment, B cell activation/differentiation and inflammatory responses. Many of these genes are under consideration as potential targets for development of expensive biological therapeutics for human SLE including monoclonal antibodies and receptor antagonists. Supplementation with n-3 PUFAs might be a lower cost alternative that could impact many of these therapeutic targets simultaneously. A major concern with this strategy would be whether doses needed to suppress autoimmunity and inflammation will adversely impact health by interfering with innate and adaptive immune responses to pathogens or neoplastic events [114]. Accordingly, further clarification is needed on the underlying mechanisms and dose-response effects of n-3 PUFAs on expression of genes associated with prevention and intervention of SLE in the NZBWF1 mouse and other autoimmune models.']"
2020-01-14T00:00:00Z,Microbiota in foods from Inuit traditional hunting,"['It can be concluded that natural drying of meat using traditional methods of the Inuit is efficient in controlling microbial spoilage, in accordance with local knowledge. Animal species and drying processes do not select for distinct microbiota and the resulting microbial composition on dried meat assessed in the current study is concluded to be a result of environmental input, emphasizing the high variability of microbes on foods and the importance of food origin. The biodiversity and microbial composition of foods stemming from traditional hunting activities in Greenland shows the potential that these foods have as carriers of microbes from the environment to the human gastrointestinal tract. The caribou rumen is a rich source of microbes that has traditionally been ingested and which has previously been shown to contain by-products of microbial fermentation that have been associated with positive health impact. The established presence of a number of edible parasites represent a diversity of food in themselves that have been lost from the modern diet in Greenland, as parasites are now sought to be prevented rather than seen as a potential source of nutrients. This work acts as an initial step towards understanding the microbial dynamics of the nature-sourced and gradually disappearing traditional Inuit diet as well as a reference point for a better understanding in future studies into the gut microbiome of the Inuit.']"

2014-03-14T00:00:00Z,Transcriptomic Analysis of the Effects of a Fish Oil Enriched Diet on Murine Brains,"[""The biomechanisms exhibited by the fish oil that facilitate neurotrophic regulation are still elusive. The knowledge gap limits our predictive aptitude in realistically estimating the efficacy of this dietary supplement. To address this challenge, we customized a diet enriched of 16% fish oil by weight, the optimum fraction of oil added to the rodent food without altering its texture from the standard lab diet. Two randomly chosen groups of C57BL/6J mice consumed one of the two diets from weaning age until their young adulthood. We sacrificed five month old mice and investigated their hemibrains using a genome-wide transcriptomic platform.Functional analyses of the transcriptomic data focused on the areas of the neurogenesis, neuroviability and neurodegenerative disorders. The GOI were clustered into four most significant functions: “Neurological disease”, “Nervous system development and function”, “Immune response” and “Apoptosis”. Together these functions encompassed 247 transcripts (∼20%) identified from 1,142 genes displaying the most differential expression between the FD- and SD-fed mice. Approximately 40% of the proteins associated with these genes are located in the plasma membrane, suggesting a biased impact of the fish oil on the membrane-associated activities. Leveraging from the mouse brain atlas (mouse.brain-map.org) we found several of these genes found enriching the brain regions (Table S4) such as olfactory bulb, cerebellar cortex, thalamus and amygdala typically associated with the motor activities, information relay and neuropsychology.In FD-fed mice, a Src-mediated calcium-controlled network was suggested to reinforce synapse that possibly operated in a BDNF-MMP-9 independent pathway. FD suppressed the transcription of BDNF exons II, which is known to express in response to stress [85]. Activated PI3K-AKT-PKC cascades operated in concert. We further acknowledged a risk of spurring depression through FD-mediated activation of mGluR2/Ca+2 [75]. However, the FD-induced long term potentiation was deemed as more plausible endpoint in cognition of the additional evidences, including the stimulation of NMDAR and downstream glutaminergic/dopaminergic/cholinergic networks [69], [77] and the elevated transcription of WNT family genes [117], PPP1R1B [76] and NEUROD6 [118]. The risk of Ca+2 -induced biased recurrence of excitatory synaptic transmission was possibly mitigated by the FD-induced NLGN1 that typically helps in restoring the balance between the excitatory and inhibitory synapses [119].FD-induced attenuation of oxidative stress and reduction of amyloidal burden coupled with suppressed inflammatory and apoptosis networks affirmed the potential efficacy of fish oil in treating a range of neurodegenerative debilities such as affective, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disorders. In contrast, the FD-stimulated neuromodulators like dopamine, choline, GABA and glutamate may diminish the efficacy of the fish oil in treating bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and suicidal inclination, which has been proposed to be triggered by the hyperactivity of the same pool of molecular messengers [105], [106]. Taken together, our results suggested a potential susceptibility of the fish oil's efficacy on the disease pathology and highlighted the need for strategic repositioning of the fish oil as a therapeutic adjuvant. Supporting our results a number of past in vitro rodent models [41] [37] [35], [36], [38], [39] reported n-3 PUFA benefits in the restoration of myelin sheath, activation of dopaminergic networks with downstream elevation of PPP1R1B, activation of synaptic plasticity and comprehensive attenuation of inflammasome networks.In conclusion, fish oil could provide therapeutic benefits for a number of neurodegenerative diseases, while there is a valid concern about its therapeutic efficacy in treating certain other illnesses. The comprehensive investigation to confirm these findings are exigent and the effectiveness of this fish oil diet should be validated by introducing this diet type to specific disease models.""]"

2015-04-15T00:00:00Z,Crickets Are Not a Free Lunch: Protein Capture from Scalable Organic Side-Streams via High-Density Populations of Acheta domesticus,"['Although it has been suggested that crickets reared for human or livestock consumption may result in a more sustainable supply of protein, this study finds that such conclusions will depend, in large part, on what the crickets are fed and which systems of livestock production they are compared to. When fed grain-based diets at a scale of economic relevance, populations of crickets in this study showed little improvement in PCE compared to broiler chickens fed similar diets. When fed processed, organic side-streams of relatively high quality, cricket populations achieved a harvestable size. Yet, whether crickets could be raised economically on substrates of similar quality and level of processing requires further analysis. The unprocessed and lower-quality organic side-streams tested in this study could not support adequate growth and survival of cricket populations. Therefore, the potential for crickets to supplement the global supply of dietary protein appears to be more limited than has been recently suggested. However, the feed quality index reported here may be useful in identifying regionally specific organic side-streams with the potential to support the scalable cultivation of crickets.It should be noted that crickets are but one of multiple insect species with potential for augmenting the global supply of protein by capturing organic side-streams and/or converting feed to protein more efficiently than conventional livestock [2][3]. It is possible that other species, such as black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens (L.) [Diptera: Stratiomyidae]) are better suited to the bioconversion of low-quality organic side-streams to dietary protein [1][6]. Nevertheless, champions of cultivating insects as a sustainable form of protein should recognize that the efficiency of any insect production system and, therefore, its protein contribution and ecological impact, will depend on the quality of the insect diet.In order for insect cultivation to sustainably augment the global supply of protein, more work is needed to identify species and design processes that capture protein from scalable, low-value organic side-streams, which are not currently consumed by conventional livestock.']"
2015-03-25T00:00:00Z,Seasonality and Paleoecology of the Late Cretaceous Multi-Taxa Vertebrate Assemblage of “Lo Hueco” (Central Eastern Spain),"['Isotopic analyses on the multi-taxa terrestrial vertebrate assemblage of the “Lo Hueco” locality (central eastern Spain) provides valuable information about climatic and environmental conditions existing in southeastern Iberia during the late Campanian-early Maastrichtian (Late Cretaceous). Seasonal thermal varibility has been inferred as the difference between temperature of the warmest months (TWMs), supplied by crocodyliforms and turtles (whose bioapatite mineralizes during the warm season) and mean annual temperature (MAT), provided by theropods (that record ingested water throughout the year). “Lo Hueco” ΔTWMs-MAT results do not point to a significant different seasonal thermal variability to that observed today. From the paleoecological standpoint, δ13C values of the “Lo Hueco” taxa point to consumption of pure C3 vegetation, fact that agrees well with bulk organic matter δ13C values from the “Lo Hueco” sediments. The estimated fractionation between sauropod enamel and diet (Δ13Cenamel-diet) is ∼15‰, lower than other fractionation values calculated for sauropods (∼16‰) and ornithischians (∼18‰), and likely indicating differences in metabolic and/or physiological processes or different utilization of plant organic compounds and/or plant parts. Since “Lo Hueco” titanosaur sauropods may have not been likely prey for theropods belonging to Dromaeosaurinae and Velociraptorinae subfamilies on account of differences in their body mass, no conclusive information concerning dinosaurian predator-prey δ13C offset could be attained. Although “Lo Hueco” crocodyliform material remains under study and no paleoecological conclusions have been drawn from a morphological standpoint, isotopic results indicate that they may have incorporated food items from brackish waters as shown by their δ13C values, whereas they avoided ingesting saline water and consumed preferentially freshwater, as suggested by their δ18OCO3 values, when compared with isotopic values of modern crocodilians inhabiting subtropical regions. “Lo Hueco” turtles show the lowest δ13C and δ18OCO3 values of the vertebrate assemblage likely indicating a diet based on a mixture of aquatic and terrestrial C3 vegetation and/or invertebrates and ingestion of water with an inland source, a fact that agrees well with their taxonomic designation.']"
2019-05-06T00:00:00Z,"Effects of cropping, smoothing, triangle count, and mesh resolution on 6 dental topographic metrics","['All topographic metrics are sensitive to smoothing, cropping method, and triangle count/resolution. In general, smoothing causes DNE, OPCR, RFI, and SA to decrease, PCV to increase, and is just as likely to cause size to increase or decrease. Relative to the BCO cropping method, EEC causes RFI, SA, and size to increase, and is just as likely to cause DNE and OPCR to increase or decrease, although DNE is slightly more likely to increase. Topographic metrics are more sensitive to smoothing and cropping at low triangle counts compared to high. There is a positive, logarithmic correlation between DNE and OPCR and triangle count/resolution, and the slope/intersection of the regressions between the natural log of DNE/OPCR and triangle count/resolution is no better at predicting diet than topographic values at a constant triangle count/resolution. PCV tends to converge to a constant value or decrease with increases in triangle count/resolution, and RFI, SA, and size converge to a constant value as triangle count/resolution increases. When resolution is held constant, topographic variables are more correlated to each other than when triangle count is held constant. There appears to be no optimal triangle count or resolution for predicting diet, and diet appears to be more correlated to topographic metrics when triangle count, and not resolution, is held constant.\nSummary recommendations for smoothing, cropping, and triangle count/resolution\nIf a dataset exists with a combination of smoothed and unsmoothed surfaces, DNE and OPCR should not be compared. Size can be directly compared between smoothed and unsmoothed surfaces, and no transformation is needed to compare RFI, SA, or PCV. We do not recommend comparing any topographic metrics gathered using the different cropping methods (BCO vs. EEC), but have provided transformation equations in the supplementary material should the original material be inaccessible. We suggest triangle count, and not resolution, be held constant as it tends to yield more desirable results. Further, triangle count should be high enough to digitally represent the entire tooth accurately, and there appears to be no ideal smoothing technique, cropping method, or triangle count for performing topographic analyses. Therefore, all these factors should be held constant in each study.\n']"

2017-03-06T00:00:00Z,"Women’s autonomy and men's involvement in child care and feeding as predictors of infant and young child anthropometric indices in coffee farming households of Jimma Zone, South West of Ethiopia","['Women’s autonomy and men’s involvement are in harmony with good anthropometric outcomes. The child anthropometric indices were found affected by the studied women’s as well as men’s intrinsic factors. Both maternal autonomy (for WHZ) and paternal engagement in care (for HAZ) were found determinants of child nutrition in the setting. Furthermore, optimal feeding, sex of the child and food insecurity were also remained significant predictors. Thus, nutrition interventions in such setting should integrate enhancing women’s autonomy over resource and Men’s involvement in childcare and feeding, besides food security measures.\nLimitation of the study\nMany factors may likely underpin these findings, and, they should be thoroughly examined in future longitudinal and qualitative studies. Based on our current analysis, we cannot reliably parse out and attribute our findings without mentioning the validity of our instruments. Though the DHS and Lamb et al., approaches are widely used, the inherent difference across territories may hamper their sensitivity and specificity in measuring such complex variables. Available systematic reviews on such topics addressed the need for optimal clarity, reliability and validity of tools used for intrinsic variables such as autonomy and empowerment in different population groups and settings [66–67]. Thus we acknowledge our efforts to measure and quantify women’s autonomy and or men’s involvement in care may have been affected by methodological constraints. The problem of measurement and interpretation arises because these variables cross cultural and multidimensional interpretation.\n']"
2015-08-13T00:00:00Z,"Influence of Urbanization on Body Size, Condition, and Physiology in an Urban Exploiter: A Multi-Component Approach","['We found no evidence of an effect of urbanization on the condition of house sparrows during two energy-demanding stages (early post-fledging and breeding periods). By using an integrative multi-component approach, incorporating morphological, structural and physiological measures from both breeding adults and juveniles from four different sites, we also demonstrated that adult urban sparrows are not energetically constrained by the urban environment. Conversely, our results strongly suggest that the urban nutritional environment is inadequate or of insufficient quality to satisfy all nutritional requirements of developing sparrows, and therefore, that the urban environments are likely to energetically constrain free-living birds during their developmental phase only. However, the long-term consequences of growing in an urban environment remain unclear and future studies should explore these questions by comparing urban and rural populations [22,54]. More generally, the study of the consequences of urban life on wildlife may benefit from adopting experimental approaches (e.g., see [19,93,111,116,126]) to disentangle the relative importance of confounding factors (e.g., food quality versus predictability and/or quantity, urban noise, pollution, predation) on performances. These experimental studies will also help ecologists to assess the mechanisms underlying organismal responses to urbanization. Finally, they will also provide unequivocal evidence to explain the recent population trends—positive or negative—of some urban vertebrates.']"
2015-06-22T00:00:00Z,Water Stress and Foliar Boron Application Altered Cell Wall Boron and Seed Nutrition in Near-Isogenic Cotton Lines Expressing Fuzzy and Fuzzless Seed Phenotypes,"['The current research demonstrated that fuzzless cottonseed accumulated higher oil content, but no consistent trend for seed protein was noticed, indicated that the seed fuzziness trait may be involved in oil and protein accumulation in seeds. Nutrients N, K, and B were higher in fuzzy seeds than fuzzless seeds, but the concentrations of these nutrients in fuzzless seed were higher in leaves than in seeds, opposing the trend in fuzzy seeds, may be due to limited translocation of these nutrients from leaves to seeds due to unknown mechanisms. The positive response of K, N, and B in leaves and seeds to foliar B application under well-watered or water stress conditions dependent on genotype, allowing for possible selection for more responsive genotypes to B application. Water-stress altered both amount and trend of seed nutrients in seeds and leaves. Foliar application of B under water stress may not increase B in seeds, may be due to limited movement of B from leaves to seed due to water stress, may indicate that the beneficial effects of foliar B under water is limited. Under water stress, the contribution of cell wall B to the total B exceeded 90%, supporting the structural role of B in plants. Foliar B application decreased the contribution of cell wall B to the total B, may be due to the non-limiting availability of B in the cell. Further research at the biochemical and molecular levels is needed to understand mechanisms controlling the distribution of seed nutrition. To evaluate the stability of the trait and its effects on seed nutrition, more lines under different environments need to be investigated.']"
2016-12-19T00:00:00Z,Site-Dependent Differences in DNA Methylation and Their Impact on Plant Establishment and Phosphorus Nutrition in Populus trichocarpa,"['In this research project, clonal Populus trichocarpa (cv. Muhle Larson) material derived from two different short rotation forestry sites in northern Germany with different environmental conditions, like P availability, was analyzed. The establishment of cuttings in full nutrition depended on their history, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms might be involved. Indeed, genome-wide DNA methylation differences were identified. Expression analysis of differentially methylated genes and promoters showed a minor repression of DNA methylation in promoters and sites close to the transcriptional starting site on gene expression with overall little relation to the P supply. It is therefore possible that the massive transient DNA methylation close to genes related to P starvation, recently reported for nutrient-solution-grown rice [5], is not found in perennial poplar, but it is possible that in the native environments where the poplar plant material was derived from, other stresses were more pronounced and the low P stress was not sufficient to induce measurable changes in DNA methylation of P starvation-related genes. Nevertheless, differentially methylated miRNA sequences and their predicted targets indicated not only a site-dependent, but also P-related expression difference. Overall, the better nutrient-supplied plants derived from Wallstawe seemed to be more adaptive to environmental stresses, including P starvation, than Anderlingen (Fig 8). Thus, site-specific and species-specific epigenetic modifications might be responsible for different adaptations to low P. Such epigenetic aspects must be accounted for plant breeding and biodiversity studies, especially of vegetatively propagated perennials, like poplar.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0168623.g008\nFig 8\n\nSchema of site-dependent differences in DNA methylation and their impact on plant establishment in clonal Populus trichocarpa.\nTwo different short rotation forestry sites (Anderlingen vs. Wallstawe) are shown; where the same Populus trichocarpa clone (cv. Muhle Larson) is grown. Growth conditions differ on the two sites, e.g. phosphate availability. DNA nucleotides are presented as T (thymine), G (guanine), A (adenine) and C (cytosine). Analysis of the DNA methylation pattern (red in DNA sequence) has revealed differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in all C contexts (blue in DNA sequence) between plants derived from Anderlingen or Wallstawe. A causal relationship between DNA methylation in coding regions and gene expression changes still remains unclear: In Anderlingen plants, the methylation rate in coding regions has no effect on gene expression (blue waves), independent from optimal (+P) or deficient (−P) phosphorus nutrition. In Wallstawe plants, methylation level in coding regions is negatively correlated with the gene expression (indicated by black dashed T-shaped bar). This observation is independent from phosphorus nutrition (indicated by neutral grey arrows). Though, DNA methylation has a different impact on DMR-regulated miRNAs and their targets: In Anderlingen plants, miRNA expression is not related to phosphorus supply or DNA methylation. Therefore, gene expression of their targets in both conditions is not different. In Wallstawe plants, miRNA expression depends on the phosphorus nutrition. −P leads to lower DMR-regulated miRNA expression (indicated by black arrows) and thereby to higher target gene expression. +P leads to a higher DMR-regulated miRNA expression and thereby to a lower target gene expression (indicated by a black arrow and T-shaped bar).\n\n\n']"
2013-06-24T00:00:00Z,Beware of Primate Life History Data: A Plea for Data Standards and a Repository,"['\nWe Need to Start Over!\nThus, the answer to our initial question is “no”: the results for Asian colobines and macaques from our analysis [63] could not be reproduced based on the other four datasets. Had we used any of the other existing datasets and not compiled our own, we would still be unaware that gestation length in Asian colobines is significantly longer than in Asian macaques. Furthermore, we would not be confident that interbirth intervals did not differ in the two taxa. These results contrast with the widely held belief that compared to Asian macaques, the more folivorous Asian colobines have a shorter interbirth interval in line with growth measures for captive primates [61], although there is some weak support (a statistical trend) for the idea that colobines have a younger age at first reproduction than macaques. Overall, our present comparisons strongly indicate that there can be marked discrepancies in the results depending on which database was used. Based on standardized variables and by controlling for a few key factors, new insights were gained about life history and dietary adaptations [63]. Together with similar trends discovered for strepsirrhines [71] it is now likely that folivory does not facilitate growth as much as had been suggested previously.\nPerhaps even the general role assumed for protein intake with respect to primate growth needs to be reconsidered. A recent study on juvenile rhesus monkeys emphasized the importance of caloric over protein intake [90]: Females kept on a low caloric-high protein (70%) diet reached menarche significantly later than those on a high caloric-low protein (19%) diet. The same effect is also described for humans in connection with juvenile obesity [91].\nMore generally, at present we do not know if the results of other past life history analyses would hold if based on data that were cleaned-up in a way described here. Clearly this will also depend on the taxonomic level of analysis. Errors of the magnitude identified above might not matter (or matter less) when primate life histories are contrasted with those for rodents because the very large differences should make for strong signals. However, the taxonomic level at which data quality issues no longer have a noticeable effect on results can only be found by trial and error, by re-running analyses at various taxonomic levels and data accuracies. It could be that in the future key aspects at least of primate life history might have to be viewed very differently, with potentially far reaching consequences [25], [92]. It could also be that new directions recently taken in primate life history analysis will have to be revisited such as interpreting differences in the scaling with body mass between gestation length, weaning age and development time (i.e., gestation plus lactation) based on metabolic effects [23].\n\nA New Life History Database\nIn the past, few data for primate life history were available and compilations seem to have been built in a catch-as-catch-can fashion. Researchers were also mostly unaware of the magnitude of the influence that conditions such as nutrient availability could have. This is still reflected in the content of most of the existing compilations, which often build on one another such as the data from Ernest analyzed here which – with respect to primates – rely heavily on the Kappeler & Pereira dataset. In the future, researchers might perhaps want to pay more attention to the quality of existing data, whether they meet the selection criteria required for the analysis planned. For example, if infant survival is not specified for interbirth intervals these data can likely not answer most of our questions. We can no longer unconditionally use what is published.\nThat said, there is a tremendous amount of primate life history data currently available, much or most of it usable in comparative analyses given adequate associated metadata. Therefore we propose building a new, publicly available database. Such a database would specify variable definitions and methods of assessment; it would provide mean values with descriptive statistics, and include metadata on nutritional conditions, infant viability and the like. Many details still have to be worked out before we can reach a standardized level and certain criteria need to be developed with time and practice. For example, when considering nutritional regimes it could be that in the end we can only distinguish between two very basic regimes such as those we did in our current analysis: namely whether or not human-made food was ever consumed.\nCertainly there is also individual variation and there is variation between sites and between species, and such a database that recorded information at the population level would identify and preserve the differences. In addition it is also reasonable to identify a “best value” (central tendency) for every population (and condition) for use in comparative analyses. We need to locate and compile those values, have them proof-read and approved by the people who collected the data, and keep the compilation updated so that future research can be based on the best data currently available. Ideally, in the – hopefully not too far – future new data will automatically be included at the time of publication. Other disciplines already have comparable structures in place such as databases like GenBank® (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank) and standards for database variables like Darwin Core (http://www.gbif.org). Such a life history database is likely to save us all a lot of time in the future and will allow for new and true discoveries.\nAs a final note: We used Asian primate taxa as example because it is the group we are most familiar with. Similar trends and issues as those raised here likely also hold for the other primate taxa and other animal orders and their databases. Try it out. The results might surprise you.\n']"

Our results applied a combination of metagenomics and metaproteomics approaches to confirm some previous observations: (i) the diet can alter the biochemical composition of the gut microbiota either by shifting the phenotype composition or the activity of bacterial cells; (ii) antibiotics disrupt microbiota biodiversity; (iii) FMT is effective in recolonizing the gut microbiota and in restoring some metabolic functions. When testing these three microbiota modulation strategies, different changes were observed in the bacterial metaproteome, demonstrating that every single change in the host environment can affect microbiota function. In addition to results observed over a short-term period of time [16,18], these findings show that a HFD has a major impact on the mouse cecal microbiota that extends beyond compositional changes to major alterations in bacterial physiology. Additionally, FMT can be considered as a new strategy to complement the conventional treatments for obesity based on healthy dietary and behavioral factors.Moreover, this study reaffirms that metaproteomics should be a complementary tool used along with metagenomics and that combining the results of both approaches can result in the improved characterization of cecal microbiota.']"
2017-07-12T00:00:00Z,A common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) prey handling technique for marine catfish (Ariidae) in the northern Gulf of Mexico,"['Bottlenose dolphin feeding morphology has evolved towards a ram-feeding mode without significant oral processing of prey; however, these observations of SCH suggest dolphins in the nGoMx have developed a prey handling technique to reduce potential complications from the venomous and sharp spines of marine catfish. The present study indicates some dolphins are targeting marine catfish when other prey is likely available, despite the additional energy presumably expended to decapitate each fish. Marine catfish in spawning aggregations may offer bottlenose dolphins a prey source with a positive energy trade-off due to their egg production and propensity for sonic activity. Generally, bottlenose dolphin diet studies find a relatively low occurrence of marine catfish, however, those data may reflect a lack of ingested otoliths due to successful decapitations or a bias towards a diet less representative of dolphins with extended movement patterns extralimital to the study population. The dorsal fin matches in dolphin groups associated with this rarely observed prey handling technique across these survey areas may indicate a need for specific studies (e.g., focal follows, remote tissue biopsy) to determine the extent to which this prey handling technique is related to factors such as ecology, genetics, or social transmission.']"

Reduced dopamine is associated with obesity (for review, [57]) and may contribute to compulsive eating [33,34,54,66]. We demonstrate that HFCS can impair dopamine function in the absence of weight gain or increased fat consumption. As reduced dopamine function has been implicated in compulsive behaviors [67,68] and reduced energy expenditure [57,69,70] and insulin dysregulation incurs increased obesity risk [71], changes in glucose regulation and dopamine function induced by HFCS may precede and contribute to obesity in the long-run.Increased consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks has been associated with increased rates of obesity and metabolic disorder, especially in developed countries that consume a ‘Western’ diet when compared to those countries with lower access [9]. Although most softdrinks are sweetened with HFCS [3], whether it is HFCS per se that contributes to this risk has been controversial [12,13,15]. The addition of HFCS to current rodent DIO models may better recapitulate modern, Western diets associated with increased rates of obesity, allowing for better characterization of both dietary-induced obesity and underlying mechanisms.']"

The disruptive effect was attributed to the presence of added BsEXLX1 proteins in the regions of expansion, as confirmed by immunofluorescence. Despite the lack of detectable hydrolysis, adding BsEXLX1 alone to cotton fibers increased surface area and relative expansion. Furthermore, BsEXLX1 enhanced hydrolytic activity of a commercial EFE under simulated ruminal conditions (pH 6 and 39°C) as evidenced by greater yield of reducing sugars from whole-plant corn silage and bermudagrass silage. A synergistic increase in NDFD of a diet for dairy cows was detected when it was treated with BsEXLX1 compared to the control. Likewise, high and medium doses of BsEXLX1 alone increased in vitro hemicellulose digestibility of the same dairy cow diet. This study demonstrated that BsEXLX1 synergistically increased cellulase hydrolysis of various cellulose substrates. Similarly, EFE and BsEXLX1 synergistically increased hydrolysis and digestibility of ruminant feeds under laboratory and ruminal conditions. While the combination of BsEXLX1 and EFE appears promising for improving hydrolysis and digestibility of ruminant feeds, results should be interpreted with caution since these studies were conducted using purified substrates and forages under in vitro conditions. Future studies should test these findings under in vivo conditions.']"

Moreover, they are less frequently obese (10.3%) than their US colleagues (up to 40%) [64].FFs must display cardiorespiratory fitness, but to a significantly lower degree than that of recreational triathletes, for example[52]. Furthermore, the present study shows a wide range of cardiorespiratory fitness among the FFs (from 26 to 54 ml/kg-1·min-1).The consequences are obvious: there is a need for diet programs and corporate training for POs. For FFs, the training skills and techniques to increase aerobic capacity and aerobic power must be improved. Finally, SC training must incorporate diet programs and physical activity (44% of SCs are overweight). The effects of interventions on lipid levels, blood pressure are inconsistent, but BMI and frequency of cardiac events can be significantly reduced [71].

The smoking cessation is undoubtedly the best approach to reduce diseases caused by smoking, but the success rate among those trying to quit smoking is dismal. In contrast, the low-intensity continuous training is associated with improved of blood antioxidants and lipids and lipoproteins profile. Intensity and training volume have been continually monitored to demonstrate the contribution of continuous exercise, in reduction of oxidative stress in both cigarette and hookah smokers. People who are unable to quit smoking could focus at improving leisure time physical activity (by continuous exercises) in order to minimize some harm caused by smoking. Low-intensity continuous training appears to be beneficial and can be performed by sedentary adult smokers in order to mitigate some smoking harms.\nLimitations of the study\nA limitation of the study is that diet during the training period was not controlled. However, study requires that participants follow the same diet in the 3 days preceding each blood sampling, and during the training period.

The complementarity of the results yielded by both primer sets lie at the species level, since very few prey species’ sequences were amplified by both primers. For instance, thanks to the use of both primer sets we were able to reveal that R. euryale, though considered a moth specialist, complemented its diet with very diverse prey. On the other hand, our results stress the constraints of the PCR-based metabarcoding diet studies, due to the biases of the many methodological procedures and steps involved in them. Due to biases involving false positives, false negatives and varying affinities to amplify different sequences, we must be extremely cautious when drawing any conclusion from the results gathered, and even when comparing results of different studies. This strong bias when amplifying prey sequences will yield erroneous or at least partial pictures of the trophic requirements of the consumers and resource partitioning among them. In this context, the use of complementary primers improves any assessment of species trophic spectrum and resource partitioning. In this case, we have seen that among the three studied horseshoe bats resource partitioning exists, mostly between R. euryale and R. ferrumequinum.']"
2015-10-28T00:00:00Z,"The First New Zealanders? An Alternative Interpretation of Stable Isotope Data from Wairau Bar, New Zealand","['We agree with Kinaston et al. that Wairau Bar appears to be a special site in the colonising phase of New Zealand and that, particularly on the basis of material culture, there are differences between individuals in the site. However, here we have argued that the stable isotope data does not support the identification of spatially coherent clusters of individuals with diets different from the majority of the population at the site. Instead, we find that dietary differences were most probably influenced by the sex of individuals and that there is no clear isotopic evidence to support the designation of a group of Wairau Bar individuals as the first immigrants. We would argue that these results tell us something potentially more interesting about the social dimensions of diet and mobility in early New Zealand.At a broad level this study has shown the potential benefits of multi-factorial analyses of stable isotope data in the Pacific Islands. Traditional single hypothesis-testing approaches often employ groups that increase the potential of finding positive results, thereby introducing a degree of circularity and decreasing the likelihood of further tests being carried out. As large-scale samples like Wairau Bar are relatively rare in Pacific Island archaeology, we advocate a broad exploration of variables that ensures the maximum amount of information is returned. The development of better strontium baselines would aid in future analysis of mobility, as may the collection of δ18O data, which, given the variation in precipitation and temperature in New Zealand is likely to be informative.']"

Dogs and pigs had diets that consisted of mainly C3 foodstuffs and were high in animal protein. Their diets were similar to those of humans at the site, likely resulting from the consumption of human food waste. However, pigs can be divided into three separate groups, including pig A representing wild boar and pig B and C two types of domestic individuals based on their isotopic signatures. Sheep/goats and cattle specimens can also be divided into three separate dietary groups. These dietary differences may reveal the presence of wild vs. domestic populations, but also indicate that some herd animals were more intensively foddered with millet by-products. Humans generally consumed a large amount of C3 foodstuffs and a large amount of animal protein, supplemented with C4 foods. Together the data suggest that people at Shilinggang developed diversified economic strategies that focused on agriculture and domestic animal husbandry, supplemented by collecting wild plants, hunting, and fishing. We propose that the subsistence systems used by different cultural groups in the various regions of Yunnan may have been adapted to local environmental conditions, resulting in considerable spatial differentiation of Bronze Age cultures in this region.']"
2015-12-16T00:00:00Z,Exploring the Potential of Laser Ablation Carbon Isotope Analysis for Examining Ecology during the Ontogeny of Middle Pleistocene Hominins from Sima de los Huesos (Northern Spain),"['Previous analysis of hominin fossils from the middle Pleistocene Sima de los Huesos locality of northern Spain showed a limited percentage of hypoplasias among the hominin population at this locality, possibly indicating that the hominins were well adapted to the environment [20–21]. The majority of hypoplasias that were identified typically occurred on young individuals, possibly related to weaning. Laser ablation GC/IRMS was used to analyze stable carbon isotope values in the teeth of hominins, red deer, and bears from this locality in order to explore the possibility that isotopic analysis could be used as an additional or alternative technique to distinguish periods of significant physiological changes in the SH hominin population. Most of the specimens analyzed displayed carbon isotope values within the normal range of variation observed across populations or over seasons. However, the sampled hominin canine had δ13C values that indicated a clear change in diet. Based on mineralization rates of modern humans, this change in diet is estimated to have occurred in the individual between the ages of two and four. An additional comparison of the laser data to that obtained from the more traditional bulk sampling methodology suggests that in order to combine the data from the two techniques strict controls are needed to ensure replicating exactly where samples are obtained on a tooth. From the data it appears that the analysis of δ13C values can be used as an additional tool to identify periods of physiological change in populations.']"

However, these features may actually be beneficial to calorie control for obese or diabetic pets, or those with special conditions benefiting from antioxidant fortification. The magnitude of reduction in digestibility does not appear to be negative for the health of dogs, but when formulating a weight loss diet the low protein digestibility in the MFD must be considered. In this situation it would be suggested that sorghum mill-feed be complemented with a highly digestible protein ingredient. Conversely, sorghum flour provided a slight improvement to digestion coefficients and might have application in “easy to digest” formula needs. The mill-feed diet had the greatest phenolic concentration, which may account for the higher antioxidant potential in dog plasma according to the ORAC method. Yet, phenolic acids in plasma did not account for this increase. This suggests that phenolic acids may be present in a different form in the blood. A future area of research should determine the optimum amount of sorghum mill-feed to incorporate in a food to benefit health while retaining overall nutrient utilization.']"
2019-07-18T00:00:00Z,"Fecal microbiota of different reproductive stages of the central population of the lesser-long nosed bat, Leptonycteris yerbabuenae","['This study focused on the diversity of the fecal microbiota in different reproductive stages of the central population of Leptonycteris yerbabuenae. Results suggest that the microbiotas of pregnant and lactating females are similar to each other and have higher abundance than juveniles and non-reproductive adults. There was no significant difference in microbiota between juveniles and non-reproductive adults in this population, regardless of the roost in which the adults were captured. Diet is considered to be the main factor shaping the diversity and function of the microbiota [8,9]. The reproductive stage of L. yerbabuenae, a strictly nectarivorous bat, is important in shaping the microbiota due to physiological changes in the energy requirements during pregnancy and lactation which are consistent with data from the literature that show increased dietary diversity during female reproduction. A relationship exists between the abundances of fecal microbial communities and the different reproductive stages of this nectar-feeding bat. This host-microbiota relationship is more evident in pregnant and lactating females than in other reproductive stages, due to the physiological, anatomical and energy-requirements changes associated with maternity. These requirements trigger a need to consume different foods, and the microbiota is strongly shaped by diet [9,13,51]. Pregnant and lactating females become more generalist feeders to cope with the increased energy requirements, feeding on resources other than nectar. This dietary modification suggests that non-reproductive individuals, which retain a specialist feeding strategy, are more efficient pollinators than reproductive females.Migration and the segregation between females and males in maternity and bachelor caves might have evolved as a strategy to guarantee resource availability during the high-energy demanding stages of pregnancy and lactation. It may be speculated that the adaptation of gut microbiota could have been important to these evolutionary adaptations of populations. The flexibility of the gut microbiota to shift from a specialist to a generalist diet could have coevolved in reproductive females to increase their fitness and guarantee yearly reproductive success. There are more questions than answers in our understanding of the host-microbiota relationship. Is there a signal that directs the change of abundances in microbiota composition? What is the ecological succession of these communities from one reproductive stage to the other? More research is needed to unravel the patterns of bat-microbiota association, to understand its implications in this species’ ecology, evolution, and life-history.']"

The analysis of the metabolites by LC-MS/MS showed the reduction in content of several amino acids and organic acids, as well as the accumulation of α-tomatine in the TAGL1-silenced fruits. The result show that TAGL1 positively regulates the synthesis of amino acids and negatively regulates the synthesis of α-tomatine in tomato fruit.

2016-07-27T00:00:00Z,"We Made Your Bed, Why Won’t You Lie in It? Food Availability and Disease May Affect Reproductive Output of Reintroduced Frogs","['The continued presence of L. aurea at the created habitat is a positive sign that L. aurea can persist in a created habitat. But the lack of breeding highlights the importance of habitat creation that facilitates all stages of a target-species’ life cycle. Due to intensive monitoring, we were able to investigate several factors that may have contributed to the absence of L. aurea breeding at the created habitat. As vegetation affects invertebrate abundance, and as nutritional up-take and disease both affect reproductive behaviour and physiology, it is likely that the combination of these factors was to blame for the absence of breeding. Fortunately, because this created habitat was used as a trial to inform larger-scale habitat creation, we have the opportunity to build upon this knowledge and integrate what we’ve learnt into an improved program. Future programs may benefit by the creation of ponds with more permanent hydro-periods and the placement of created habitat in close proximity to an extant population, planting a variety of plant species at each of the wetland zones (riparian, shoreline, and emergent) which may encourage oviposition and increase invertebrate abundance. The addition of plants that are known to attract invertebrates might also provide additional nutrition for reproduction and immune function. Recommendations to reduce Bd in the site should also be incorporated, and trialling artificial call playback may be worthwhile for stimulating breeding hormones and behaviour. This study exemplifies how monitoring and scientific analysis of a created habitat or reintroduction program can not only improve our understanding of the target species and ecological system, but also greatly improve existing, or initiate new adaptive management strategies.']"
2017-04-07T00:00:00Z,Variation in the mineral element concentration of Moringa oleifera Lam. and M. stenopetala (Bak. f.) Cuf.: Role in human nutrition,"['In addition to the high selenium concentration, Moringa spp. leaves are rich in proteins and β-carotene [4, 50], possess anti-oxidant properties [17], contain low concentrations of anti-nutrients [57–60], may be used in treating ailments [18, 61], the seeds are used as water coagulant [62], and they grow under marginal environmental conditions providing much needed ecological services (for example, shade, wind break, etc.). Moringa oleifera is naturalized while MS is indigenous to Kenya and Ethiopia. Where these species grow, the population have indigenous knowledge of their multiple uses including the high nutritive values [63]. Nonetheless, the utilization of these species as food is limited to specific localities and communities [8], they are neglected in terms of research and development, and the trees can be classed as underutilized crops [64, 65]. Agricultural and health extension work to popularise the production and consumption of MO and MS may be a useful strategy to complement efforts to alleviate dietary MNDs through dietary diversification, and use of Moringa leaf powders to fortify meals in the dry season when other leafy green vegetables are not available. In addition, variations in mineral micronutrient concentrations suggest that breeding efforts to increase the nutritional value of Moringa foliage may be successful. However, research is also required to determine the bioavailability of nutrients from Moringa edible parts. The Moringaceae belongs to the same order (Brassicales) as Brassicaceae [5] which are known to be Se accumulators [66, 67]. Hence further studies on the Se concentrations in edible portions of the other Moringa species are important to understand and exploit the potential of the family in the fight against human Se undernutrition.']"
2015-02-13T00:00:00Z,Is Yield Increase Sufficient to Achieve Food Security in China?,"['In this study, to answer the question whether current crop yield increase will be sufficient to achieve food security in China, we explored the temporal patterns of yield and planted area, and assess the level of production sustainability for three main cereal crops at county scale. Results show that yield increase have slowed down and even halted among rice, wheat and maize. Thus, keeping high yield of rice and upgrading medium- and low-yield fields of wheat and maize may be of more rationality and feasibility to further increase cereal yields approaching their potential yield. Additionally, the original findings of area change pattern show stagnation and collapse are prevailing in most growing areas of rice and wheat, making their production sustainability under great threat. By contrast, maize production is both prominent for yield and area trends in comparison with rice and wheat, especially for area. Upgrading medium- and low-yielding fields, other than expanding maize-growing areas is more beneficial in the environmental way. Thus, this integrated trend analysis on cereal yield and planted area in China provides the prototype to better understand production sustainability elsewhere in the world.Achieving food security needs long-term perspective, not only adequate food supply, but also considering nutritional content, individual preference and so on. The macroscopic strategies covering yield improvement, cropland conservation, modification in nutritional construction, and food trade are of substantial significance for sustainable development of agriculture to achieve food security in China.']"
2013-11-19T00:00:00Z,Biosynthesis of Vitamins and Cofactors in Bacterium-Harbouring Trypanosomatids Depends on the Symbiotic Association as Revealed by Genomic Analyses,"['The results obtained in this work are in agreement with earlier nutritional studies [3], [5], [9], [19] which indicated that trypanosomatids require seven vitamins in the culture media: folic and pantothenic acid, biotin, vitamin B6, riboflavin, thiamine, and nicotinic acid (Figure 12). As shown in the present study, this is related to the fact that such protozoa lack the complete set of genes that codify for the enzymes involved in these essential biosynthetic pathways. However, this nutritional requirement does not apply to trypanosomatids carrying a cytoplasmic endosymbiont. SHTs have the necessary enzymes to produce most vitamins, with the exception of thiamine, biotin, and nicotinic acid, which represent absolute nutritional requirements for trypanosomatids in general. Most of the genes related to the synthesis of riboflavin, vitamin B6, and folic acid were identified only in the symbiont genomes. This indicates the presence of complete biosynthetic routes in the TPEs with an exchange of metabolites between host and bacterium in the extremities of the pathway, i.e. precursors and end products. On the other hand, the same is not observed in the synthesis of pantothenic acid, as suggested by our analyses. This pathway might have a more intricate participation of both partners in intermediate steps. SHTs and TPEs are able to perform the conversion of the vitamins riboflavin and pantothenic acid into the essential metabolites FAD and CoA, which indicates that possibly the symbiont enhances the production of these metabolites which may be controlled by the host in a way that is not yet fully elucidated.10.1371/journal.pone.0079786.g012Figure 12\nOverview of the biosynthetic pathways of essential vitamins and cofactors in trypanosomatids.\nDashed arrows: metabolite import/exchange; dotted arrows: reaction present in only some of the organisms analyzed; solid arrows: other reactions (circles on the top of the arrows indicate number of steps and fulfilled circles indicate presence of enzyme); arrows surrounded by a gray box: enzymes possibly acquired through horizontal transfer from Bacteria to trypanosomatids (see main text). A - Contribution of SHTs and TPEs based on the analysis of gene content in the genomes of A. deanei, A. desouzai, S. culicis, S. oncopelti, S. galati and respective endosymbionts. B - Biochemical capability of trypanosomatids without symbionts based on the analysis of genomic data of H. muscarum, C. acanthocephali and L. major.\nAccording to the phylogenetic analyses, some genes coding for the enzymes involved in the biosynthetic and salvage pathways of vitamins and cofactors are in the host genome and are of eukaryotic origin, while most genes are localized in the genomes of the symbionts and are of betaproteobacterial ancestry. On the other hand, three genes were possibly transferred from bacteria to the trypanosomatid nuclei. Such is the case of the ketopantoate reductase gene (EC:1.1.1.169) involved in the de novo biosynthesis of pantothenic acid, which was probably transferred from a Firmicutes bacterium to an ancestor of the SHT host and of H. muscarum. The two other sequences may have been acquired from Gammaproteobacteria: nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase (EC:2.4.2.11), which is involved in the salvage pathway of nicotic acid, and UbiC (EC:4.1.3.40), which is involved in the synthesis of ubiquinone.Taken together, the nutritional data and our genomic analysis show that SHTs are autotrophic for riboflavin, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, and folic acid [6], [7], [9], [21]. As a result, we can assume that the shared participation of the trypanosomatid host and of its symbiont in the synthesis of vitamins evidences an extensive metabolic exchange between both partners, at the extremities of the pathways or maybe even at intermediate steps, and that this exchange has an essential role in the maintenance of this mutualistic association.']"

2016-05-25T00:00:00Z,Diet and Mobility in the Corded Ware of Central Europe,"['The study of dietary isotopes reported here does not support a model of any dominant mode of subsistence. Instead, the picture is one of considerable variability at several levels; between sites as well as within them. In spite of the cultural homogeneity in the research area, we see a good deal of dietary variation. This variation correlates with sex and mobility, most clearly seen at Bergrheinfeld where non-local women seem to have a different diet from that of locals, and also from non-local males.Compared to earlier Neolithic periods, there is a shift towards higher δ15N values, suggestive of a shift in diet and/or in cultivation practices. As noted above, there may be several different explanations for this shift, intense forms of cultivation, higher reliance on freshwater fish, on animal vs vegetable protein, or a greater reliance on milk and milk products. The latter is supported by a widespread opening of landscapes in some regions for grazing animals. Intense forms of cultivation and possibly manuring is also supported for the CW by weed composition and nitrogen isotopes.In our data, it is clear from the diet evidence of non-local women that economies with more intense agriculture existed during the CW phase, creating an economic mosaic. To investigate whether this variability correlates with cultural background, however, demands more research.Several observations can be made from the results of isotopic proveniencing. The proportion of non-local individuals is at least 7/25 (28%) at Lauda-Königshofen and 8/19 (42.1%) at Bergrheinfeld. Both of these proportions are quite high given the fact that the isotopic analysis of tooth enamel only identifies first generation mobility. If a cemetery contains several generations, these proportions are exceptionally high. Such high proportions identify a high degree of mobility among the individuals buried in the two CW cemeteries. Bayesian analysis of the radiocarbon dates from Bergrheinfeld, discussed above, suggests a use-life for the cemetery of less than 100 years, perhaps 3–4 generations. The high proportion of non-locals in the cemetery suggests that mobility continued across the generations. This is also supported by the 14C datings from the site.The number and proportion of females with distinctive strontium isotope ratios is notable and suggests that women were more mobile than males in CW society. Such evidence fits well with recent genetic information documenting more varied haplogroups among CW females [14]. Müller et al. [2] suggest female exogamy as a means of maintaining lineage identify in the face of rapid, long-distance mobility. Haak et al. [25] also reported genetic and Sr isotope ratio differences between males and females at Eulau, Germany, suggesting female exogamy. The fact that such a difference is identifiable at all also suggests that males were largely stationary, at least in the sense that they were mostly born, raised and buried in the same locality. We suggest that this reflects a stable exogamic system where women moved to their husband’s settlements, existing at Bergrheinfeld for several generations. As no distinctions in burial treatment were associated with incoming women, either the exogamic exchange involved only CW groups, or incoming women were completely integrated into CW society.Another issue concerns the possibility of long distance movement of the non-local individuals. Isotopic proveniencing is usually not successful at identifying homelands for non-locals because of the presence of multiple areas with similar isotopic signatures. In many cases it is sufficient to know that certain individuals were non-local or that mobility was pronounced in a society. On the other hand, some information regarding potential homelands might be available, particularly for the 3 high 87Sr/86Sr values in the females from Lauda-Königshofen. These values ranged between 0.712 and 0.714. There are of course various parts of Western and Central Europe where such values might be encountered, the nearest in Baden-Württemberg or eastern Bavaria. The steppe areas generally exhibit values lower than 0.712, as noted above.One of the three high 87Sr/86Sr females from Lauda-Königshofen also had the most negative δ18O of the entire group, -6.2‰. More negative values generally point to the east in Eurasia as noted in both modern precipitation and Gerling’s data discussed above. The more negative oxygen value in this female may suggest her origins to the east. Otherwise it is difficult to suggest a specific homeland for the non-local individuals reported in the present study. These higher 87Sr/86Sr values are also present in the upland regions of southern Germany and may well represent less distant places of origins for the non-locals.In sum, our study suggests that CW people in southern Germany specifically, and perhaps Central Europe as a whole, although genetically different, were similar in their economic practices to earlier Neolithic farming groups. CW groups appear to have consumed substantial amounts of both plants and animals in their diet.At the same time, there is a clear shift in diet and/or cultivation practices, the nature of which remains to be explored.Also, the substantial variation present at individual, local and regional levels is highlighted by this study. Such variability excludes any simplistic interpretation of CW economy as dominated by any single mode of subsistence. In combination with recent archaeological information for CW settlement and other studies of diet and mobility for this period, we would conclude that the CW people of southern Germany specifically, and perhaps Central Europe as a whole, continued largely in an agricultural way of life.Although mobility was relatively high, it was not greatly different from earlier groups of farmers such as the Linearbandkeramik and the contemporary Bell Beaker folk of Western Europe in general and southern Germany in particular [69, 90, 93].The correlation between sex, mobility and diet is one of the more interesting results of this study. We suggest that this may be interpreted as resulting from a stable system of female exogamy, involving various groups with different emphasis as regards subsistence economy. If some of these groups belonged to non-CW groups, as witnessed in Eulau, it was a clever long-term strategy for integrating such groups into the CW cultural network, and over time it may have led to increasing cultural homogeneity, but also economic variability.']"

While no change was noticed within the total microbial community, monitoring the active microbes revealed a tendency towards an increase in Prevotella spp. rRNA transcripts and a decrease in those of protozoa when more CS was fed to dairy cows. Although some amplicons were found to be specific of total or active microbial communities, the DNA- and cDNA-based fingerprints showed that 78% of the amplicons detected were common to both total and active bacteria. This suggests the presence of a bacterial core made of abundant and active bacteria that are essential for feed fermentation within the rumen. However, the different amplicons were distributed differently between diets, suggesting that total and metabolically active bacterial communities have different structures. By contrast, 10% of amplicons were specific to total bacteria and may represent inactive or dead cells; whereas 12% were only found within the active community and may constitute slow-growing bacteria with high metabolic activity. Similarly, excluding the 377-bp amplicon that was found in both present and active bacterial communities, the other indicator species identified were different, depending on whether the analyses were performed on DNA or cDNA samples. Collectively, these results show that cDNA-based methods are more discriminative and these techniques should be more widely used to better characterize rumen microbial populations actively involved in fermentation processes.']"

Achieving wide use of such a nutrient dense N. oculata co-product in fish feeds requires researchers to find ways to enhance nutrient digestibility. Developing highly digestible algal ingredients will both improve feed conversion ratios and reduce nutrient loads in fish culture effluents, while also helping drive algae-based aquafeeds towards cost-competitiveness with conventional feed. Towards this goal, we are now focusing on whether the inclusion of one or more non-starch polysaccharide and protease enzymes in N. oculata co-product diet enhances nutrient digestibility and retention and growth and reduces effluent nutrient loading in Nile tilapia.The aquafeeds industry will use microalgal co-product as a nutrient source only if it is a highly digestible ingredient that improves feed conversion ratios and reduce nutrient loads in fish culture effluents [11,33,34,35,76,77]. As we mentioned earlier, microalgal co-product also needs to become cost-competitive with conventional protein sources for aquaculture feeds. Fortunately, innovative business models by leading microalgae companies are emerging to meet this challenge [78]. These include multi-product “biorefinery” approaches, such as Cellana LLC’s current business model, which is anchored by high-value omega-3 supplements and high-value inks, allowing for flexible pricing of the microalgal co-products for aquafeeds and other commodity feed, food, and fuel applications (Martin Sabarsky, personal communication).']"
2016-12-08T00:00:00Z,Transcriptomic Changes in Liver of Young Bulls Caused by Diets Low in Mineral and Protein Contents and Supplemented with n-3 Fatty Acids and Conjugated Linoleic Acid,"['In summary, this trial suggested the feasibility of using low environmental impact feeding regimes (low protein and mineral contents) in livestock production without compromising animal performances and carcass characteristics. The RNA-sequencing data here obtained have broadened our understanding of the effects of variations in feeding strategies on bovine liver transcriptome, and have unraveled, at least partially, the mechanisms underlying the relationships between nutrients and phenotypic variations. In particular, the balance between glucose and lipid metabolism was affected by both low-impact diets (LowI and Nutr), while the greatest effects on liver transcriptome resulted from the addition of linseed and CLA (Nutr). INSIG1, IRS2 and RORC, key TFs controlling the expression of lipid-related genes, clearly played a pivotal role in mediating the observed effects on gene expression. On the other hand, the changes in mineral composition seemed not to considerably affect bovine liver gene expression profile. The increased supplementation with vitE occurring in Nutr could likely be related to the regulation of glutathione metabolism.Thereby, our results helped in clarifying the role of bovine liver in the biological response to specific nutrients variations. The regulation of liver metabolic processes involved in lipid metabolism may subsequently influence fatty acid deposition into the fat of ruminant products. It is clear however, that validation on a larger set of biological samples is needed in order to confirm the present RNA-sequencing findings and draw more robust conclusions about the interactions between diet and bovine liver metabolism.']"
2014-07-15T00:00:00Z,"Effect of Cafeteria Diet History on Cue-, Pellet-Priming-, and Stress-Induced Reinstatement of Food Seeking in Female Rats","['Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to study reinstatement of food seeking in a clinically relevant model that makes rats overweight by giving them access to unhealthy foods commonly consumed by humans. Female rats serve as suitable subjects for reinstatement studies, as under the current procedures they demonstrated robust self-administration responding and reinstatement effects without the need for food restriction. Studies have shown that chronic caloric restriction can cause long-lasting changes in the stress- and feeding-related pathways [54], and the level of food restriction may contribute to the differential effect of pharmacological agents on reinstatement of food seeking [15]. A potential concern when using intact female rats is that fluctuations in ovarian hormones across the estrous cycle can influence reinstatement behavior [64], [70], [71]. In the present study we did not directly track estrous cycle phase, and thus we cannot rule out the possibility that cafeteria diet histories influence the estrous cycle, which might contribute to observed differences in reinstatement behavior between groups. Nevertheless, a previous study has shown that ovarian hormones and estrous cycle phase play relatively insignificant roles in reinstatement of palatable food seeking [72]. Together with a recent study showing that the behavior of female rodents is no more intrinsically variable than that of male rodents, as commonly assumed [73], our results provide a useful procedural validation for future studies that intend to study reinstatement under conditions that more accurately model clinical observations in individuals seeking treatment for relapse to unhealthy eating during dieting.']"

From this study we know now that these species also exhibit the same pattern of environmental overlap, i.e. in both cases specific overlap indices are higher for common dolphins than for dusky dolphins. However, environmental overlap indices are lower than diet ones. Therefore we conclude that in the SMG common and dusky dolphins are mainly segregated in the habitat dimension of their niches. Segregation occurs mostly on a regional scale and it changes seasonally. The best habitats for common dolphins are located in the northwestern sector of the gulf in areas separated from the coast. In the warm season common dolphins prefer areas with temperate sea surface and in the cold season they prefer areas with relatively high variability of SST. Meanwhile, dusky dolphins prefer areas with steep slopes that are close to the coast in the southwestern sector of the gulf both in warm and cold seasons.We have presented the first study of the sympatric ecology of common and dusky dolphins. We have also described for the first time the size, social composition and activity patterns of mixed-species groups of these species and single-species groups of common dolphins in the Patagonian shelf ecosystem.

We found inconsistent evidence for medicinal effects, which may be modulated by host genotype and food environment, and suggest that effects of anabasine on infection intensity are more likely to reflect anabasine’s effects on insects rather than direct effects on the parasite. Alkaloids were deterrent in preference trials regardless of infection status; the absence of infection-induced preference may reflect uncertain benefits of such behavior, in contrast to demonstrated negative effects of anabasine and other acetylcholine receptor agonists on insect survival and fitness.Although uninfected bees in our experiments were not adversely affected by alkaloid-containing diets, anabasine had deleterious effects on infected bees. This is the first report of exacerbation of floral alkaloids’ negative effects by Crithidia infection. This exacerbation is consistent with a growing body of work that suggests the negative effects of combined stressors—including infection, diet quality, and consumption of pesticides—on pollinator health [44], and that widespread infection could have consequences for bees’ ability to tolerate phytochemicals. The reasons for variable effects of nectar phytochemicals on parasite infection warrant further investigation. Especially needed are factorial experiments that test multiple environmental factors and phytochemical concentrations simultaneously. Knowledge of the environmental factors that determine beneficial vs. detrimental effects of phytochemicals on bee health will help explain the ecological implications of phytochemical occurrence, and how these compounds can be applied in pollinator conservation and management.']"

Specifically, using this approach we provided the first indication of a zoned, functional role for the GIT in Mg2+ and Ca2+ transport and not H+ in C. auratus, supporting previous in vivo work in other fish species (e.g. [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 45]). Furthermore, this study used SIET to provide measurable impacts of digestion and diet, suggesting excess dietary Mg2+ was secreted across the posterior portion of the GIT but that transport rates during the digestion of a control diet were not altered. Finally, mechanistic characterization of Mg2+ transport along the GIT provided the evidence of zoned Mg2+ transport kinetics in the intestine of C. auratus. The transport kinetics of Mg2+ in the esophagus were similar to passive, paracellular transport, while evidence suggested an energy-dependent, saturable mechanism of Mg2+ uptake in the rectum. These are the first quantifications of ion transport along the GIT of C. auratus, and offer evidence for a novel method for teleost ion transport studies. The results suggest that careful consideration must be made when choosing ionophores, in particular Magnesium Ionophore VI is suggested for use when studying tissues and/or cells bathed in solutions containing interfering ions such as physiological salines.']"

2013-10-24T00:00:00Z,Individual Variation in Lipidomic Profiles of Healthy Subjects in Response to Omega-3 Fatty Acids ,"['Current intakes of ω3 FA in the U.S. are about 1.7 g/d out of a total of 19 g/d of polyunsaturated FA including both ω6 and ω3, with most of that being in the form of the 18C precursor ALA [6]. Intakes of the long-chain EPA and DHA are only about 130 mg/d [6]. This represents a ratio of ω6:ω3 of 10:1, whereas estimates of historic intakes are closer to 1:1 [56]. Thus ω3 FA are generally deficient in Western diets and these dietary deficiencies in ω3 FA may be contributing to the preponderance of inflammatory diseases in the U.S. and elsewhere. However, there is a lack of consensus about whether and how to establish dietary recommendations for the intake of ω3 due to conflicting findings in both observational and intervention studies. A recent comprehensive update from an expert panel concluded that a key knowledge gap in understanding the effects of ω3 FA in modifying disease risk is the ability to identify those groups of individuals for whom they are beneficial and those for whom they are not beneficial, as well as the effective dosages and formulations [57]. In the present study we have shown that a comprehensive multi-platform lipidomic approach, simultaneously measuring FA within different lipid classes, oxylipins, and lipoprotein particle size and distribution, is able to identify key differences in response to ω3 intervention. Larger studies utilizing a similar approach should address variation among men and women with different genetic backgrounds, on different background diets, and on different formulations and dosages of ω3 FA to assess the effectiveness of ω3 interventions on modifying metabolic, inflammatory, and lipoprotein profiles toward a healthier phenotype.']"
2018-08-01T00:00:00Z,Transcriptome signature for dietary fructose-specific changes in rat renal cortex: A quantitative approach to physiological relevance,"['The specific fructose-induced gene signature reported here constitutes a new type of physiologic metric for characterizing physiological phenomena. Our analysis shows that the CD method allows extraction of gene programs, i.e., co-regulated genes, from differential expression experiments. With more than one base diet, it is possible to extract information that is valid over a wider range of base diet composition. The expression changes of the fructose signature genes are consistent with fructose-induced programs of gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, ketogenesis, and cataplerosis in proximal tubules. Thus, these genes provide a solid starting point for more targeted research into detailed downstream effects of fructose metabolism to sort out the players responsible for the pathology associated with high fructose. While renal fructose metabolism is clearly implicated in mediating pathogenesis of acute renal injury [31–34], importance of various downstream events mediating the cellular/metabolic reprogramming remains controversial [50–52]. The approach of combining analysis by CD with averaging of gene vectors and the newly described “rank/deviation” cutoff method has wider importance beyond fructose and the proximal tubule. First, it has greater power than univariate methods; second, the quantitative nature of signature gene vectors allows rational integration of information from differential expression experiments with different types of dietary manipulations or with different animal or cell models, e.g., by similarity analysis. Therefore, this analysis method can substantially contribute to mapping transcriptome profiles to physiological functions. The strategy and methods are clearly applicable to many dietary problems.']"
2019-12-09T00:00:00Z,Energy expenditure and body composition changes after an isocaloric ketogenic diet in overweight and obese men: A secondary analysis of energy expenditure and physical activity,"['On the basis of the transient and what was considered a relatively small increase in EE measured in the metabolic chambers after the switch to the KD, Hall et al. [8] concluded that the results of their pilot study did not support the prediction of the carbohydrate-insulin hypothesis of obesity that such an isocaloric change in diet would increase EE. This finding has been cited as evidence refuting the carbohydrate-insulin hypothesis, offering further support for the energy balance hypothesis of obesity that emphasizes a calorie-is-a-calorie perspective [29–31]. Such a conclusion may be premature given the robust increase in EE associated with consumption of the KD as measured using doubly-labeled water in Hall et al. [8]. Indeed, on the basis of the increase in EEDLW and, especially, in EEnonchamber, the results are entirely consistent with the carbohydrate-insulin hypothesis, which predicts an increase in EE with restriction of carbohydrate intake and the resulting decrease in insulin secretion. Overnight insulin withdrawal in patients with type 1 diabetes increases basal (resting) energy expenditure, a response that has been attributed to hyperglucagonemia and is associated with increased protein catabolism (for a review see [32]). Although the chronic reduction in insulin secretion during the KD period in the Hall et al. study [8] (see also [28]) was not as great, it was also associated with increases in basal metabolic rate (as estimated from sleeping energy expenditures), plasma glucagon concentrations, and protein catabolism (as indicated from urinary nitrogen, urea and ammonia excretion). These factors, along with a possible increase in gluconeogenesis, deserve further exploration in future studies of the effect of ketogenic diets on energy expenditure.']"
2013-10-14T00:00:00Z,"Lineage-Specific Responses of Tooth Shape in Murine Rodents (Murinae, Rodentia) to Late Miocene Dietary Change in the Siwaliks of Pakistan","['Kimura et al. [15] documented, using carbon isotopes in enamel of molars, that Siwalik murine rodents experienced a significant dietary shift between 7.8 and 7.4 Ma by incorporating more C4 plants into the diet during the C3 to C4 vegetation shift. Their diets were isotopically similar until 10.1 Ma. From 9.2 to 6.5 Ma, Karnimata consistently had more C4 plants in their diet than the “Progonomys clade”. Karnimata evolved greater VD index as opposed to a constant VD index in the “Progonomys clade”, reflecting the dietary preference between the two clades shown isotopically. Here, we further explored lineage-specific responses of dental morphology to the dietary shift led by the ecological change, utilizing geometric morphometric analysis on the M1 outline. The morphospace defined by PCA of the shape data is the first quantitative dataset of Siwalik murine rodents and supports the phylogenetic hypothesis of dichotomous lineages resulting from sympatric speciation proposed by Jacobs [26] and Jacobs and Downs [19]. Tooth shape change in the Karnimata clade increased chewing efficiency for tough diets by narrowing the space between chevrons and having a transverse alignment of the three anterior cusps (lingual and labial anterocones, anterostyle) perpendicular to the power stroke in murine rodents. The functional interpretation of the Progonomys clade is inconclusive in this study, which is limited to two-dimensional outline shape and morphometric distances. Shape change in Karnimata is associated with increasing tooth size (i.e., increasing body mass) more tightly than in the “Progonomys clade”. Larger body mass accommodates low-quality food items to achieve required energy [66], [67]. Our results indicate that Karnimata was better adapted to consume C4 grasses than the “Progonomys clade” in both functional and ecophysiological aspects. Since the rates of temporal change in the intake of C4 grasses are the same between the two clades [15], selection forcing change in tooth shape was differentially greater in Karnimata than in the “Progonomys clade”.Our data also suggest that disruptive selection observed in the two clades was most plausibly explained by ecological interactions, namely interspecific competition, between the two. The morphological evolution that differentiated the two clades initiated when two morphotypes consumed the same type of resource as indicated by carbon isotopic evidence. These observations are not contradictory to the theoretical model of Dieckmann and Doebeli [70] for sympatric speciation in the presence of resource competition. Interspecific competition may have hampered the “Progonomys clade” from shape modification until Karnimata exceeded a threshold of morphological innovation.Sympatric speciation has been increasingly accepted as a likely process for the origin of sister species based on empirical evidence and convincing theoretical models ([72], [75] for review). However, the completion of sympatric speciation is often difficult to observe over the duration of normal empirical studies. Other factors in the ecological causes of sympatric speciation have not been tested and are in fact difficult to observe in fossils, but nevertheless the findings of this study show that a combination of shape analysis with carbon isotope analysis in in-situ evolutionary lineages of fossil small mammals can provide powerful paleontological evidence of the ecological causes of sympatric speciation. As in Siwalik murine rodents, the European lineage of murine rodents, Progonomys-Occitanomys-Stephanomys, is considered to result from anagenetic changes in size and dental morphology [54], [76], and a strong association of tooth shape and size was detected [33]. Direct comparisons of the Siwalik with European murine rodents or with other small mammals in the Siwaliks would provide deeper insight into ecological roles played during sympatric speciation of paleontological species.']"
2014-03-06T00:00:00Z,"The Inter-Relationship between Dietary and Environmental Properties and Tooth Wear: Comparisons of Mesowear, Molar Wear Rate, and Hypsodonty Index of Extant Sika Deer Populations","['In reference to the evolutionary trend of increasing cheek tooth height in herbivorous ungulates, the causes of dental abrasion have long been debated. Interspecific comparisons of extant ungulates have revealed that both phytoliths in grass and external abrasive matter may play equally important roles (although recent discussions give the latter a more prominent role). From analysis of extant sika deer inhabiting various environments and consuming graminoids in varying proportions, notably the northern sika deer “forest grazers,” we quantitatively evaluated the effect of graminoid consumption on MS, the molar wear rate, and the M3 hypsodonty index. We found that graminoid proportion in diets alone was correlated with MS and the molar wear rate, implying that phytoliths in grass can abrade dental tissues, at least in Japanese sika deer. Some grazing species inhabiting drier and more open habitats may ingest a considerable amount of external abrasives, which will mask the effect of phytoliths as abrading agents. Nevertheless, even in the closed forest habitat that is seen in the current range of sika deer, grass has a prominent role in dental abrasion and therefore can be directly responsible for evolution of hypsodonty. In other words, we do not need to assume the existence of extensive grassland habitats in past when evolution of hypsodonty would begin to emerge [11], [59], [60]. In extant sika deer, the evolutionary acquisition of more hypsodont molars corresponding to a higher molar wear rate may be occurring, specifically for populations of the southern lineage. However, sika deer populations have diverged relatively recently compared with the divergence of living ungulate species. Thus, inadequate duration of selection may be responsible for the absence of noticeable changes in molar hypsodonty among the sika deer populations. The divergence time between the two phylogenetic lineages of sika deer (c.a. 0.3–0.5 Mya) [55], [56], which showed measurable differentiation in molar hypsodonty, may provide the minimum estimate of time required for evolution of hypsodonty.Our analyses lend further support for the use of mesowear analysis as a paleodiet estimation method. We present the novel finding that dietary information is revealed not only by the MS mean, which correlates with the proportion of graminoids consumed, but also by the MS standard deviation, which is associated with seasonal/regional variation in diet. Dietary variation in extinct species has seldom been investigated, because (1) although seasonal variation in diet of intermediate feeders can be resolved by microwear analysis of a large number of samples [18], [30], [61], it is time consuming and suffered by high inter- and intra-observer errors [62], and (2) although sequential sampling along the vertical axis of molars in stable isotopic analysis can also resolve seasonal variation in diet [63], it is also time consuming and can only reveal variation during molar formation, which may occur over a short period in brachydont species. Investigation of the MS standard deviation can provide a first inference on whether the species in question shows dietary variation, without additional effort. It also potentially offers a way to investigate chronological change in dietary niche breadth for fossil species. Further quantitative evaluation of the MS standard deviation, for example, by correlation tests between the standard deviation of MS and quantitative measurements of dietary variation or stable isotopic values, will further elucidate the utility of the MS standard deviation.']"

This implies that using only BMI for the assessment of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases may lead to false-negatives and suggests the need to include the assessment of BF in the routine clinical evaluation of individuals at an early age, even in middle-income countries. Even though prevalence rates of metabolic disorders are low in this population of young adults, as nutrition transition is rapid and as they get older, the burden of obesity-related diseases would tend to be high in the future. Thus, early detection and prevention of this epidemic of normal weight obesity is highly desirable.']"

The study concluded that termination of EBF earlier than six months of age was associated with increased occurrence of diarrhea, fever and ARIs. Earlier termination of exclusive breastfeeding was also linked with increased occurrence of childhood wasting or underweight. The 2001 WHO recommendation, EBF for the first six months, could be the recalled child feeding practice in Ethiopia based on the evidence generated. It should be stressed on promotion of effective implementation of exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of childhood life to reduce childhood morbidities and improve child growth performance.']"

Programs aimed at improving women’s health focused on improving nutritional status of women remain of critical importance for this population. Perhaps most importantly, adequate and focused screening and evaluation of the role of infections, such as malaria, syphilis, and HIV comorbidity, shown to be a risk factor for LBW in previous studies [20–21, 23, 50], is warranted. More studies are imperative for Zimbabwe, as more prevention efforts are needed, if the goal is to ultimately reduce infant mortality and morbidity.']"

The reason for the increased Sia concentration in ageing muscle is not clear but the quantification of cell membrane bound Sia during young adulthood might have prognostic potential and should be studied in more detail. The concentration of Sia in skeletal muscle or possibly in serum or other tissues might serve as a surrogate marker of ageing. Since Sia could have a protective effect the nutritional supplementation should be considered and its effects should be analysed in future studies.']"

It addresses previous unresolved concerns regarding direction of causality through repeated measures of leg and skull dimensions. Main effects and interactions are estimated with much more power and precision than had been previously possible. Findings from previous studies in high income countries, can now be generalised to diverse urban and rural settings in Latin America and China.Consistent findings across settings and previous studies provide quite strong support for an association between adult leg length and dementia incidence in late-life, with early life nutrition most plausibly implicated as the antecedent cause. While attention has focused upon education as a modifiable risk factor for dementia, much less has been accorded to other developmental factors. Mean male adult height, after a long period of relative stability, has increased by 5-10cms since 1920 in high income countries [38]. This secular trend may, in part, explain recent trends towards a declining incidence of dementia in high income countries, which are not adequately accounted for by improvements in education and cardiovascular risk profile [39–41]. Our findings would predict a 7% reduction in the incidence of dementia with each five centimetre increment in height. Further clarification of these associations could inform predictive models of future incidence, prevalence and numbers affected, and invigorate global efforts to improve childhood nutrition, growth and development.']"

For its nutritional and chemical composition pollen is an ideal matrix for bacterial colonization and growth. Some critical moments in pollen production like the collection and manipulation by beekeepers as well as the storage can favour the spoilage by some microorganisms. Because fresh pollen samples were positive for the presence of some pathogenic species and also levels of MTVC, YM, LAB and Enterobacteriaceae were relevant a high health risk could be associated to the consumption of fresh bee pollen. Same assumptions are also referred to consumption of frozen bee pollen while dried pollen remains the safest form of consumption of this high nutritional value product.Microbiological profile of pollens is a fundamental aspect to guarantee a safe use in human consumption of this product. Many world countries have national standards for pollen, in particular, as reported by Campos et al. [1], pollen standards existed at that time in countries such as Brazil, Bulgaria, Poland and Switzerland, while bee pollen has not to be considered like food supplement within EU but like a standard food, hence subjected to standard food legislation. At best of our knowledge this is the first work conducted in Italy on a comprehensive microbiological evaluation of bee pollen, both in its fresh and processed form.From the results of our analysis it is clear that a more extensive biological hazard analysis should be conducted on bee pollen for human consumption and that biological contamination levels of areas in which hives are positioned should be taken into account from beekeepers.']"

The wasp diet was dominated by spiders typical of open agricultural land, but more wood-related spiders were collected at sites adjacent to forest. In addition, food provisioning to wasp larvae was lowest but weight of male offspring highest at isolated sites, while parasitism was unaffected by the landscape context. Overall, the studied trophic interactions provide no significant explanation for wasp abundance. Thus, further factors, such as dispersal and habitat preference are likely to play a role in the observed responses of T. figulus to habitat fragmentation.']"

In clinical practice, personality evaluations with genetic testing of this polymorphism could potentially increase the predictability of cardiac prognosis, although this needs further empirical evaluation. Although gene-environment interactions in cardiovascular diseases have been received increasing research attention, only lifestyle and nutritional factors have been considered as environmental factors in ACS prognosis research up to now [5]. The present study could be used as a template for future study designs with a more biopsychosocial approach to predict long-term cardiac outcomes in ACS.']"

The effect of fish consumption was especially pronounced. Higher annual household income and occupational complexity were also independently associated with less cognitive decline. The protective effect of a healthful lifestyle was observed only among economically disadvantaged participants. Future large studies are needed to externally validate these findings. More attention needs to be given to analyze the effects of lifestyle on health under different socioeconomic circumstances and explore the underlying mechanisms.']"

We have described that PLs isolated from stool have a characteristic profile based on diet and tumor status and that certain PL classes can be correlated to particular bacterial groups. The emergence of more affordable technologies to sequence the metagenome will undoubtedly allow for more detailed study of the impact of changes in the proportion of microbial genes for PL synthesis and metabolism on the stool PL profile. Advances in understanding the function of individual PL species are also ongoing and there is a great potential for lipidomics to inform a number of disease processes.']

Furthermore, we clarified that protein restriction is a predominant regulator of hepatic Ob-R mRNA compared to fasting and food restriction. Because plasma leptin level was not changed, free leptin level in plasma was significantly reduced by protein restriction, which may regulate leptin activity and influence appetite and energy expenditure. Induction of hepatic Ob-R mRNA and plasma sOb-R may contribute to a complex regulation of lipid metabolism under protein malnutrition.']"

The number of lifestyle-related factors and their effect on IHD incidence was more pronounced in women than in men. This suggests that programs to prevent IHD should consider lifestyle and sex along with BMI and FBG levels. Further research is necessary to investigate the effects of other metabolic indices and lifestyle-related risk factors on the risk of IHD.']"

Importantly, the most remarkable finding of this study was that diet supplementation with 0.1% TB could efficiently attenuate insulin resistance and abnormal levels of lipid metabolism caused by IUGR through regulation of mRNA expression and increasing enzyme activity, which could be helpful in finding a new strategy for early attenuation of insulin resistance and metabolic abnormality caused by IUGR in humans.']"
2016-06-30T00:00:00Z,"Early-Life Events, Including Mode of Delivery and Type of Feeding, Siblings and Gender, Shape the Developing Gut Microbiota","['To our knowledge this is one of the few studies using a statistical model to elucidate the complex process of early life colonization connecting longitudinal data and the different factors influencing this dynamic process. However, whereas currently 16S sequencing is often used to study the composition and diversity of complex microbial ecosystems, we chose to use a qPCR targeted approach, which allowed us to follow quantitatively the colonization of key taxa at species level.This study contributes to understand not only the composition of the microbiota in early life, but also the succession process and the evolution of the microbial community as a function of time and important events or ecological drivers occurring the first 6 months of life.Our results confirm that mode of delivery and type of feeding are important factors influencing this process, providing more detailed information about the timing of this influence and a deeper level of bacterial identification beyond genus. Additionally, this study reveals that other factors, which may have not yet been sufficiently studied or overlooked in the past; including presence of siblings, pets, and gender also influence this process. Even though the difference may be viewed as subtle, we need to further understand the implications of the differential effects observed and the association with potential health outcomes in the future. As expected, known early colonizers such as Bifidobacterium and/or specific Bifidobacterium species, are shown to be greatly influenced by most factors investigated in our study. Surprisingly, some of the known infant type bifidobacterial species, such B. breve and B. longum subsp. infantis were confirmed in this study to be early colonizers but were hardly dependent on the covariates studied. On the contrary, different Lactobacillus species are shown to be influenced by several covariates even though they are not normally dominant in the infant gut. In addition, our results also point out that Bacteroides is a key bacterial genus in the early colonization process, which is influenced by most factors included in the model to a larger extend than Bifidobacterium, which may indicate the need to consider strains belonging to this genus as potential probiotic interventions in infant nutrition in the future.Our results also suggest that there is at least a certain degree of bacterial exposure in utero since 77.08% of the meconium samples contained bacterial DNA.One needs to keep in mind that these results are generated using data driven covariate selection and therefore further studies are warranted to confirm these findings.In summary, this study provides new insights that need to be taken into consideration when selecting the most relevant nutritional supplementation strategies to establish the microbiota composition in early life and potentially influence health later in life. According to our results these strategies may need to differ depending on the timing of supplementation, the environment in which the infant lives and maybe even whether it is a boy or a girl, which seems to point out to the need to develop personalized infant nutrition in the future.']"
2014-09-17T00:00:00Z,Living with Aliens: Effects of Invasive Shrub Honeysuckles on Avian Nesting,"['We did not observe a preference of birds to breed in habitats dominated by shrub honeysuckles across seven study sites in central Pennsylvania. We did find a preference for birds to build their nests in shrub honeysuckles in all sites, which is in agreement with what previous studies have reported. We also found that two aspects of the parental care behavior of gray catbirds (i.e., the frequency of nest visitation and the time spend per nest visit) were different in areas dominated by honeysuckles in comparison to areas dominated by native vegetation. But those differences did not seem to cause nestlings to be in lower body condition at the time of fledging in honeysuckle dominated habitats, or to suffer more predation. In fact, mixed diets have been shown to be beneficial for many birds [28], and the high abundance of honeysuckle fruit can facilitate diet mixtures.Our results show that relationships between introduced fleshy-fruited plants and native birds are complex and not easily characterized as purely harmful or beneficial because they can include negative, neutral, or positive outcomes [1]–[3]. It is important to consider the possibility that habitats and plant communities that are novel and self-assembled, such as the shrublands that now cover much of central Pennsylvania and the American mid-west, could now be important as breeding habitat for many native bird species, and ultimately confer resilience to avian and plant communities to withstand future anthropogenic pressures and climatic changes. Our results show that categorizations such as “ecological traps” can be fallacious, ephemeral, and/or not broadly applicable, and suggest that the traditional and widespread categorical approach to invasive species management should be revised to prevent harming certain communities and ecosystems, especially areas in a process of self-recovery from heavy human disturbances.']"

Remarkably, the subset of genes deregulated in HF-fed Acads−/− mice showed an expression pattern that strongly resembled that of Acads+/+ mice on LF diet, in particular, genes involved in both oxidative phosphorylation and AMP-kinase signaling. The differential expression of brain peptide and transmitter genes known to control food intake suggest possible downstream targets leading to changes in feeding behavior (Fig. 7). Therefore these genes could be responsible for the altered feeding behaviors observed in Acads−/− mice.\n        10.1371/journal.pone.0041709.g007\n        Figure 7\n        \n          Energy-sensing in Acads-deficient mice.\n          Schematic flow diagram showing possible neural processing of cues from incomplete oxidation of high-fat diet (HFD) leading to changes in food intake. In Acads-deficient mice, a lack of mitochondrial SCFA beta-oxidation has been demonstrated in both peripheral and central tissues [9] which could generate signals that contribute to energy-sensing mechanisms. Orosensory and post-oral signals generated in the periphery in response to HFD are integrated within the CNS, e.g., neurons within the hypothalamus respond to changes in energy availability. Impaired oxidation of SCFAs within the brain could also signal an energy deficiency. Hypothalamic AMPK is then activated by an increase in the AMP-to-ATP ratio, which reflects the energy status of the cell [37] and induces reciprocal modifications of neuropeptides expression and food intake [18].

2019-06-17T00:00:00Z,Anthropogenic food resources sustain wolves in conflict scenarios of Western Iran,"['In Hamadan province, Wild prey was rarely found in the diet of wolves, being comprised by small to medium mammal species. Hamadan is then a good example of a native prey depleted area where wolves may have persisted shifting their diet base to anthropogenic food sources, mainly found at the vicinity of human settlements. In a similar study conducted by Tourani et al. [2014], foraging on poultry dumps by wolves is also reported, in this case being the main food item. Poultry farms are mandated to burn chicken carcasses within their facilities, but illegal dumping is widespread in this area. Access of wildlife to waste can exacerbate negative interactions between humans and wildlife [65].We strongly recommend that sheep herders and local communities avoid abandoning animal carcasses near their pastures, houses, and farmlands to minimize improper disposal of livestock. Appropriate management of illegal dumping of animal carcasses and garbage dumps would reduce the chances of human-wolf encounters in this scenario [28,66–67]. Previous studies on areas where anthropogenic resources were essential to wolves’ persistence [14,25, 56] have also suggested that to reduce the risk of encounters between wolves and humans, effective management of dumpsites and carcass disposal may be an important intervention in those areas. We encourage managers to undertake at the same time preliminary research and delineate actions aiming not only to reduce the accessibility of wolves to animal carcasses and organic waste, but also to restore the unbalanced ecosystem in the mid-term, improving native prey base wherever suitable habitat and Social context remains. Long-term assessment of wolf ecology in Hamadan province is certainly needed to propose optimal solutions to reduce human-wolf conflict in this part of Iran.']"
2015-05-19T00:00:00Z,"Predicting Species’ Vulnerability in a Massively Perturbed System: The Fishes of Lake Turkana, Kenya","['Local dam and irrigation development and global climate change will alter the Omo River’s flow patterns over the coming decade, with a possibility of terminating freshwater inflow to Lake Turkana, dropping lake level, and dampening intra-annual fluctuations. Our results suggest that the winners in Lake Turkana will be L. niloticus, O. niloticus, and S. schall, which together make up 40% of recent fisheries catch. S. schall has shown low predation mortality in previous diet studies on the system [1,14] and the fishery for this species could be expanded sustainably if measures are taken to avoid bycatch of other species. Unlike O. niloticus, T. zillii is a limited-specialist feeder (O. niloticus is a generalist with a non-limiting specialization for microphagy; [118]) and will be particularly vulnerable to breeding habitat changes, so these species should not be grouped by the fishery simply because they are both tilapiines. After L. niloticus and O. niloticus, L. horie is the lake’s most important fishery resource and is also one of the least resilient species, or losers, based on our study. H. forskalli is likely to feed primarily on A. baremose and related species and both H. forskalli and A. baremose will be losers in the altered Lake Turkana due to their dietary constraints and high breeding vulnerability. In general, fishery management in the region must be improved to account for potential population declines among vulnerable species and to sustainably manage resilient species so that they stay winners. Although additional research is needed to fully understand this understudied and climate sensitive ecosystem, our study serves as a robust initial prediction of how Lake Turkana’s fish community will be altered by upstream development, contributes to a still wanting store of baseline data for the ecosystem, and provides a novel use of data on intraspecific diet variation to predict sensitivity to anthropogenic impacts.']"
2015-12-09T00:00:00Z,"Niche Partitioning of Feather Mites within a Seabird Host, Calonectris borealis","['In this study, we examined the spatial and trophic segregation of feather mites co-occurring in a seabird host, as well as the role of interspecific competition in explaining these patterns. Our results on spatial niche partitioning showed that the two mite species occupy clearly distinct regions in flight feathers: Zo occurs mainly in the outermost primaries and Mb in the intermediate primaries and this pattern results from a combination of microhabitat adaptations and ongoing competition. Regarding trophic segregation, our results on mite diet indicated that the two feather mite species show little trophic niche partitioning and likely share the same host food resources, probably preen gland oil, complemented with some exogenous food resources. These results support the prediction that spatial partitioning can only occur when feather mites share the same food requirements. We also show that although past microhabitat specialization may have led to specific morphological differences between the two feather mites allowing them to inhabit different feathers, current interference competition is still playing an important role in shaping the spatial community structure of feather mites. This study also opens new and exciting research perspectives on the trophic ecology of feather mites, calling into question the impact of these arthropods on their host. Our diet results are however preliminary and should be further confirmed and refined using next generation sequencing approaches and fatty acid analyses to identify specific food items in the mite gut. Finally, by combining spatial and trophic approaches in co-occurring seabird feather mites, our work illustrates how symbiotic infracommunities offer excellent models to obtain replicate communities and test niche partitioning hypotheses.']"

2018-07-03T00:00:00Z,Factors associated with wasting among children under five years old in South Asia: Implications for action,"['South Asia has been home to the largest proportion and number of wasted children in the world for decades [14]. This requires quick and substantial reductions if the region is to achieve global targets to which its governments have committed to. South Asian countries need to focus on programs targeting the first 1,000 days, for instance taking into consideration the preconception period and expecting mothers with low BMI. As demonstrated in this analysis, there are country-specific venerable subgroups that countries can focus on to improve national outcomes and reduce inequities across the country.As argued by WHO (2014), targets to reduce wasting can only be achieved if “high-burden countries take stock of their current prevalence, projected population growth, underlying causes of wasting and the resources available to address them; set target annual reduction rates to guide intervention efforts; mobilize necessary resources; and develop and implement systematic plans for the reduction of wasting” [17]. Using data for child anthropometry from 121 surveys in 36 low-income and middle-income countries, Vollmer et al. (2014) showed that “macroeconomic growth has a null to quantitatively very weak association with reductions in…wasting” [43]. In other words, waiting for economic growth to take care of this significant problem is simply not a viable policy option.This study highlights the scale of wasting in South Asia, and its several links to stunting. We note that the underlying determinants of wasting and stunting are similar. With well-known and cost-effective interventions to prevent stunting and manage wasting, the raising number of wasted children is unacceptable. Policymakers and program designers should broaden their perspectives on nutrition interventions to ensure that investments aimed at addressing single nutrition condition (like stunting) are tailored in ways that will also contribute to tackling wasting. Separating these two manifestations of undernutrition in conceptual and programmatic terms is unnecessarily impairing progress on both fronts.']"

Our work also demonstrates that although the composition of flowering plant and insect communities changes at sites after an abundant invasive plant species stops flowering, community structure can remain relatively stable if the flower-visitor community expands its diet and utilizes available alternative floral resources. We conclude that the seasonal impacts of invasion by alien plants on insect-flower interaction networks are dependent not only on the traits of the invasive species but the composition of the native plant community.']"

The NEg in cattle fed tropical forage was 2.5 MJ/kg.The monensin association with virginiamycin showed potential benefits associated to the energetic metabolism of cattle, due to a reduced methane energy output, without difference in DMI. The methane production in the control treatment was 34% higher than in the treatment with monensin and virginiamycin.']"

Moreover, changed CpG methylation was not accompanied by alterations in transcription level. However, the effect of some minor differences in the methylation level of strictly functionally related genes cannot be excluded. We speculate that overall food deficiency activates regulatory processes that optimize the intrauterine environment for the developing fetuses. These processes stimulate the use of stored nutrients and prevent deregulation of DNA methylation. It must be also borne in mind that we did not perform genome-wide methylation analysis, so changes in other groups of genes were possible.']"

TA, up to the 2% dietary level, induced caecal hypertrophy and could act as a cardioprotective agent, as demonstrated by decreased CK activity. CP level had a greater impact on rat physiology than TA because it affected not only the caecum, but also the stomach, small intestine, kidneys and spleen. Feeding diets with a higher CP content had a hypocholesterolemic effect and additionally influenced those biochemical blood indices that might be associated with kidney physiology. However, this phenomenon is unclear and requires further investigations.']"

These inhibitors were quantified by LC-MS/MS, showing that the most potent inhibitor, MMU, is found at the highest concentration in the plant root in comparison to BMU and BBU. MMU showed local analgesic effects in an in vivo inflammatory pain model. These findings may explain, at least in part, the pharmacological mechanisms of traditional medicinal uses of the root of P. brazzeana. Our findings illustrate that plants could provide leads for novel and therapeutically valuable sEH inhibitors and that plant natural products that inhibit sEH could be valuable supplements to an omega-3 fatty acid-rich diet.']"

Moreover, the participants with higher BMI were also the ones with the worst dietary habits and the highest physical inactivity. Transition from childhood to adolescence is usually characterized by a critical decline of healthy diet behavior, and can be predictive of future pathological conditions, but is also the period where young people need to become aware about their responsibility in their own food choice and the establishment of healthy habits.

The effect of CO2 was limited to the fiber fractions of plants, whereas ozone had strong and negative effects on plant quality. Experimental diets from elevated O3 rings reduced the growth rate of female voles. The growth rate of males, however, was unaffected by GAC-mediated changes in plant chemistry. The effects of global atmospheric change on phytochemistry will alter the growth of mammalian herbivores if they are unable to compensate for a general decrease in plant quality. Changes in herbivore performance could manifest as changes in plant community composition and ultimately ecosystem structure and function.']"

Concerted prevention and control measures with a life-course approach that instils a culture of healthy lifestyle behaviours including improved diets with moderation of caloric intake and regular physical activity from childhood to older age are imperative.

2019-12-04T00:00:00Z,Myeloid cell deletion of Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator (ARNT) induces non-alcoholic steatohepatitis,"['In this study, the response of mice with myeloid cell ARNT deletion to HFD challenge was investigated. The key findings were a more than doubled prevalence of steatohepatitis (68% vs 30%), with increased lobular inflammation. This increased prevalence of steatohepatitis was accompanied by macrophage infiltration in the liver and expression of inflammatory cytokine mRNAs. No specific pro-fibrotic stimuli were given (e.g. thioacetamide, CCl4, or methionine choline deficient diet). The study used genetic controls (floxed control mice) and did not study diet-controls i.e. mice receiving normal chow. However, C57Bl/6 mice eating normal chow do not develop NAFLD. For that reason, in the ARNT-deleted mice it is not likely that there would be a strong phenotype on chow diet. Hydroxyproline was not measured to assess global liver collagen content, which is a study weakness.Myeloid ARNT deletion increased subcutaneous fat weight, liver triglyceride content and adipocyte size and worsened glucose tolerance.The alterations in whole body glucose / insulin homeostasis may result from changes in the liver, or adipose depots, or possibly skeletal muscle which was not studied in this work. It is plausible that there is also cross-talk between liver and fat to lead to NASH. A well-described example is adiponectin [46]. In the liver of LAR mice, Adiponectin receptor 2 had lower expression, but this was not confirmed at the protein level.Human NASH is associated with infiltration of mononuclear phagocytes and increased liver expression of CXCL1, MCP-1, TNF-α and TGF-β1 [47–50]. In mice fed a methionine/choline-deficient diet likewise, Kupffer cells play an important role in the initiation of liver inflammation, while recruited macrophages are important for disease perpetuation [51]. MCP-1 and TNF-α in particular have been shown to play important roles in the recruitment of inflammatory macrophages in NASH models, with antagonism or reduction of either associated with decreased monocyte recruitment and reduced inflammation [51–53]. Consistently, in LAR mice, increased numbers of cells of the macrophage lineage (F4/80 mRNA expression and F4/80+ cells) were observed while the combination of increased mRNA expression for Mcp-1, Cxcl-1, Tnf-α and Tgf-b1 and recruitment of macrophages appear to have perpetuated inflammation.The finding of increased cytokine expression and inflammation in the liver of LAR mice after HFD is perhaps unexpected considering that mice lacking myeloid HIF-1α or HIF-2α have decreased inflammation in acute immune models [32–35]. Consistent with those reports, we recently reported decreased skin inflammation and wound healing in LAR animals alongside reduced cytokine mRNA in macrophages [54]. However, it has recently also been reported that mice lacking ARNT/ HIF-1α signalling in myeloid cells have increased allergic response in both a house dust mite model and an OVA murine asthma model, which may be driven by decreased IL-10 production [55]. HIF activation through myeloid cell Vhl deletion reduced inflammation in a model of chronic kidney disease, and macrophage HIF-1α deletion increased the immune response to cancer through de-repression of infiltrating cytotoxic T-cell activity [56, 57]. These results demonstrate that in certain situations myeloid cell ARNT/ HIF-1α function can reduce inflammation, but that decreased myeloid cell expression of cytokines like IL-10 may contribute to increased inflammation and NASH as observed in LAR mice. In support of this, Il-10 mRNA was increased in LAR livers after HFD (x 2.3 fold), although not to the same extent as Mcp-1 (x 5.2 fold) and Tnf-α (x 3.2 fold). In support of a potential role in humans we have found ARNT mRNA in isolated human monocytes inversely correlates with serum cytokine levels of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and TNF-α [54]. There was decreased ARNT expression in human liver from people with NASH compared to normal liver biopsies. A limitation of the study is the lack of a fatty liver without steatohepatitis group, which we were not able to access.There are few good mouse models of NASH. Ideally, a model should recapitulate features of the human disease with fatty liver, inflammation, perisinusoidal fibrosis, and ideally metabolic abnormalities such as obesity and increased blood glucose[58]. All of these features were observed in LAR mice fed 20 weeks of high fat diet. Excitingly, there was also a substantial decrease in expression of ARNT in livers of people with NASH suggesting potential human relevance of these findings. It is interesting to note that environmental toxins which activate the ARNT-partner aryl hydrocarbon receptor are associated with fatty liver disease[59, 60]. ARNT may down-regulate fatty liver disease induction by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.The present results add ARNT to the list of myeloid cell perturbations which result in altered metabolic function [18–21]. We note that fasting blood glucose levels were decreased at 20 weeks. This was accompanied by a trend to reduced glucose during PTT, which suggested the possibility of impaired hepatic glucose production in LAR mice. In patients with cirrhosis it has been shown that while gluconeogenesis is increased basally, glycogenolysis is decreased [61]. In addition the liver has impaired gluconeogenesis in response to gluconeogenic substrates and glucagon [61, 62]. It is possible therefore that liver dysfunction in LAR livers contributed to the decreased fasting glucose.The proposed mechanisms are shown in Fig 7C. Lack of ARNT in macrophages leads to increased macrophage recruitment to the liver. In association with this there are changes in gene expression, including cytokines, and the proteins for mitochondrial class II, III and V are decreased. The results of this research show that deletion of ARNT in myeloid cells causes liver inflammation and steatohepatitis after high-fat diet. We also found mice lacking myeloid ARNT displayed alterations in metabolism and in fat deposition. ARNT is decreased in livers from people with type 2 diabetes, and this may contribute to their increased risk of NASH. These results suggest that myeloid cell ARNT may be a therapeutic target to reduce liver injury in patients with NAFLD and NASH.']"

The plasma HCO3− value, the faecal lactate amount and the faecal D/L lactate ratio constitute clinically relevant parameters that allow a classification of two sub–types of SBS patients: those having no detectable lactate in faeces (NLA sub-group), and those accumulating faecal D and L lactate in faeces (LA sub-group). In the LA sub-group, patients with high faecal D/L lactate ratio and low plasma HCO3− value were at risk to develop recurrent D-encephalopathy episodes. All these criteria may be useful for identifying nutritional strategies to prevent or alleviate the deleterious consequences of D lactate accumulation in faeces in short bowel disease.']"

However, caution is required in inferring causality owing to the limited and weak experimental evidence available. The evidence on vitamin D nutrition and low Apgar score was conflicting and controversial.Clinical decision making is largely based on experimental evidence and as a result we recommend the conduct of more intervention studies in diverse geographical settings to further evaluate the benefits of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy on fetal health and the prevention of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. Future studies should also clarify the exact 25(OH)D level that can be deemed sufficient for improved maternal and perinatal health owing to the lack of consensus in the literature.']"

Noteworthy, the primary structure of PsSC does not allow its inclusion to any known lectin family. The presence of a novel biological activity in PsSC amongst a group of carotenoproteins with conserved structure-function relationships expands our knowledge regarding the reproductive biology of these freshwater snails opening new avenues of research. For instance, it is not clear whether aposematism and/or mimicry are important defense mechanisms. More work is needed to shed light on the structure-function relationship of this snail lectin as well as on the role microbiota of a final egg predator could play on its anti-nutritive effect.']"

DNA methylomes of male and female UC are largely identical except for DMRs strongly enriched at promoters of protein-coding genes. UC DNA methylome was not strongly affected by fluctuation of plasma folate levels within the normal range during early pregnancy. However, two specific and independent copies of the LTR12C endogenous retrovirus may be particularly sensitive to changes in the folate levels and are hyper-methylated under low-folate conditions. These observations support the usefulness of UC as an alternative epigenetic surrogate of neonates compensating CB for studying environmental and nutritional effects on DNA methylation in human fetuses.']"

Despite this capacity, adherence to standardized care guidelines among children treated prior to CHAIN research activities was inconsistent. Some discrepancies might reflect appropriate tailoring of care to individual patients. Stretched human resources and stockouts of medicines, nutritional therapeutics, and laboratory supplies were the most commonly reported barriers to guideline implementation. Clinical staffing benchmarks at the facility-level would greatly enhance quality assessment and improvement efforts. Finally, health worker time requirements should be assessed when testing implementation of novel inpatient diagnostics and treatments, as it may be a critical determinant of effectiveness outside of clinical trial conditions.']"

Furthermore, breastfeeding was not associated with IQ gains from early life through adolescence for both boys and girls. One might understand these findings to support the notion that breastfeeding has nutritional benefits for intelligence in the first few years of life given that breastfeeding was slightly associated with early life intelligence but not with later cognitive growth. However because the observed effects were weak and at best modest, we interpret the findings as evidence for the lack of any benefits of breastfeeding on cognitive development from early life through adolescence.']"

The results suggest that four verified miRNAs and six putative target genes play important roles in hepatic steatosis in blunt snout bream. The results presented here are a foundation for future studies aimed at identifying potential pharmaceutical and nutritional targets in blunt snout bream. Additional in vivo and in vitro investigations are required to gain a complete understanding of the association between miRNA profiles, target genes, and the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis in this species.']"

Interestingly, the physical resilience of the biofilms without the early colonizers was the same as well. Nevertheless, the absence of early colonizers led to a significant increase in P. intermedia cell numbers, along with a significant decrease of P. gingivalis. This effect is more likely caused by a synergy between streptococci and P. gingivalis, than by a nutritional competition between P. intermedia and P. gingivalis. Hence, streptococci might possibly facilitate the establishment of P. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms. Without early colonizers being inoculated the biofilm structure appeared looser and P. intermedia became the most dominant species in the biofilms, appearing in the form of long chains of cocci that morphologically resembled the absent streptococci.']"

However, we also observed positive, but unexpected and difficult to explain, changes in the wait-list control group. Therefore, comparative lifestyle benefits for the intervention group may have been masked by undetectable weight management behaviour in the control group.

Our results confirmed the role played by granule-bound starch synthase (GBSSI) in controlling amylose biosynthesis and, conversely, the role played by soluble starch synthase IIa (SSIIa) in controlling amylopectin synthesis.

More importantly, challenging mice with an HF diet after pre-treatment with a CB receptor agonist exacerbated glucose intolerance, stimulated inflammation and increased muscle lipid content, whereas pre-treatment with LPS affected the levels of inflammation and insulin secretion but not the glucose tolerance or the lipid metabolism. These results provide evidence that the effects of chronic stimulation of the CB receptor rely on the metabolic status of the mice. Taken together, our experiments demonstrate newly discovered roles played by the endocannabinoid system in both the onset and the physiopathology of obesity and type 2 diabetes.']"

We found significant discrepancies between the TEFs of badgers and species occupying a similar ecological niche (red fox). There appears to be no satisfactory substitute for empirical studies to determine TEFs for the tissues of a particular species [11]. While it may prove perplexing for trophic ecologists, a clear understanding of the differences in TEFs between animals of similar phylogeny, size and diet will serve to improve our understanding of their specific biologies.']"

Moreover, expression of the factor regulating glucose homeostasis, PTEN, was also reduced in the grazing cattle.

In addition, a more robust evidence base, free of conflicts of interest, is needed.

Male sex, unemployment, excessive alcohol intake, consumption of Western-type diet, aging, clinic inertia, longer duration of T2DM and dyslipidaemia are important determinants of uncontrolled hypertension in the studied population. Treatment to blood pressure targets though feasible in our setting, would require concerted efforts by addressing these determinants and clinic inertia. Overall, a paradigm shift towards integrated management of both infectious and non-communicable diseases is urgently needed to address the health problems in South African population.']"

Non-dietary variables like diabetes, living alone, younger age, high SES, being a former smoker and being overweight or obese were associated with lower potato consumption at second measurement. Geography, aging, smoking, living with children and engaging in moderate or high level of physical activity were associated with higher potato intake at second measurement. The use of repeated measures design is necessary to understand the stability and direction of the possible change in diet of a population and will also give more precise estimates of the associations between potato consumption and human health.']"

Monitoring shifts in fruit biomass is important to ensure fruit production is maintained when managing plant communities for wildlife. The Fruit Count method provides an easy and repeatable protocol that allows researchers and land managers to measure fruit biomass with a small relative time commitment, while maintaining accurate estimates that are comparable across studies and years within a study. We recommend using the Fruit Count method at the greatest feasible sampling intensity to estimate fruit production. When target sampling intensities are not feasible, use of the Fruit Count method with permanent plots to evaluate trends in year-to-year fruit biomass may suffice.']"

It provides novel and comprehensive information on the effects of MGF on protein expression in mouse liver, and provides insight into the molecular mechanisms by which MGF protects against HFD induced liver steatosis and other obesity related metabolic disorders. Specifically, MGF upregulates proteins participating in mitochondrial bioenergetics and downregulates proteins controlling de novo lipogenesis. This novel mode of dual pharmacophore actions may enable MGF to enhance energy expenditure and inhibit lipogenesis, and thereby eliminate liver steatosis and prevent adiposity. It also strongly suggests that MGF has potential to be developed into a therapeutic agent preventing diet induced metabolic disorders.']"

These ameliorative effects on metabolic situation in obesity might be related to the presence of ellagic and gallic acid. As recently reported on hypertriglyceridemia induced by High-Fructose Diet in rats, ENC® contains such gallic acid equivalents as to decrease hypercholesterolemia induced by HFD [56]. All together these results show that ENC® has the potential to be used in clinical medicine as a dietary supplement in the treatment of obesity complications.']"

According to the results of the assessment, Yunnan province can be divided into three areas. The high health risk level, located in northeastern Yunnan province, including Kunming, Qujing, Zhaotong region. In those regions, lead is present at high levels in air, food, water and soil, which pose high potential risk to children receptor.The results show that the most serious pollution grid cell in north-western Qujing region, and the average lead concentration was 0.56μg/m3 in air, 319.56mg/kg in soil, 0.32mg/kg in food and 43μg/l in water, respectively, all beyond the national limit. And the estimated BLLs of children receptor (age range 0 to 6 years) in this cell were 11.30 above 10μg/dl (commonly considered as acceptable level in risk assessment practice). And the diet was the most important exposure pathway for children receptors, which accumulated lead from soil. The older children were more vulnerable to the damaging effects of lead than the younger children receptors in this region, due to increasing the time of exposure and the intake of lead. Thus the diet pathways and lead concentration in foods, specifically in those regions where high concentration lead in soil were observed, should be given priority attention for regional health risk management. However, it should also be pointed out that our risk model used conservative assumptions and some key parameters cited from literatures, which generated uncertainties to our risk assessment results. To achieve a more reliable risk assessment in regional, basic researches for the localization of input parameters and region-wide monitoring network of lead distribution in the environment are necessary.""]"

The capacity for carbohydrate and lipid digestion may be poor in the preleptocephali stage. The nutritional requirements of monosaccharides and lipids appeared to increase as larvae grow. Moreover, at the glass eel stage, the absorption of amino acids may arise from the need to produce strong muscles and sufficient energy to migrate to the rivers. In the future, more detailed information, such as what kinds of amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, and microelements can be greatly utilized by eel larvae, shall need to be further clarified.']"

Enzyme assays showed MtAAE3 encodes an oxalyl-CoA that is capable of catalyzing the first step in the degradation of oxalate to CO2. Expression of this enzyme was also found to be inducible by the substrate, oxalate. This enzyme appears to be essential in the degradation of oxalate whether from an endogenous or exogenous source. The ability to degrade endogenous oxalate was found to be important in the regulation of druse crystal accumulation while the ability to degrade exogenous oxalate was shown to be important in defense against oxalate-secreting phytopathogens. Because of these two functional roles further study of AAE3 and remaining steps of this CoA-dependent pathway of oxalate degradation could lead to the development of new strategies to improve the nutrition quality and production of crops.']"

Gene expression in the GALT of PM-fed chickens was significantly enriched with immune-related pathways, in particular ISGs, other components of the innate immune response, regulation of cytokine production and regulation of B cell activation and proliferation. The microbiota of PM-fed chickens was significantly more diverse than control chickens, and appears to be effected by prebiotics in pigeon ‘milk’, as well as being directly seeded by bacteria present in PM. Taken together, these results suggest that PM is more functionally similar to mammalian milk than was previously thought. PM and mammalian milk both have nutritional and immune modulatory components, and the ability to modulate the microbiota of the gut. This is fascinating from an evolutionary point of view when one considers that mammals and birds evolved these processes independently.']"

2015-03-17T00:00:00Z,Transcriptomic Signatures in Seeds of Apple (Malus domestica L. Borkh) during Fruitlet Abscission,"['Our seed transcriptomic data suggest that lateral fruits are ‘pre-conditioned’ to abscise, and that the effect of blooming time and fertilization as well as position inside the corymb are important for conditioning the transcriptome of the seed, leading to specific features that will ultimately decide the fate of the fruitlet according to the nutritional conditions of the plant. These seeds are thus ‘prepared’ for the stimulus and rapidly respond to it by triggering the hormonal response leading to developmental arrest. We cannot exclude the influence of developmental stage between central and lateral fruits in the differences observed. The latter are younger and this might explain some of the differences in the expression levels of the genes tested. Nevertheless, this is the physiological situation inside the corymb. Central fruit fertilization and set can condition the lateral fruits, which physiologically will have reduced PAT and more ethylene. From our results, we can suggest that most of the lateral fruits are already conditioned to abscise. This conditioning could putatively be a protection mechanism to save the most adapted fruit, the central fruits, in case of nutritional or environmental stress. Seeds from lateral fruits seem to be activating a mechanism to maintain homeostasis and avoid abscission, and eventually, depending on their position in the cluster, they may be unable to avoid triggering the signal that will lead to developmental arrest and eventually abscission. As regards the abscission process, seeds would play a role in stopping physiological shedding. It remains to be elucidated whether they, or the cortex as has been previously proposed [3], are also the primary sensors of the abscission signal as we cannot exclude the possibility of the seed-specific early peak of ethylene biosynthesis being the signal for developmental arrest. In order to establish a more precise model and identify the abscission signal trigger, further studies are necessary to determine both the nature of the hormonal signalling before 15 DAPF in these fruits and the cross-talk between the cortex and the seed. Nevertheless, our study represents an important step for elucidating the biological pathways involved in young fruit abscission, and more studies are being conducted to unravel new genes and functions involved in this process.']"
2013-05-29T00:00:00Z,"Decomposing the Gap in Childhood Undernutrition between Poor and Non–Poor in Urban India, 2005–06","[""It is an accepted fact that rapid urbanization in India is characterized by a growing poor/non-poor divide in health and utilization of MCH services. The main findings from this analysis build a strong case for multipronged policies specifically targeted to improve the health of urban areas by reducing the gap between poor and non-poor. The result of the decomposition analysis clearly shows that the children belonging to poor households are undernourished not only because of poverty, but also due to limited use of maternal health care services and poor care resulting from lower educational status of parents and poor health of mothers. If policy makers want to reduce the gap in childhood undernutrition between the urban poor and the non-poor, the problem of low use of public services, such as antenatal checkups, full immunization coverage, and mother's education should be addressed among the urban poor. It may improve the nutritional status of poor children by ameliorating the negative impacts of poverty and could reduce the gap in childhood undernutrition between urban poor and non-poor in the country. Since, formal schooling offers a long-term solution, because there are long lags between the time when girls join primary school and the time they become mothers, an intermediate solution would be to focus on literacy training for older women [66]. Improving the ways health care systems effectively interact with illiterate mothers is another possible option that can be considered [41].The findings of the study prioritize the need of the recently drafted National Urban Health Mission (NUHM). A major mandate of NUHM is to improve the health of the urban poor, particularly among slum dwellers and other disadvantaged sections, by enhancing equitable access to quality healthcare [9]. The NUHM should also address issues of mother's health, particularly of pregnant women to minimize the intergenerational transmission of undernutrition. These findings are not only applicable for reducing the poor/non-poor gap in childhood undernutrition, but also contribute to reducing the overall burden of childhood undernutrition (particularly of underweight and stunting) in urban India. In addition to targeting the urban poor, there is the need of a comprehensive nutritional strategy to reduce the burden of childhood undernutrition in urban India.\nLimitations of the study\nA few limitations need to be considered while interpreting the result of the study. First, we have not considered twin children in the study. This could have affected the results slightly as twins are considered to be generally more vulnerable to poor nutrition and health, especially those born in poor households. Second, this study could not assess the contribution due to differences in access to (physical distance) and quality of the health care services availed by poor and non-poor population in urban India because variables capturing such characteristics were not available in the dataset used for the analysis. Third, this study examined the effects of only those variables which were measured in the survey, but the poor/non-poor gap in childhood undernutrition is also likely to be affected by the variation in unmeasured sources such as disease exposure, food intake etc, which were not captured. Finally, there may be state wise variations in factors affecting childhood undernutrition in urban areas which need further investigations.\n""]"

The unsaturated oleic acid was found as the major constitute in C. tenuifolia seed oil which is comparable to that of olive oil. Furthermore, the antioxidant activity of C. tenuifolia seed oil and oleic acid in C. elegans was regulated by the forkhead transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO. The novel aspect of this study is that to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report antioxidant activity of C. tenuifolia seed oil and its corresponding genetic mechanisms in intact model organism. The significance of this study is that the findings of this study provide scientific evidences and fundamental knowledge of pharmacological application of C. tenuifolia seed oil diet and suggest the potential of C. tenuifolia seed oil as nutrient or functional foods.']"

Younger endometrial cancer survivors (<75yrs) report lower physical function compared to age-standardized normative values. If these cross-sectional findings reflect a causal relationship, this would suggest that referring younger obese endometrial cancer survivors to a lifestyle intervention targeting in weight loss, such as diet and exercise, may benefit them to maintain and improve physical function in terms to help their recovery from cancer and related treatment. The goal of these interventions would be to improve their ability to perform daily activity and to live independently. Additional investigation is warranted to identify appropriate approach to refer endometrial cancer survivors into effective lifestyle intervention to improve their quality of life.']"

Both Taiwanese and vegi-fruit dietary patterns were reflective of foods high in vegetables, fruits, legumes and soy products, and whole grains foods, and were negatively associated with CVD risk factors; while the meat-processed dietary pattern was positively associated with CVD risk factors. Hence, diet could be beneficial in the management of CVD risk factors. A priori and a posteriori approaches used to derive dietary patterns are also applicable to the study of the dietary patterns and CVD risk factors despite their conceptual differences. Public health disseminating the general dietary recommendations is likely to make a positive impact on health status of Taiwan population.']"
2018-08-16T00:00:00Z,High protein intake is associated with low plasma NAD+ levels in a healthy human cohort,"['This study has reported, for the first time, novel associations between both protein intake and the amino acid metabolite urea, and the ubiquitous nucleotide, NAD+ in a cohort of healthy middle-aged human subjects. These observations may be relevant in developing a model that explains how protein restriction is affective in promoting longevity as observed in several studies. As the activity of the NAD+ dependant enzymes of SIRT5 and PARP1 have recently been reported to increase in response to a chronic high protein diet and urea treatment, respectively [30, 34] it is not unreasonable to suggest that the consumption of NAD+ by these enzymes may play a role in the observed decrease in plasma NAD+ levels at higher protein and urea levels. However, further prospective studies are required to confirm this hypothesis.']"

The numbers of probiotics significantly increased after supplementation with anthocyanins, and the pH of the media was simultaneously decreased. An extensive range of metabolites, such as 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, benzoic acid, phenylacetic acid, and phenylpropanoic acidwere found in the basal media containing C3G. A variety of phenolic acids were obtained after the bacterial metabolism of C3G. The modulatory effect of C3G on the intestinal microbiota by in vivo fermentation will provide a firm evidence of the health benefit from anthocyanin diet. More attention should be given for further exploration of underlying prebiotic mechanism of C3G through suitable animal models followed by clinical applications.']"

This approach of HFD for sows in their piglets is novel and can be a viable alternative to alleviate aggressive behaviour among piglets during lactation. Data on the number of lesions and behavioural responses to the open field test and novel object test after weaning, did not identify differences between piglets of HFD or LFD sows. Further studies with long-term data collection on piglets and their mothers will provide valuable information about the consequences of diets in the prenatal period on the behaviour and welfare of piglets before and after weaning.']"

We present a new perspective in which the emergence of low-quality feeding modes may underpin diversification in a broad range of reef fish families. Our study reinforces the idea of density-dependent diversification influencing the radiation of clades. Moreover, we suggest that trophic shifts have not necessarily induced increasing net rates of diversification in speciose clades, but that they may have reduced declines. Species-rich clades may, therefore, have maintained diversification over time while other clades decreased when niches became saturated. Overall, our study emphasizes the importance of trophic opportunism and low-quality diets in the evolution of reef fishes.']"

This is different from the conventional view that energy is the sole influential factor for feed intake. In the present study, weight gain, carcass weight and breast meat were found to be influenced by amino acid concentrations but not energy density. This suggests that modern broiler chickens are more responsive to amino acid densities due to their increased lean body tissue composition as a consequence of selective breeding. However, plasma uric acid concentrations were reduced by increasing the energy concentration in the diet which indicated energy plays an important role in enhancing the efficiency of protein utilisation.']"
2019-03-11T00:00:00Z,Characterization of the cecum microbiome from wild and captive rock ptarmigans indigenous to Arctic Norway,['It is concluded that wild ptarmigans in these two different geographical regions (Svalbard and Norway) share highly similar microbial communities. The presence of microbial taxa with the potential to decompose PSMs reflects an ability of ptarmigans to bypass the toxicity exerted by PSMs. The broad range of GHs found in wild and captive ptarmigans suggests the existence of a versatile cecum microbiota that allows the consumption of plants with different fiber contents. Methanol-based methanogenesis seems to constitute one of the major methanogenesis pathways in wild ptarmigans based on the dominance of Methanomassiliicoccaceae methanogens and the presence of genes for this pathway. The higher abundance of methanogens in wild ptarmigans may be linked to the ingestion of a natural diet consisting of unprocessed polysaccharides that result in longer fermentation necessary to allow growth of methanogenic Archaea.']

After treatment with YNKB for 12 weeks, serum lipid profiles and disrupted gut microbiota structure were shown to be regulated. Oral administration of high-doses of YNKB resulted in significant lipid-lowering activity against hyperlipidemia in apoE-deficient mice, which might be associated with the composition alterations of the gut microbiota and changes in serum metabolite levels. These findings highlight that YNKB, as a medicine-food formulation derived from Sichuan dark tea, can prevent dyslipidemia and research can improve the understanding of its mechanisms and the pharmacological rationale for its preventive use.']"

The present study indicated that Phase II and liver lipid metabolism were significantly regulated by intake of hydrolyzed casein; the excretion pattern of Phase II conjugates and liver lipogenesis were strongly affected by protein form. Moreover, based on the present and previous studies [24,30], we speculate that the increased urinary excretion of D-glucuronic acid conjugated molecules contributed to the lower plasma and tissue glucose levels, as well as lower tissue fat accretion observed in mice fed extensively hydrolyzed casein diets. However, it is uncertain whether this contribution is quantitatively important, and further experiments are needed to confirm this.']"

A moderation effect was observed: poorer food environments were associated with better dietary quality among mothers with degrees and showed a tendency toward poorer dietary behaviours among mothers with low educational attainment, though this relationship was not significant. Furthermore, food outlet access was characterised by an overwhelming presence of unhealthy food outlets; only 1% were exposed to a higher proportion of healthy than unhealthy food outlets in their day-to-day activities. There is a need for local authorities to improve the balance of healthy and unhealthy local food retailing through planning restrictions or licensing initiatives and to build the evidence for action from natural experiments.']"

Significant differences for bile acid concentrations were demonstrated for subjects of Asian ethnicity and differences were observed for subjects with liver impairment. We showed that defining normal serum concentration ranges alone for individual bile acids may not be as useful as defining normal profiles to remove confounding factors, such as ethnicity. This data demonstrated the ability to separate out disease populations based on their bile acid patterns. The utility of combining the bile acid profiles with the analysis of bile acid patterns has the potential for differential diagnosis of liver diseases and provide a better path forward for the evaluation of individual bile acids as biomarkers.']"

Nevertheless, we were able to identify the dominant bacterial phylotypes in the vole fecal microbiota which in aggregate were remarkably consistent with the plant-derived diet of the animals. Comparative analysis also revealed the strong influences of cohabitation on the microbiota in these highly social animals. Conversely, the advantages of prairie voles as animal models in which to study social behavior could be extended towards analyses of the integration of the microbiota in the gut-brain-(social) behavior axis. Our study provides an important basis for further investigations of the interaction of the gut microbiota with the social brain.']"

The POPs accumulated more in fish muscle than in the liver, suggesting that liver metabolism may reduce the bioaccumulation of POPs. POP concentrations in Antarctica fish and invertebrates negatively correlated with trophic level, suggesting that specific biogeochemical processes may be involved in the sources, transport, exposure, and absorption for each POP contaminant. Biological variation among species, habitat interaction, diet, metabolism, and growth dilution may also affect the particularly unusual patterns of POP bioaccumulation in notothenioid fish in the Antarctic.']"

While it would not seem advisable to limit infant linear growth, it seems reasonable to recommend avoiding consistent upward crossing of centiles for body weight in infancy and childhood, at least in high-income settings. There is still uncertainty about whether the association between breastfeeding and lower BP in later life is causal in nature. However, in light of other known health benefits[44], we think that promotion of a longer duration of breastfeeding is an important public health recommendation. Further studies are needed, particularly in populations in which influences on infant feeding practice and patterns of confounding factors differ, to assess the long-term effect of exclusive breastfeeding and timing and nature of the weaning diet.']"

Additionally, the test proved to be sufficiently sensitive to detecting differences in soccer shooting ability with respect to players' proficiency level and leg dominance. As a result, the 356-SST has a good potential to be applied in both research and practical settings for the purpose of selecting and profiling soccer players, as well as for examining the effects of various training or diet interventions aimed at enhancing soccer performance. Of particular practical importance for coaches could be the fact that the test actually measures the speed of the goalkeeper motor reaction needed to prevent goal scoring. Logically, the faster the goalkeeper reaction needed, the better the performance. This measure enables soccer coaches and players to interpret testing outcomes authentically.""]"

Our findings suggest a possible predisposition for abnormal bone growth and decreased FMH in skulls of captive lions in comparison to those of wild lions (within-species comparison) as well as to the tiger, another obligatory carnivore of similar size (across-species comparison). Whether these abnormalities are related to insufficient nutrients such as vitamin A or to other environmental factors in captivity and/or to genetic factors has yet to be determined.

Proper storage and handling of Encosternum delegorguei which is a good food source for human consumption are therefore important to avoid introducing aflatoxin contamination. Use of alternative cheap materials such as plastic–lined gunny bags which are easy to clean would help to reduce aflatoxin contamination. The presence of flavonoids which were also detected in the host plant would confer health benefits of flavonoids to humans upon consumption. We conclude that the edible stink bug is a nutrient- and antioxidant- rich food source for humans especially in cereal based diets since it contains high amounts of proteins, fats and phosphorus.

At the molecular level, this was confirmed by the enhanced transcriptional response of key desaturase and elongase enzymes, mediated through the PPARγ regulatory factor in the liver of both lines; however, the final fatty acid profile of the flesh did not evidence a correlative augmentation of LC-PUFA content. Moreover, the documented genetic pre-disposition of higher fatty acid bioconversion in the fat genotype disappeared under the vegetable oil based diet regime. Dietary macro-nutrient interface is thus a critical aspect to be deliberated during the progressive shift towards plant based feeds and while analyzing nutrient × genotype interactions.']"

In particular, the relative contribution of diatoms to the diet of oysters correlates with their energetic reserves and their utilisation during the infection period which decreases the risk of disease mortality. Therefore, energetic status and food quality could have major implications for host-pathogen dynamics in marine ecosystems. Our study provides a better understanding of the factors that contribute to transmission of disease mortalities in the aquatic environment, which is necessary to build realistic predictive modelling of disease mortalities. Such models are needed as tools to test disease control scenarios that could mitigate the impact of disease mortalities and could potentially be adapted to other epizootic events that may occur in the near future.']"

Those involved in diabetes education need to be aware of the challenges in convincing asymptomatic patients about the benefits of adherence to self-management behaviour. Long-term studies on the implementation and maintenance of lifestyle changes might highlight how diabetes self-management can be sustained. Further qualitative studies should explore the different stages of change in the process of altering health behaviours for those with type 2 diabetes.""]"

Of the 20 plant materials tested, the methanolic extracts from fruits of Emblica officinalis, rhizome of Nardostachys jatamansi, flower of Nelumbo nucifera, fruit of Punica granatum, root of Rauvolfia serpentina and fruit of Terminalia chebula were selected as promising candidates as sources of potent AChE inhibitors as well as antioxidants. Among these, fruits of Emblica officinalis and Punica granatum can be consumed daily in our diet for its neuroprotective effect. Since these extracts are able to act on multiple therapeutic targets of AD, further evaluation is required to identify the active ingredients, assess their safety and bioavailability in in vivo animal models.']"

Lifetime N use efficiency of dairy cattle was shown to be dominated by MNE, the short-term efficiency of use of feed N for milk production. However, we have demonstrated important effects of both the replacement cattle growth period and the opportunity costs of disease and fertility on N use efficiency. The considerable economic cost of the replacement cattle part of the dairy herd is well established. Here we demonstrated that replacement cattle have a considerable impact in terms of farm N losses. Further, we detected specific non-diet related variables that affect the efficiency of use of N in the growth of replacement cattle (ReplNE) and during lactation (LactNE), and therefore overall lifetime N use efficiency (LNE) of dairy cattle.']"

The perceived causes and risks of LBW were associated with several beliefs in the rural community, which highlighted substantial challenges to LBW prevention and care practices. Preventive practices concerning maternal diet in pregnancy were often compromised by several misconceptions which often led the pregnant women to perform some harmful practices. Our findings have important implications for program planners, who could incorporate a focus on recognition of birthweight and associated perceptions and practices into all health policies, strategies and programs developed for improving newborn’s birthweight in rural settings of Bangladesh and other similar settings by addressing local socio-cultural beliefs and practices.']"
2019-03-06T00:00:00Z,Modern botanical analogue of endangered Yak (Bos mutus) dung from India: Plausible linkage with extant and extinct megaherbivores,"['The multiproxy data presented here suggest that the yak utilizes a combination of both Alpine meadow and steppe vegetation depending on the season. Its response to the seasonally cool climate is either its migration to lower elevations or minimizing movements at higher elevations owing to scarcity of food plants. The presence of marshy taxa and diatom in yak’s dung suggests the existence of perennial water system in the study and vicinity areas. So, this documented data might serve as a strong proxy to interpret vegetation and climatic shifts in the higher Himalaya and to correlate them at a global level. Climate change with higher average temperatures may extend the length of time that unfrozen water may be available throughout the region, providing the yak with an opportunity to extend its range. However, as a species adapted to cool temperatures, any increase in mean summer temperatures may force the species to spend more time at higher elevations, above the lusher Alpine meadows, thus reducing access to a major source of food, and also reducing its overall range.The dung of herbivorous mammals can provide a durable substrate that allows the investigation of the modern pollen data that complements the data recovered from modern surface soil in relation to the vegetation composition and climate in the region. The study of macrobotanical remains, diatoms, and phytoliths can be used to supplement the pollen database to prevent incorrect interpretation for the palaeodietary analysis, when wind transported pollen such as Pinus, Cedrus, and Abies are present in the assemblage. The elemental analysis of different elements in the dung sample also provides a better understanding of the relationship between the surface soil samples and vegetation composition in the region. This multiproxy dataset can help to understand the collapse of species and the subsequent extinction of the megafauna from the different region of the world. The generated data will be helpful for the differentiation of the temperate and tropical megaherbivorous animals in relation to the database. The diet of wild Yak existing in the western Himalayas also includes the consistent occurrence of some secondary herbs and trees beside, grasses as primary food, thus this flexibility in dietary habit could be one of the reason for their survival through Pleistocene-Holocene vegetation transition where other megafaunas become extinct.While it is clear that, yak, bison, rhinos and mammoth, are capable of feeding on the same types of vegetation, predominately grasses, and so had similar preferences in their diet, there were significant differences in their preferred habitat. The wild yak survives today, although with a much-reduced distribution. Its current distribution corresponds to the combination of the vegetation composition and colder climate that exists at the higher elevations in the Himalayan region. Possibly due to their larger size and need for greater quantities of food the larger mammoth and rhino were not able to make the transition to, this habitat. The closest living relative to the woolly rhino is Dicerorhinus sumatrensis, with the genus Rhinoceros (unicornis and sondaicus) forming their sister group [64]. This raises an interesting paradox since the high elevations of the Tibetan Plateau has been proposed as the area of origin of the woolly rhino [65]. In contrast the bison survived by a change in its diet. So, while this diversity of grazers all lived at the same time and shared a common habitat, they reflect the three ways to respond to climate change; track the preferred habitat, adapt to changing conditions or go extinct.']"
2017-01-12T00:00:00Z,Bacterial Communities Associated with Houseflies (Musca domestica L.) Sampled within and between Farms,"['The microbiota of arthropods plays an important role in host nutrition and can influence the transmission of vector borne pathogens. In the present study we have for the first time examined the microbiota of adult Musca domestica from different geographical farms with similar farming practice and manure management. Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of individual flies and on the entire fly microbiota revealed a highly diverse microbiota compared to other arthropods. Interestingly, the approach of investigating individual flies shows that most variation was found between individuals within locations and with smaller differences between locations for both richness and diversity. We recommend that the large variation in the housefly microbiota found under natural conditions should be taken into consideration when trying to establish the vector competence of bacteria for insect species, but also in epidemiological studies addressing the spread and distribution of pathogens by vector species.']"

Flavonoids in nine tissues were studied, and we found that lotus leaves possessed the highest amount of flavonoids, followed by flower petals, lotus plumules and stamens. Moreover, we determined the optimum harvest time for vegetable, tea or medicinal purposes. Overall, thirty-three flavonoids were identified, in which eleven C-glycosides and five O-glycosides were detected for the first time in lotus tissues. The detection of plentiful C-glycosyl flavonoids has enhanced our understanding of flavonoid biosynthesis in lotus. These findings demonstrate the importance of further study of flavonoid C-glycosides because of their wide range of biological activities that could prove vital in the use of lotus plumules for medical and nutritional applications.']"

Thus it is important to not only focus on underweight women but also on overweight/obese women for micronutrient deficiency prevention programs, even in higher socioeconomic strata. Improving micronutrient status of overweight/obese women is particularly important because micronutrient deficiencies may increase chronic disease risk. The findings of this study highlight the importance of targeting interventions to improve micronutrient status for whole populations, and not restrict those to populations selected on basis of specific nutritional status only (such as low BMI).Given the demonstrated health and economic costs of micronutrient deficiencies and obesity, heart disease and diabetes, it is urgent that national interventions and policies address both the trend towards increasing overweight/obesity and the on-going problem of micronutrient deficiencies in Vietnam.']"

The anti-platelet effects of catechol are related to its inhibition of platelet COX activity, TXA2 production, ROS production as well as ERK/p38 signaling. The anti-platelet effect of catechol was confirmed using an ex vivo study. Catechol further suppresses PMA-induced ROS production in PMNs, which is suggestive of possible anti-inflammatory properties. Catechol also exhibits anti-inflammatory effects via inhibition of COX-2 activity and IL-1β-induced prostaglandin production. Catechol showed little cytotoxicity at concentrations below 0.1 mM. Taken together, exposure to catechol or suitable consumption of catechol-containing food/nutritional supplements, such as marine algae tablets or plants, may be beneficial to cardiovascular health. Delineation of its full pharmacological potential requires further investigation.']"

Postoperative length of stay in elderly cancer patients is mainly influenced by pre-operative nutritional, cognitive and functional state, magnitude of surgery, length of general anesthesia, as well as postoperative complications. Patient empowerment can enhance quality of care in regards to pain, and since over-treatment of pain is particularly harmful for elderly patients, patient safely can thus be improved. Pre-operative information was received well by patients who were cognitively and physically fit.Pre-operative comprehensive geriatric assessment might be beneficial for this high-risk patient group, helping to provide a tailored perioperative management aimed at reducing cognitive and physical barriers, and ultimately improving postoperative outcome.']"
2013-03-26T00:00:00Z,Functional Monoecy Due to Delayed Anther Dehiscence: A Novel Mechanism in Pseuduvaria mulgraveana (Annonaceae),"['This study documents the floral phenology and pollination biology of P. mulgraveana in its natural range in northeastern Queensland, Australia. Empirical studies and field surveys reveal that it is andromonoecious, with hermaphroditic and staminate flowers co-occurring within individuals. Both floral morphs were shown to produce viable pollen grains, contradicting the prevailing hypothesis that the stamens of structurally hermaphroditic flowers are sterile. A novel mechanism to promote xenogamy is reported. The structurally hermaphroditic flowers of P. mulgraveana exhibit delayed anther dehisce, with pollen only released after petal abscission once the pollinators have departed. Although structurally hermaphroditic, these flowers are therefore functionally pistillate, and effectively promote xenogamy by precluding autogamy and limiting geitonogamy. In contrast with previous studies of other species in the genus, P. mulgraveana was shown to be beetle-pollinated, with petal tissue and nectar provided as nutritive rewards to the pollinators.']"

However, in all the participants in this study, none of whom received glucose during the surgery, ketone body and FFA levels rose and insulin levels fell after 2 hours irrespective of whether or not they had received preoperative carbohydrate loading, although ketone body and FFA levels were still lower in the participants preoperatively receiving oral carbohydrate loading. Although retinol binding protein, adiponectin and leptin levels did not differ according to whether oral carbohydrate loading was given preoperatively, the levels of these substances in each group were lower after 2 hours compared with levels on operating room entry, suggesting the possibility of small decreases in nutritional condition and insulin sensitivity.']"
2019-05-31T00:00:00Z,"Mannitol ingestion causes concentration-dependent, sex-biased mortality in adults of the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster)","['Mannitol caused concentration-dependent decreases in longevity to 21 days in both male and female fruit flies at concentrations of 0.75 M (males) or 0.5 M (females) and above. Female longevity was more significantly decreased compared to that of males at concentrations of 0.75M and above. Actively mating males and females had decreased longevity compared to virgin males and females at concentrations of 1 M and above. Mannitol fed to larvae did not alter adult sex ratios, suggesting that sex-biased mortality due to mannitol occurs only in adults. Overall, our results support our hypothesis that sex differences in energy needs, related to the nutritional and behavioral demands of mating and reproduction, contribute to decreased longevity in females compared to males. We further conclude that both males and females have mannitol-induced decreases in longevity when mated, as compared to virgins, due to the increased costs of reproduction for both sexes.']"

However, further studies are required to measure the effect of MGNREGA on infant and child malnutrition in different social, economic and geographical settings in India and also to delineate the observed maternal pathway. Ensuring timely and adequate payment could improve food security, and augment the protective effect of the MGNREGA. Factors such as lack of mothers’ knowledge about feeding and cultural practices related to inappropriate feeding are important risk factors of infant malnutrition. Identifying and addressing such factors, over and above the social and economic policies, is key in efforts to reduce malnutrition among infants. Therefore, policies need to focus on these factors and target the persistent problem of malnutrition prevalent in India through a convergence of development, health and nutrition policies and programmes.']"
2017-05-01T00:00:00Z,Effect of processing on composition changes of selected spices,"['In general, nutrient true retentions for the five selected spices were explored using seven different cooking procedures. Different true retentions are probably due to food types, the cooking procedures, and interactions between the two. The major observation regarding nutrient true retention was that deep-frying and stir-frying better retained nutrients and steaming showed lower true retention values for selected spices (i.e., crown daisy, unripe hot pepper, onion, garlic, and red pepper). As different culinary treatments have different effects on particular vegetable, the use of suitable cooking methods could enhance the nutrition values of cooked foods and improve overall acceptability. More investigations on the spices from different locations and harvested at different times are necessary. Also, further studies will be undertaken to comprehensively elaborate the true retention of different nutrients of spices with other ingredients.']"

In the present study children in the age group of 6–15 years (mostly school going children) accounted for 83.84% of 229 cases of NCC detected by seizure disorder, clinical and imaging techniques. Poisson regression analysis showed a statistically significant decline in the incidence of NCC cases from 2003 to 2015. This result is very interesting and is probably due to improvement of health facilities like hand washing and construction of toilets in schools and houses; Nonetheless implementation of the School Health Nutrition Program by the Child Health Division, under the Department of Health Services of Ministry of Health and Population was probably very important and should be further evaluated together with improved health education and sanitary infrastructure, which might have also contributed to the reduction in the incidence of NCC in children in Nepal.']"

Moreover, based on data collected from our cultural characterization of W83Δ514, our hypothesis is that PG_RS02100 plays a role, directly or indirectly, in cell surface composition, especially the acquisition of heme.Future studies will investigate the contribution of PG_RS02100 in intracellular survival in which the nutritional conditions can vary significantly, depending on the length of infection and the host cell type. We also intend to investigate whether or not other phenotypic changes have occurred associated with the cell surface, such as its ability to form biofilm and excrete capsule polymers, which would impact P. gingivalis’ ability to colonize the oral cavity and survive environmental stress.']"
2014-01-22T00:00:00Z,Effects of Marine and Freshwater Macroalgae on In Vitro Total Gas and Methane Production,"['This study provides an extensive quantitative and qualitative assessment of tropical macroalgae to identify suitable species for the mitigation of enteric CH4 emissions. All species demonstrated potential for this purpose, producing less CH4 than DCS. Dictyota and Asparagopsis were the most promising species reducing CH4 output by 92.2% and 98.9% respectively, after 72 h incubation. However, these species also affected fermentation, decreasing the total VFA concentration. Due to their effectiveness, it is likely that lower concentration can inhibit CH4 production and minimize their effects on anaerobic fermentation. In contrast, other species, in particular freshwater macroalgae, may decrease methane output at higher doses and maintain nutritional equivalency to traditional feed components. Further, studies are under way to identify the optimum concentration and algae combinations that will reduce CH4 without affecting fermentation and eventually evaluate the reduction of enteric methane by macroalgae in vivo.']"

Urinary creatinine concentration is a useful tool, easy to apply routinely. Reference values provided by age, gender, and GFR level might help clinicians to identify individuals who may need both special interventions, including nutritional or exercise advice, and monitoring of their response to these interventions. The decrease of urinary creatinine excretion with GFR decline also questions the accuracy of normalizing for creatininuria when estimating urine analytes concentration which may be overestimated in CKD patients with reduced muscle mass.']"

We provide evidence demonstrating that the number of successful and total passes, number of successful dribbles and the time that the ball was in play, reduced by more than 20% in matches that required extra-time to be played; particularly in the last 15-min of extra-time. Although the current study was unable to elucidate the specific reasons for these findings, coaches and conditioning staff could use this information to inform team tactics and technical training sessions. Implementation of strategies that seek to minimise such occurrences (e.g., substitutions, aerobic and anaerobic conditioning programs and nutritional supplementation protocols [22] etc.) should be considered; however, the efficacy of such strategies remains to be confirmed when 120 min of actual match-play is performed.']"

These findings highlight the need for a better understanding of the reasons behind such a high prevalence of low GWG in rural Mangochi and how to improve the situation. There was a large discrepancy between the rates of pre-pregnancy underweight (5.9%) and low average WWG (71.8%), suggesting that factors other than lack of food contributes to low WWG. Therefore, programs should aim at investigating other underlying factors such as maternal infections during pregnancy that may impair appetite. Nevertheless, linear associations between pre-pregnancy BMI and birth weight and child head circumference, and increased risk of stunting among women with low pre-pregnancy BMI suggest that the importance of adequate nutrition in the pre-pregnancy period shouldn’t be overlooked.']"
2012-07-03T00:00:00Z,The Impact of Transnational “Big Food” Companies on the South: A View from Brazil,"['This essay is based on our experience in Brazil, a large country that, together with many other countries in the South, still retains its long-established food systems and thus dietary patterns. By contrast, the traditional food systems of fully industrialized high-income countries like the US and the UK were largely displaced generations ago.As a result, the views of many commentators and policy-makers in the South are in sharp contrast with their counterparts in the North. In countries like the US, the general tendency is to deal with food, nutrition, and public health in isolation as matters largely of information, education, and “individual lifestyle adjustments” designed to reduce the risk of various disabilities and diseases. But in Brazil and other countries in the South, food is seen by most independent scholars and policy-makers as part of a much broader discourse that involves general well-being, the family, friendship, commensality, culture, sustainable livelihoods, environmental preservation, national identity and sovereignty, as well as personal and public health.In the North, the prevailing political and economic ideology, which has developed rapidly since the 1980s, has involved abandonment by governments of policies and actions designed to protect public health and public goods to private corporations. During this process of privatization and globalization, leading corporations have become transnationals.Governments and other powerful and influential institutions, and also research and public health institutions, now need to examine and document the impact on the South of Big Food and Big Snack and their associated and supportive international financial and economic organizations on public health, and also on regional and national nature and culture, independence, and identity. This work must not inhibit the implementation of policies and actions that are needed now; importantly, once enacted, the impact of these essential policies and actions needs to be carefully monitored.Brazil is one of the leading countries in the South. It has substantial remaining natural resources, and its governments at federal, state, and municipal levels remain able to govern. We propose, therefore, that the Brazilian experience provides a basis for the design of rational, comprehensive, and effective public health policies and actions designed to protect and promote nutrition in all its senses.']"

Given that the site has a large user population spread across the country and there are known links between food consumption and obesity incidence, the interaction data might be useful in providing readily accessible and up-to-date information on obesity incidence.\nFindings\nOur findings can be summarised as follows:\n\n\nWe demonstrate significant and meaningful (i.e. sensibly interpretable) relationships between the nutritional properties of bookmarked recipes (sugar content, fat content and a combined FSA-score for recipes) and obesity incidence.\n\n\nAs our dataset spans a 9 year time period we show the stability of such data as predictors.\n\n\nWe show that temporal patterns are also important with obesity rate increasing overall over time. We do acknowledge, however, that there are counties and states for which this is not the case.\n\n\nThe geographical differences in obesity patterns mean that it is also important to account for these in the modeling process.\n\n\nThe good fit achieved by our models suggests that combining interaction data, geographical data and temporal data can be a useful in monitoring obesity incidence.\n\n\n\nLimitations\nThere are several limitations to the analyses we have presented and we wish to acknowledge these directly.\n\n\nThe analyses relate only to the United States and in particular to one food portal—Allrecipes.com. There is no evidence that the findings would be repeated with other websites or in other countries.\n\n\nThe user demographics of Allrecipes.com are skewed in general towards wealthy and densely populated areas. The socio-economic factors relating to obesity are well-documented—higher rates are found among groups with lower educational and income levels, among racial and ethnic minorities, and in high-poverty areas [64]. Although the modeling approaches applied are typically robust to these kinds of issues, the data available may have restricted the quality of the fit achieved.\n\n\nWe restricted our focus to four micro/macro-nutritional components (fat, saturated-fat, sugar and sodium) as well as the FSA metric combining these. Other interesting variables we may have investigated include the WHO metric [48], which accounts for additional properties such as Fiber and Carbohydrates. The USDA Healthy Eating Index (HEI) [69] also encompasses different aspects in the model such as vegetables, fruits, etc.\n\n\n\nFuture work\nWe are currently extending and planning to extend our work in numerous ways:\n\n\nWe are extending our models to include other interactive features (ratings, comment sentiment etc.) to establish if these offer better or additional insight into obesity incidence. In addition, we will investigate the use of nonlinear hierarchical models [70] to better account for the not strictly linear nature of the relations between nutritional elements and outcome variables such as obesity or diabetes.\n\n\nWe are also examining the WHO [66] and HEI [69] metrics to see if these offer additional utility.\n\n\nWe are investigating the possibility of repeating our analyses with other data sources. In particular we hope to repeat the analyses for data in a different country.\n\n\nWe hope to investigate whether interaction data from Allrecipes.com can be combined with other interaction sources, such as longitudinal social media content. The intuition here is that these sources may offer different and complementary insight.\n\n\nWe plan to develop more complex models to investigate the relation of climate. The intuition being that people living in locations with colder climates may be prone to eating more caloric food than people in warmer regions, without this implying larger obesity or diabetes levels. Analyzing this relation more closely might help understanding the effect of geographical factors.\n\n\n']"

No other significant changes were found in cardiovascular and respiratory admission rates following the smoking ban. Further research that accounts for individual level confounders such as co-morbidities, diet, physical activity levels and smoking status and environmental factors such as air pollution and climate would provide further evidence for the benefits of smoke-free laws in preventing acute care hospitalizations. The predicted reduced monthly AMI admissions and for angina in men demonstrate that, even when hospitalization rates are increasing, public health interventions can lower the expected rate of hospitalizations.']"

The clinical implication could be that hyperleptinemia in SMA patients indicates a change in energy metabolism that directly leads to hypermetabolism. The necessity to start a high-energy diet in SMA patients could be guided by the measurement of leptin.\nLeptin could also serve as a biochemical marker for disease progression. The development of hyperleptinemia in the disease course should be studied in a longitudinal multicentre study by recruiting a larger group of patients.\nDue to the upcoming medical treatment options and the good standard of care program, SMA patients are getting older. Increased abdominal fat tissue, hirsutism and premature pubarche, which are more often seen in children with SMA type I-III, constitute risk factors for developing a metabolic syndrome. Medical follow-up of these patients from childhood up to adulthood should take this into account.\n']"

However, under certain conditions it can present pathogenicity against C. capitata. The pathogenicity of P. rettgeri against C. capitata is dose-dependent. Thus, P. rettgeri can be considered as a potential pathogen of C. capitata. To date, there have been few studies on the complex associations between the medfly and its symbionts or on the molecular mechanisms of the insect’s immune response. The composition of intestinal microbiota is of prime importance for the fitness of sterile insects. Rearing stressors could impair this composition as is the case with the increase in the level of Providencia sp. or Pseudomonas sp. Enrichment with probiotics of the larval diet or at the adult stage as mentioned in recent studies could repair this imbalance and is recommended in insectaries. Virulence factors and toxins involved may provide a pathway for the development of biocontrol methods. All this requires improved knowledge of insect pathology.']"

For children of 11 years and over agreement, with weighed food diaries, was as good as that of their parents. This is an important finding as children of this age are becoming increasingly autonomous and may consume a substantial proportion of their intake away from their parents. It is recognised that portion size estimation does result in some loss of accuracy and precision in measures of amount consumed compared with weighing of foods, however, this is offset by a reduced respondent burden and so arguably a reduced impact on the respondent’s habitual diet. The YPFA provides a method that significantly improves the estimation of weights compared with the use of adult food photographs[12] with children[32, 33]. The Young Person’s Food Atlas offers an alternative to the weighed intake in this age group.']"

Nitrogen and Zn isotopic compositions were negatively correlated but walruses did not fall on the regression line. By combining these analyses with classic isotopic dietary tracers, we realised that this pattern could be explained by the mobility of walruses, which would not necessarily belong to the same food web for some or most of the year. Unlike C and N isotopes, the range of δ66Zn values observed in terrestrial and marine mammals is similar. Thus, δ66Zn adds complementary information to other dietary indicators such as δ13C. Future dietary and trophic ecology applications might, however, require working on low mobility individuals as a provenance factor is suspected in the Zn isotopic signature of bone. On the other hand, the δ66Zn values could be an additional provenance indicator to complement C and N isotope measurements in marine environments.']"
2016-05-03T00:00:00Z,Variability of Bacterial Communities in the Moth Heliothis virescens Indicates Transient Association with the Host,"['The huge variability of bacterial communities that we found between life stages, diets, biological replicates and field and lab populations indicates that the major part of the bacterial communities that we identified in the gut of H. virescens is of a transient nature and only loosely associated with its host. In fact, the bacterial communities seem to be entirely restructured during metamorphosis. Our results further suggest that bacterial communities are not transmitted at a significant rate from mothers to eggs in H. virescens. Based on these results, it is doubtful that particular bacterial strains that we have identified form a unit of selection with its host. It is further unlikely that a long-term mutualistic symbiosis between H. virescens and bacteria that could facilitate host plant use and adaptation has evolved.

This finding stresses the importance of including field populations when bacterial communities of an organism are to be characterized.']"

Although most of the more commonly eaten food plants were locally rare, tortoises employed effective search strategies to locate these food resources. Desert tortoises in this region focused much of their foraging efforts on several locally-rare leguminous species, which may play an important role in tortoise health especially in their growth [17, 18]. Another novel finding of this study is that much of tortoise diet was comprised of herbaceous perennials, which in contrast to the more abundant winter-spring annuals, may help sustain tortoise populations during drought years. Any factor that directly or indirectly reduces the availability of key tortoise food plants (e.g., offroad vehicle use, livestock grazing, or climate change) may negatively affect tortoise populations.']"

The RNA-Seq reads were assembled and clustered into 66,815 unigenes, of which 37,292 have been annotated. The five samples could be clustered into three major groups according to gene expression patterns and the differentially expressed genes between adjacent samples were also identified. By GO term enrichment analysis, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis and functional gene profiling, the physiological changes during shrimp metamorphosis could be better understood especially histogenesis, diet transition, muscle development and exoskeleton reconstruction. This is the first study that characterized the integrated transcriptome profiles during early development of penaeid shrimp. These findings will serve as significant references for shrimp developmental biology and aquaculture research.']"

The sensitivity to HCD was correlated to that under HFD, but not strongly, indicating that HCD- and HFD-sensitivities do not necessarily share common underlying metabolic defects. This study also indicates that FS rats do not exhibit any defect in any components of TEE and RQ before being submitted to HFD; to our knowledge this leaves for now circulating triglycerides after a high-fat preload as the only good predictor in rats of later sensitivity to HFD [53]. In contrast, we observed that in fed CS rats adapted to a HC diet, lipid oxidation is lower and glucose oxidation larger than in CR rats. This CS model appears to be a new rodent model of sensitivity to obesity that may help to explore other potential mechanisms involved in the predisposition to obesity in humans and in the dissociation sometimes observed with fat intake.']"

Phylogenetic and observational evidence suggests that other ‘dog to ferret-badger’ host-shift events have occurred, and might occur in the future. Development of effective methods for rabies control in these poorly understood species may have far-reaching public health and wildlife conservation implications for countries where ferret-badgers occur. Findings from this initial study, considering its stated limitations, suggest that baits compatible with the natural diet and consumption mechanics of small meso-carnivores should have a greater chance for success. Continued research is needed on ferret-badger ecology, habitat use, population dynamics, and movements. This information, in tandem with more comprehensive studies to identify optimal baits, attractants, and vaccines is necessary to determine if ferret-badger rabies control is achievable.']"

With OPAs, we and others have been able to detect adversity to numerous exposures (e.g., added sugar diets and pharmaceuticals) and genetic manipulations (e.g., cousin- and sibling-level inbreeding, and harboring the t-Complex) that were missed by other, often molecular, assays [20–26]. Successful examples of fitness assays, such as OPAs, illustrating cryptic phenotypes from genetic manipulations support their use in functional genomics, especially when confronted with disruptions that lead to “no-phenotype” relative to controls [46]. The illustration that HoxA1 and HoxB1 protein do not fully recapitulate each other’s phenotypes, suggests that these paralogs have diverged in gene function over time, likely through sub-functionalization.']"

Our study also identified novel genes that are potentially under direct regulation by ERα and whose role in the heart is yet unclear, and we have shown how their biological relevance can be identified through Wnt signaling. It is likely that alterations in the dietary pattern, aging, or induction of metabolic stress could reveal additional phenotypic and metabolic differences for which further studies could lead to a better understanding of cardiac biology and potentially, improved treatment in a sex-dependent manner.']"

The hormonal balance induced by the probiotics could also be playing a positive role in the improvement of the sperm motility parameters. However, considering the value of these findings, larger studies accounting for the possible variability in sperm kinematics and/or hormonal influence, further investigating the underlying mechanisms of the positive effect of probiotics on male fertility potential under obesity conditions are required to provide a more solid conclusion.']"

Importantly, this study identified the sociodemographic determinants of high pre-pregnancy BMI and excessive GWG in the local context of countries in the EMR. These findings should feed into the development of culture-specific evidence based interventions for the promotion of healthy body weight in women of childbearing age, and the prevention of excessive weight gain during pregnancy.

The health related effects seem to be slowly diminishing over time, why future focus should be on sustaining health behavior during the family-based intervention. The day camp is a feasible solution that can be applied in most organizational settings, especially in a Danish context. As no consensus has yet been reached how best to reduce overweight and obesity among children and adolescents, an immersive day-camp combined with a family focus can be one of the more effective tools in order to overcome the rising problem of childhood overweight and obesity.']"
2013-11-20T00:00:00Z,Adipose and Muscle Tissue Gene Expression of Two Genes (NCAPG and LCORL) Located in a Chromosomal Region Associated with Cattle Feed Intake and Gain,"['The populations of animals examined in this study vary according to sex, age and diet, and it is plausible that any of these factors or a combination of these factors may be crucial for gene expression of either NCAPG or LCORL in adipose and muscle. Our data indicate that for steers in a feedlot setting, LCORL in muscle is contributing to or responding to the variation in feed intake. However, the expression of LCORL related to feed intake in female animals appears to occur in the adipose tissue. And contrary to steers, the NCAPG transcript abundance within the muscle of adult female cows is associated with the ADG phenotype. These differences suggest roles for both gene products in the muscle and adipose tissues of beef cattle in ADFI and ADG phenotypes, and may provide insight into the many SNP association and GWAS studies that have found association of one or both genes with growth, feed intake, height, length, carcass weight and carcass composition phenotypes.']"

These modern methods are confirming and expanding the classical microbiological findings of Hungate and others. Our study demonstrates that the core rumen microbiome is surprisingly stable across a range of diets and during an acidotic event. Alterations in community structure that do occur during acidosis appear to quickly recover after a few days. Bacteria that emerge or undergo significant population changes could serve as indicators of subclinical or clinical acidosis. Further research to determine if there is a possibility for microbial programming or alteration of rumen microbial succession may identify the optimal time to manipulate the core microbiome in a manner that could lead to substantive improvements in ruminant productivity such as resistance to digestive upset or increased feed efficiency.']

In contrast, the lactic acid concentration during the Late stage increased significantly compared with the earlier stages, suggestive of a different underlying mechanism of SARA. Regarding the rumen bacterial composition, the unclassified Ruminococcaceae and unclassified Lachnospiraceae were the most abundant bacterial genera, while family Lachnospiraceae (OTU238) and genus Intestinimonas (OTU167) may be associated with lactic acid production and utilization, respectively, during the Late stage.

2013-09-11T00:00:00Z,Opportunistic Feeding Strategy for the Earliest Old World Hypsodont Equids: Evidence from Stable Isotope and Dental Wear Proxies,"['To better understand the Late Miocene dispersal of the earliest high-crowned hipparionines in the Old World two hypotheses were investigated: (1) hypsodont cheek teeth facilitated the exploitation of grassy abrasive vegetation in evolving open grassland landscapes and, (2) hypsodont cheek teeth enabled H. primigenium to occupy a broad dietary niche. Combined dental meso- and microwear together with enamel oxygen and carbon stable isotope analyses on four populations of hipparionines in Europe, amongst the earliest in the Old World, support mixed feeding habits for H. primigenium with a strong reliance on leafy plants rather than on grazing habits. This high-crowned equid was thus adapted to use a wide range of dietary sources and had a large dietary flexibility. Feeding changed partly on a meal-by-meal basis, but was likely also affected by local and seasonal availability of vegetational resources in the natural food supply. This dietary flexibility was likely a key factor for the rapid dispersal of H. primigenium from North America into Eurasia, given the different environmental settings in this region.With the broad feeding habits of H. primigenium, its hypsodont dentition may no longer be regarded as a constraint for forage on abrasive items in open landscapes. Instead, it would rather enable opportunistic feeding from grazing to pure browsing for long periods of time; even when no less abrasive diets were available. The hypsodonty of its cheek teeth would allow H. primigenium to survive in a variety of landscape types which did not necessarily provide the food items that would limit hypsodont herbivores to abrasive diets. Thus Hippotherium is an example of the Liem’s paradox, hypothesizing that specialized phenotypes (here hypsodonty) enable more ecological flexibility in a taxon and the occupation of a broader dietary niche.The arrival of this ecologically flexible equid must have imposed severe competition on brachydont anchitheres that occupied a variable browsing or mixed feeding niche in the Late Miocene of Europe [110]. The higher permanent dietary flexibility of H. primigenium might thus be the cause for the rapid replacement of the low-crowned equid Anchitherium aurelianense in Europe during the Late Miocene (MN9–MN10).']"
2015-10-02T00:00:00Z,Analysis of Food Pairing in Regional Cuisines of India,"['With the help of data analytical techniques we have shown that food pairing in major Indian regional cuisines follow a consistent trend. We analyzed the reason behind this characteristic pattern and found that spices, individually and as a category, play a crucial role in rendering the negative food pairing to the cuisines. The use of spices as a part of diet dates back to ancient Indus civilization of Indian subcontinent [5–7]. They also find mention in Ayurvedic texts such as Charaka Samhita and Bhaavprakash Nighantu [20–23]. Trikatu, an Ayurvedic formulation prescribed routinely for a variety of diseases, is a combination of spices viz., long pepper, black pepper and ginger [24]. Historically spices have served several purposes such as coloring and flavoring agents, preservatives and additives. They also serve as anti-oxidants, anti-inflammatory, chemopreventive, antimutagenic and detoxifying agents [23, 25]. One of the strongest hypothesis proposed to explain the use of spices is the antimicrobial hypothesis, which suggests that spices are primarily used due to their activity against food spoilage bacteria [9, 26]. A few of the most antimicrobial spices [27] are commonly used in Indian cuisines. Our recent studies have shown the beneficial role of capsaicin, an active component in cayenne which was revealed to be the most prominent ingredient in consistently rendering the negative food pairing in all regional cuisines [28]. The importance of spices in Indian regional cuisines is also highlighted by the fact that these cuisines have many derived ingredients (such as garam masala, ginger garlic paste etc.) that are spice combinations. The key role of spices in rendering characteristic food pairing in Indian cuisines and the fact that they are known to be of therapeutic potential, provide a basis for exploring possible causal connection between diet and health as well as prospection of therapeutic molecules from food ingredients. Flavor pairing has been used as a basic principle in algorithm design for both recipe recommendation and novel recipe generation, thereby enabling computational systems to enter the creative domain of cooking and suggesting recipes [17, 18]. In such algorithms, candidate recipes are generated based on existing domain knowledge and flavor pairing plays a crucial role while selecting the best among these candidates [18].']"

Anatase TiO2 NPs, i.e., E171 and NNM TiO2, significantly reduced growth rate of R. trifolii and did not display a primary particle size dependent effect because they reduced bacterial growth in the same extent and revealed similar aggregate sizes. In the hydroponic system, red clover biomass significantly decreased in all TiO2 NP treatments and NNM TiO2. Red clover plants treated with TiO2 NPs revealed reduced nitrogen (15N) content, indicating impaired nutrition and elevated stress.

Given the important roles of 25(OH)D in the body, it can be recommended that adults have their serum 25(OH)D assessed at routine physical examinations, to determine if treatment is necessary. This group of participants did not consume adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D indicating the necessity of nutrition education. Consideration should be given, when possible, to utilizing FMI to categorize adiposity and making subsequent recommendations for weight maintenance or loss. Treatment recommendations for those shown to be insufficient and deficient would include weight loss if necessary along with vitamin D2 or D3 supplementation in the amount of 6,000–10,000 IU per day [1, 8, 30]. Normalizing serum 25(OH)D through food and supplements has the potential to positively impact several parameters of an individual’s health including weight status, visceral adiposity and waist circumference, strength, and bone health.']"

Using specimens from five different pits ranging from about 37 Kybp to 13 Kybp (just before the extinction of S. fatalis), significant differences were found in both the actual thickness of cortical bone, and the standardized thickness of cortical bone at the lower P4 between pit 13, which had the lowest amount of bone, and pit 61/67 which had the highest. This supports other studies that have shown that individuals in pit 13 were under physiological and perhaps dietary stress, which may be reflected in their deposition of cortical bone, while the opposite trend is seen in the individuals in pit 61/67. This opens the door for future studies on the effects of nutritional stress in S. fatalis and other carnivores at Rancho La Brea and throughout the Pleistocene. The unique sample of juvenile S. fatalis present at Rancho La Brea would be excellent for a continuation of this work.']"

Although we are uncertain whether the regulation of these genes in neonates is beneficial, we have gained insight on how neonatal VA supplementation regulates recycling (megalin, Lrp2), trafficking (Rbp4), storage (Lrat), and oxidation of retinoids (Raldhs and Cyp26s). It has been of great interest to determine whether neonatal treatment with VA or RA has any long-term benefit, or at least no adverse effect, in those that have received supplementation at birth; therefore, we have sought to understand the possible long-term effects of neonatal oral supplementation with VARA. The results from this study may help inform the clinical treatment of VA deficiency diseases and the development of nutritional recommendations for neonates.']"

At 12°C there was little change in food quality but naupliar development was faster at high pCO2, while at 17°C phytoplankton food quality increased at moderate pCO2 but did not translate to benefits for the copepods, demonstrating that organism responses ultimately arise from a combination of both direct and nutritional effects of pCO2. This hypothesis is also supported by the decline in the ratio of copepod FA stores to ingested FA with elevated pCO2. This study shows the importance of testing food quality effects on grazers and cautions against a simple extrapolation of phytoplankton biochemistry to higher trophic levels. Carefully designed experimental systems are needed to properly separate direct effects on grazers from the influence of food quality, which has important implications for design and interpretation of many OA experiments.']"

Our results show that cows in a pasture-based system, present impaired mitochondrial function during early lactation, increased acetylation of mitochondrial proteins and decreased levels of sirtuin 3. Overall our results highlight the relevance of nutritional management in this crucial period.During early lactation, an increase in acetyl-CoA, can promote acetylation of mitochondrial proteins. Higher levels of sirtuin 3 in cows in the TMR-based system versus pasture-based system can counter the increase in acetylation and help maintain mitochondrial homeostasis. However, lower sirtuin 3 levels in cows in the pasture-based system could result in increased acetylation of mitochondrial proteins affecting respiration, oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation; potentially leading to accumulation of triglycerides in the liver.']"

Schoolchildren in the highest tertiles of physical activity and sedentary behavior scores were significantly more likely to present a Mixed DP. The “Traditional” DP was associated with the report of food consumption on weekdays (school day) as opposed to non-school days in both sexes.The development of nutritional interventions directed at groups of individuals with similar PAs seems to be a promising strategy for allowing greater specificity in actions. For example, children in “Mixed” PA could be encouraged to decrease consumption of high-fat and industrialized foods and substitute these with healthier foods such as fruits and vegetables. On the other hand, the focus of intervention for the schoolchildren in the “Traditional” pattern would be to maintain the healthy aspects of traditional Brazilian foods. In addition, in order to reduce the high prevalence of overweight observed in the present study, related health interventions must also include programs to increase physical activity levels.']"

The review found strong significant positive effect on the development of food insecurity among female HIV infected adults living in the low and middle income countries compared to female HIV infected adults living in high income countries. These findings suggest that policy makers, planners, and program managers in these settings should pay attention to gender dynamics in the design and implementation of HIV prevention and control program that address food insecurity.

As in rodents and humans [2, 61], the activation of lipolytic pathways could induce inflammatory responses and changes in AT immune cell trafficking. These alterations in inflammation patterns may be modulated in part by oxylipids generated during lipolysis [11]. Results from our study indicate that changes in the oxylipid profiles of AT and plasma are linked with lipolysis intensity. Enhanced availability of LA coincided with increased 13-HODE content in AT and plasma. At the same time, lipolysis was associated with increased AT concentrations of ArA metabolites including 15-HETE. Elucidating the effects of these ArA- and LA-derived oxylipids on AT function during the periparturient period will aid the development of nutritional interventions that can modulate the deleterious effects of excessive lipolysis on dairy cow health and lactation performance.']"

The results show differences in glycerophospholipid and glycosphingolipid metabolism, aspartate and asparagine metabolism, and purine and pyrimidine metabolism pathways in CQ-R vs CQ-S subjects prior to antimalarial treatment. Based on previous studies, low catabolism of host hemoglobin with further lower hemozoin formation in P. vivax-infected reticulocytes in CQ-resistant parasites could be involved in this sequence of metabolic alteration. Although the number of samples in this study was small, the results demonstrate the future potential of HRM in identifying P. vivax infected individuals that are likely to show CR, and thus facilitate the design of optimal treatment plans. We present differentially expressed metabolites and perturbed pathways that will require further validation in clinical human cohorts and animal studies. Components of host metabolism regulation may be involved in the PvCR phenomenon, including the effects of nutritional, metabolic and immune factors.']"

This comprehensive transcriptome analysis data can form the basis for accelerated genomics-assisted genetic improvement programs and facilitate a better understanding and more effective manipulation of biochemical pathways, including lipid biosynthesis. The data across five different seed developmental stages, with special reference to genes involved in lipid metabolism can serve as very valuable information, especially in plant lipid research focusing on improving the quality and quantity of chia seed oil and in promoting it as commercial edible oil. This knowledge can subsequently enable more focused and intensive research on this underutilized crop, leading to the development of better cultivars or lines promoting its large-scale commercial cultivation and utilization, especially in developing countries with rampant malnutrition.']"

These HDL proteomics findings help to understand the improvement of the HDL functionality by measuring the effectiveness of nutritional interventions in a similar manner to pharmacological treatments as proposed by Birner-Gruenberger [40]. In conclusion, consumption of VOO, or phenol-enriched VOOs, has an impact on the HDL proteome in a cardioprotective mode that could enhance HDL functionality by up-regulating proteins related to cholesterol homeostasis, protection against oxidation, and blood coagulation while down-regulating proteins involved in acute-phase response, lipid transport, and immune response. The common protein expression modifications reported after the three VOOs indicate an important effect of the fatty acid and PC composition present in the common matrix of these VOO on the HDL remodeling. Further studies are needed, however, in order to assess the specific effects of each VOO incorporating different phenolic contents.']"

In the process of P. medicaginis colonization of the alfalfa leaves, glycolysis, TCA cycle and β-oxidation metabolism pathways in the infected leaves accumulated strongly at later infection stages, which may provide ATP, a N source and nutrition for P. medicaginis to colonize alfalfa leaves. Moreover very strong induction of the TCA cycle pathways by the pathogen at later infection stage may induce senescence in alfalfa leaves, leading to plant death. Intermediates metabolites of these metabolic pathways, and inositol phosphate, glutathione, some amino acids metabolic pathways, such as glycine, leucine, isoleucine, tyrosine and lysine, accumulated rapidly and strongly at an early infection stage may enhance the ability of alfalfa to resist necrotrophic P. medicaginis. The tentatively identified differential metabolites and related pathways may serve as potential markers for developing novel disease-control strategies and breeding resistant varieties.']"
2015-10-01T00:00:00Z,Examining the Impact of a Public Health Message on Fish Consumption in Bermuda,"['This study provides evidence that public health messages by the Government of Bermuda, which advocated that pregnant women consume fewer large fish, may be effective. The majority of women who consume fish report that they eat less large fish species, such as swordfish. Consumption of small fish species with highly beneficial nutrient profiles is reportedly low in this population. Some women reported lowering their consumption of these species during pregnancy, and if these are the only fish they eat, messaging could be unduly adverse to the nutrition of these women. Public health messages may need clarification so that women understand that it is acceptable to continue, even increase, their consumption of smaller fish species during pregnancy. Given the importance of maritime culture to Bermuda, health promotion activities centered on fish or fishing, such as cooking demonstrations with anchovies and sardines, or community-based programs that subsidize or give-away smaller fish species to pregnant women, may be promising avenues of intervention in the future.']"

Although, we used just one organo-chlorine pesticide at a nonlethal level, the severity of implications to health of concurrent exposure to a cocktail of low dose pesticides and biotic/abiotic stressors may be far greater, as can be correlated with the noticeable enormous fish biodiversity loss worldwide. We found synergistic effects of exposures to very low concentrations of a pesticide and pathogen infection, leading to further decreased immunocompetence and enhanced mortality in fish with already compromised stress responses, which can be counteracted with dietary lipotropic compounds that enhance immunity and the detoxification efficiency of the liver. This physiological basis indicates that nonlethal pesticide toxicities, along with induced nutritional deficiency stress, may be a driver for aquatic species decline or extinction, and appropriate strategies like dietary lipotropes may be used for resurrecting the endangered and declining aquatic species.']"

Furthermore, these changes express a dual burden in this population. On one side we see a reduction in malnourished youth; on the other, a rise in the prevalence of overweight and obesity probably linked to the rapid urbanization process and lifestyle modifications. Public education policies and intervention programs must be established and implemented to stop the increase in overweight and obesity, which may reduce the risk of chronic diseases development in later life. Further, great care must be taken to reduce, or better eradicate the problem of under-nutrition in youth. Since urbanization sprawl and organization, food intake, levels of physical activity, and time spent in sedentary activities may also be associated with the present findings, future studies should be conducted to identify their impact on the growth and health of children and adolescents.']"

2014-09-09T00:00:00Z,Characterization of a Soluble Phosphatidic Acid Phosphatase in Bitter Melon (Momordica charantia),"['Phosphatidic acid phosphatases (PAPs) catalyze the dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol, the penultimate step in TAG synthesis. PAPs are widely present in plants, animals, microbes and human. PAPs are typically categorized into two subfamilies: Mg2+-dependent soluble PAP and Mg2+-independent membrane-associated PAP. In this study, we provided evidence for the existence of a new class of PAP enzyme in bitter melon (Momordica charantia). This class of PAP is soluble and Mg2+-independent. PAP protein is probably associated with other proteins in the oilseeds. Bitter melon has been used as herbal medicine for a long time. The molecular basis of these uses is supported by recent studies showing the potential of bitter melon oil being used in a wide range of nutritional and medicinal applications. Therefore, understanding and regulating PAP activities may lead to increased yield of bitter melon oil. The elucidation of PAP functions may lead to novel approaches to modulate cellular lipid storage and metabolic diseases.']"

Seeping fluids recovered by trapping in the GATS markers had distinct chemical compositions from the ambient seawater. Particularly, high pH of the accumulated GATS fluid is the first direct evidence for on-going seepage of serpentinization-associated geofluid in this area. The highly alkaline fluids rich in hydrogen sulfide and methane can serve as an energy and nutrient sources to sustain chemosynthetic productions and associated animal communities. Carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur isotope systematics of various components in the SSF suggest that most of the animals living there rely on chemosynthetic production. On the other hand, some animals use not only chemosynthetic products but also photosynthetic products. It means that sinking particles from the euphotic zone are also important nutritional sources for animals inhabiting the SSF, despite being at a depth of ~5,700 m.']"

In addition, the lack of GP in astrocyte-like glia suggests that the cellular localization of the glycogen breakdown might differ from vertebrate astrocytes. We anticipate that GS and GP both provide useful markers for future studies that attempt a more refined functional classification of glial populations in honey bees and other insects. Such reappraisal of previous glial cell classification systems already suggested different subtypes of astrocyte-like glia, for example, and the annotation of additional glial cell classes [15]. Concerning aging, using glial-specific markers in the honey bee now allows to study in more detail the associations of a protein with age protective characteristics (vitellogenin) and glial cells, which we have previously reported [83].We hope our findings can inspire future studies in the honey bee model to better understand the role of neuron-glia interaction in memory formation, aging, and nutritional physiology.']"

Given the epidemiological profile of the Latin-American region, with non-communicable diseases and obesity as the leading causes of death and morbidity, urgent actions are required to address this public health problems. Other more directive or semi-directive labeling formats, such as the Warning labels or the Multiple Traffic Light, could be more effective in helping the most vulnerable consumers make healthier food choices, particularly decreasing consumption of critical ingredients. Future studies should explore the effect of these labels on the actual purchasing behavior of Latin-American consumers [55], as well as the need of parallel mass-communication campaigns to improve label understanding and incentivize consumers to improve their food choices.']"

Circadian clock genes in the brain in response to photoperiod alterations, possibly through npas2/bmal1 stimulation (Fig 6), may play a role in the signalling cascade involved in triggering puberty. LL appears to affect gnrh1, kiss2 and estrogen signalling (via esr1), while AP appears to affect gnrh2, gnrh1 and kiss1rb (Fig 6). Gene promoter analysis predicted nutritional/metabolism related genes within the reproduction related gene network, and one such gene, galr1b, was highly responsive to photoperiod treatments (Fig 6). Regardless of the photoperiod regime, gnrh1 was markedly affected by LL and AP suggesting a central role in the integration/translation of light stimuli to the reproduction-related gene network associated with pubertal onset.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0144158.g006\nFig 6\n\nDiagram summarizing the results obtained in this study.\nThe key genes involved in gonadotropin stimulation and activation of the BPG axis are highly responsive soon after photoperiodic shift and prior to pubertal activation.

2014-08-25T00:00:00Z,The Immune System in Children with Malnutrition—A Systematic Review,"['In spite of the prevalence of malnutrition, and its fatal consequences, scientific interest in the immune deficiency of malnutrition seems dwindling, and little research has been carried out on the topic during the last ten years. For this reason, most evidence on the subject relies on immunological methods used 30 to 40 years ago, many of which are no longer in use, and little research has been done with modern methods, and with the present understanding of immunology. Moreover, most studies have looked at isolated aspects of immune function, despite the fact that the parameters are interdependent, and the division into innate and adaptive immune function seems to be a simplification. Thus, our understanding of immune function in malnutrition is still very limited.This review illuminates the little that we know about the immunological alterations associated with malnutrition, and also points to significant gaps in our knowledge. Future well designed prospective cohort studies should examine how immune parameters are related to morbidity and mortality in malnourished children, with detailed characteristic of nutritional status, preferably body composition, of infections, enteropathy and of low-grade inflammation. When testing nutritional and medical interventions for malnutrition, immune parameters should be included as outcomes. Studies should investigate newer immunological parameters in malnutrition, like expression of innate pattern recognition receptors (as the Toll-like receptor), the lectin pathway of the complement system and mTOR expression and activity. It should be investigated whether a small thymus is associated with lower output of recent thymic-derived T-cells, and how it correlates with hormones like leptin, cortisol, insulin and Insulin Growth Factor-1. Innate and adaptive immune parameters should be assessed simultaneously, taking into account their dynamic interdependency. To understand whether malnutrition is indeed associated with active down-regulation of immune reactivity (as formulated in the “tolerance hypothesis”), the balance between regulatory T-lymphocytes and their counterparts, Th17 lymphocytes should be measured. Finally, prospective studies among children at risk should assess whether immune profiles differ in those who subsequently develop oedematous and non-oedematous malnutrition, and it should be investigated whether children with oedematous malnutrition have markers suggestive of auto-immune or inflammatory diseases. Such studies would reduce our current ignorance on the interplay between malnutrition and infectious diseases.']"

These changes may result, at least partially, from increases in the cytokines TNF-α and IL-8, but not in TGF-β and IL-10 and from Cu-induced oxidative stress. We also demonstrated that changes in cytokines and antioxidant enzymes might be correlated to the signalling molecules NF-κB, IκB, Nrf2 and Keap1 (Fig 11).

Some taxa that were identified macroscopically were not found with the DNA. It may be that such taxa were misidentified via macroscopic methods, however even some of the easily identified taxa were not identified via DNA. Nonetheless, DNA did prove to be more sensitive and taxonomically more resolute as it identified more taxa than the macroscopic methods. Moreover it showed a positive relationship to the amount of biomass identified macroscopically, suggesting that the number of DNA sequences obtained may be used as an indicator for how much biomass was consumed. DNA metabarcoding can be a powerful new method to study the diets of animals, yet we suggest that more studies be done to investigate the comparability of past and present methods using both experimental and comparative approaches.']"
2016-09-19T00:00:00Z,A Systematic Literature Review and Meta-Regression Analysis on Early-Life Energy Restriction and Cancer Risk in Humans,"['In general, it seems that severe transient ER in the absence of a nutritious diet is associated with increased cancer risk in the breast (for ER exposure at adolescent age) and prostate. Evidence for associations between severe transient ER early in life and risk at other cancer sites is limited. In the meta-analysis of the prospective cohort studies, the duration, rather than severity of exposure to early-life ER, seems to positively influence relative risk estimates. Results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of studies and difficulty in disentangling duration, severity and geographical setting of the exposure. For exposure to less severe ER, a decreased association with cancer risk is generally observed, although this is derived only from ecological studies. This raises the question on how to proceed in this field. Molecular epidemiological approaches within existing studies may contribute to explain in part the variation in disease risk across sites providing better insight into the mechanisms that might be at play.']"

This analysis has useful lessons on how pricing and promotion can be used to promote healthy dietary behaviour changes in public places. Firstly, the price rises in leisure centres were effective in reducing purchases of high sugar beverages. Secondly, visual and verbal promotions of the policy at retail points and by staff are likely to have enhanced the effectiveness of the policy when the results are compared with other policy evaluations. Thirdly, the price elasticity of demand is highly variable across products, with the greatest reductions in child-friendly products, suggesting that parent’s purchases of food and drink for children may be particularly susceptible to these campaigns. Fourthly, the evaluation identified a large increase in sales of artificially sweetened beverages, suggesting customers are willing to substitute with diet products.']"

Additionally, such tools are not always applicable to rare or orphan diseases. Abnormal metabotypes can sometimes be detected in an untargeted fashion by visual comparison of the data. However, detection of subtle abnormalities and abnormal patterns is extremely subjective and time-consuming. An alternative approach, SHM, was proposed in this study.In SHM, the metabotype of an individual is compared to normal (healthy) metabotypes in a multivariate manner. Any abnormal patterns are indicated by the method. Subsequently, this information can be used for diagnosis.

The massive skull trauma indicates massive central blunt force that must have been acquired perimortally. The young age of approximately 20 to 25 years further supports the speculation that the individual suffered from ritual homicide – as previously seen repeatedly in South America. Finally, the individual suffered from Chagas disease – the result of chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection – that obviously has been acquired in early infancy.

However the causality between these two variables remains unknown. Thus there is a great need to study causality using feasible methods. As suggested by Jacka et al. [16], studies that test the effectiveness of dietary modification (promotion of healthy eating at the expense of unhealthy eating) as a means of preventing mental ill-health are required to further explore this association and provide a better understanding of the causal relationships between these variables. Public health strategies that use mental health promotion as a preventative mechanism for depressive symptoms in such a way have the potential to be less expensive and have a greater reach, especially in LMICs, than more traditional psychological interventions such as pharmaceuticals and clinical sessions once depression has already occurred. In addition, this form of intervention would also have a broader impact at a population level as compared to traditional options.']"

While previous research has shown that healthy food environments are associated with healthy diets, this is the first study to explore the relationship between the local food environment and organic food consumption. While it remains unclear whether or not there is a health benefit to eating organic food, there is growing evidence that consumption of organic food can reduce pesticide exposure and that, at least for some segments of the population, even low levels of pesticide exposure may have health effects. There are also other reasons that people may choose to eat organic food, including concerns for farmworker safety and ecological health. Allowing everyone equal ability to make this choice may present yet another argument for leveling the playing field of food accessibility.']"

Northern, and particularly the northwestern, Chinese populations may have a higher prevalence of CD than southern populations because of their genetic background. The northern groups have an HLA-related background, with apparent gene flows from Caucasian origin, and a diet that includes wheat as the staple food. Based on the rapidly changing dietary patterns in modern China, with increasing amounts of wheat and gluten being consumed, a sharp rise in the prevalence of CD can be expected nationwide. This may well justify mass population screening for genetic markers that predispose to CD, as well as coordinated measures from the government, medical and agricultural research institutions, and the food industries. Awareness of the health and societal impact of CD should be raised and they should be developing prevention strategies to guarantee the health and quality of life of Chinese individuals suffering from silent or active celiac disease.']"

Upon reaching the posterior stomach and the upper and middle portions of the midgut, both pathogens can establish, proliferate, and cause tissue damage, particularly to the epithelial layers. No tissue damage, however, was seen in the posterior midgut or in the hindgut. Infection via the oral route represents a more natural way of infection rather than by the injection of bacteria into shrimp. The findings from this study will enable further research to decipher the bacterial pathogen-host interactions that contribute to disease, leading to new methods to prevent or combat infection, for instance, through inhibition of bacterial attachment, quorum sensing and / or biofilm formation.']"

Furthermore, feathers could be used by the poultry industry as a non-invasive sampling matrix suitable for monitoring different veterinary medications. The depletion behavior we have detailed in this work leads us to believe that this matrix could become an effective tool for the inspection of diets destined to feed different animal species and, therefore, aid on the design and application of new policies of antimicrobial surveillance.']"

However, some metabolic differences should be observed for its use. The model associated with the cafeteria-style diet (DE) generates greater alterations in the lipid profile, and changes related to neuropathies and retinopathies, being also more susceptible to the benefits of FR. On the other hand, the model without dietary intervention (DN) was more vulnerable to oxidative damage and showed signs of nephropathy, with less benefit of FR. The oxidative stress was increased in both models of type 2 diabetes, but it was more pronounced in the DNC diabetic rats. Food restriction reduced the protein carbonyls in the plasma of both DER and DNR diabetic groups, but the antioxidant capacity was improved only in the plasma of DER group. FR has great potential to improve diabetes-related parameters, although it is not able to reverse the conditions of our models in isolation. Therefore, FR should be associated with other treatments.']"

And, it has tended to be seen as an amorphous package. Program performance has been tracked in terms of contacts, with the ANC4+ indicator being the main performance measure used. Often this has been operationalized specifying that the contact needs to be with a “skilled birth attendant”, i.e. a health worker with the full set of midwifery competencies (excluding services given by other categories of health worker or health auxiliary). But the content of care has not received equal attention from the maternal-newborn community. Instead, it is other programs (malaria, nutrition, immunization, HIV, etc.) that have given attention to particular interventions provided during pregnancy. Such neglect of content represents an important missed opportunity to achieve better population maternal-newborn outcomes. Optimal strategy for delivering such content will depend on context. But with more serious attention to ensuring provision of an appropriate set of interventions at high coverage, particularly among disadvantaged populations, substantially reduced mortality is achievable.']"

LBW fetuses exhibit decreased amounts of crude fat and several FAs (including C14:0, C16:1, C17:0, and C18:2n6c) during mid-gestation and late-gestation, which may in turn affect the adaptability, growth, and development of the fetus. These findings may provide a theoretical basis for developing nutritional interventions that target fetuses with low birth weight in animals. Additional studies are needed to demonstrate the underlying mechanisms through which these effects occur during gestation.']"
2016-11-30T00:00:00Z,"Antimicrobial Potential, Identification and Phylogenetic Affiliation of Wild Mushrooms from Two Sub-Tropical Semi-Evergreen Indian Forest Ecosystems","['The macrofungal diversity from two protected forest areas in India was undertaken and their antimicrobial potential was investigated. For the first time 231 wild macrofungi were collected and documented from the selected locations. The significant antifungal and antibacterial activity was found in Microporus sp. and Schizophyllum commune respectively. Further testing of these strains for the discovery of novel and efficient antimicrobials should be considered. Microporus sp. strain BPSM 33 showed the highest antagonistic potential against the phytopathogen F. oxysporum with 85.71% of inhibition and could be used for the development of biocontrol agent against F. oxysporum. Furthermore, the genetic variation among the potential strains showing antimicrobial potential was considered by using RAPD and ISSR molecular markers. We reported that the selected markers can be used for assessing genetic diversity of wild mushrooms, considering both marker systems gave similar results in the present study. We also conclude that the wild edible mushroom strains does not have only nutritional values but also can be used as an accessible source of natural antioxidants.']"

We have provided a global transcriptome study of T. brucei during its travel through the insect vector by monitoring transcript abundance in trypanosomes isolated from three distinct tissues, i.e. the midgut, proventriculus and the salivary gland. In addition, this approach has very recently been extended to highlight the host-parasite interactions in the tsetse salivary glands [39]. Although we recognize that the salivary gland trypanosome transcriptome is rather complex and impossible to tease apart, since it contains data from proliferating epimastigotes as well as cell-cycle arrested and transmission competent metacyclics, the presented RNA-Seq datasets constitute the first resource of its kind that will facilitate further interrogation of “heart of darkness” T. brucei life-cycle stages in the tsetse vector.']"

Organic fertilizer also resulted in an increase of soil organic matter. Moreover, organic fertilization positively affected the carbohydrate content. Plant fed with animal-based fertilizer, due to intrinsic composition, displayed a better biomass development and mineral nutrition.The presented data support the idea that liquid organic fertilizers can be successfully used as a substitute of mineral fertilizers in citrus trees nutrient management under drip irrigation, since they enhance soil chemical fertility, prevent excessive nitrate-N concentration, promote plant growth and C fixation in the plant. Moreover, these fertilizers would allow not only to reduce the use of chemicals, but also to re-use crop residues and animal manure, conferring them an added value. Nevertheless, further studies should be addressed in order to evaluate these results in field conditions.']"

The method effectively enabled participants to identify several systemic barriers in their community which they believed required action, in particular, the proliferation of fast-food outlets and unhealthy food marketing. However, the shift from considering barriers to proposing actions in the system, whereby participants envisage ways to modify the underlying norms and goals of the system, takes considerable time and trained SD practitioners. Future researchers wishing to use GMB could use the template provided in this research to structure their GMB sessions, but would be advised to allocate an additional step to co-design potential actions in detail with participants and specify how the action will influence the system as represented in the CLD. This research has identified several potential actions now ready for further development and testing in the local community. GMB has proved a useful method to explore community views on a complex issue and catalyse action to improve public health nutrition.']"

While the degree of glucose control and optimal caloric supplementation remain unclear, it is generally accepted that hyperglycemia foreshadows poor outcome in critical illness, and recent evidence suggests that early caloric supplementation may worsen outcome [8]. The mechanisms underlying the development of hyperglycemia in sepsis remain poorly defined, and the protective role of endogenous insulin production versus the detrimental role of glucose toxicity continues to be controversial. Our data suggest that a mechanism exists whereby glucose supplementation early in the evolution of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome combines to drive the development of peripheral insulin resistance and suppresses pancreatic insulin production thereby amplifying metabolic decompensation and worsening the degree of hyperglycemia and potentially outcome. Additional investigation is required to explore the mechanism by which circulating glucose and systemic inflammation interact to alter glucose disposal and the pancreatic beta cell response to hyperglycemia in the setting of sepsis.']"

Long term and adjuvant dietary EPA and DHA feeding were equally efficacious in markedly improving the therapeutic index of CPT-11/5-FU chemotherapy by concurrently enhancing drug efficacy to the tumor while reducing the toxicity effect of fat accumulation within skeletal muscle. Our study highlights the therapeutic potential of EPA and DHA as promising nutritional adjuvants to chemotherapy, which is of particular importance given the prognostic value of myosteatosis as an independent predictive factor of short- and long-term outcomes in cancer. Findings from the present study are novel and encouraging, warranting future research to further delineate mechanisms by which dietary EPA and DHA supplementation attenuate pathological fat accumulation in the skeletal muscles of cancer patients.']"

This study indicated that, whereas underweightness persists as a significant problem, the burden of overweightness is also increasing rapidly, underscoring the importance of future research to determine the driving forces behind the increasing rates of overweightness. This study makes an important contribution by documenting the fact that the epidemics of under- and overweightness are not present within the same community. This study adds to the literature by showing that the influence of contextual environment (i.e., community wealth status) is important with regard to the nutritional well-being of women, and, in developing policies regarding the persistent and chronic problem of underweightness and the emerging problem of overweightness among women in Bangladesh, we need to consider this contextual environment. Since Bangladesh is striving towards meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2.2 plan of ending all forms of malnutrition by 2030, an integrated/holistic approach is needed to address both the under- and overnutrition among these populations.']"

In this study, we generated mRNA sequence data from the fast muscles of Chinese perch by using Solexa/Illumina RNA-seq. Twenty-one amino acid transporter genes were annotated by searching protein and gene ontology databases, and postprandial changes in their transcript abundance were assayed following a single satiating meal in juvenile of Chinese perch. Our results reveal that upon the satiating treatment, five transporter transcripts were markedly up-regulated within 1 h of refeeding, indicating that they may be promising candidate genes involved in a rapid-response signaling system that regulates fish myotomal muscle growth. These genes display coordinated regulation in favoring the resumption of myogenesis as an early response to feeding. Therefore, the present findings provide a crucial foundation for a more comprehensive understanding of the physiological function of amino acid transporters and their nutritional regulation, which may also provide practical applications in aquaculture.']"

If one takes into account that approximately 1,000,000 pregnancies per year are complicated by malaria and HIV co-infection [18], and that the rate of TB/HIV co-infection is approximately 30% [18], there is the potential for 300,000 pregnancies per year complicated by triple infection. Maternal nutritional status, another predictor of adverse pregnancy outcomes, is compounded by AIDS and a low BMI, which is shown by our data to be associated with mortality risk. In both cohorts evaluated in the present study, provision of triple ART in pregnancy was associated with a significant survival benefit which rendered maternal mortality in HIV+ women equivalent or lower to population country-wide statistics (1%) and significantly lower than the mortality of untreated HIV+ mothers. In conclusion, our data supports the need for universal access to antiretrovirals during pregnancy, as antiretrovirals prevent mortality, mothers included.']"

By analyzing model simulations and comparing them with experimental data, we have provided a conceptual framework linking the nutritional status to toxin production in this alga. In particular, we have identified four physiological processes directly associated with an increasing state of intra-cellular nutrient stress (increase of C:P and C:N cellular ratio): i) a sharp decrease in chlorophyll synthesis ii) an enhancement of toxin production, iii) the release (exudation) of toxin in the environment and iv) a reduction in metabolic maintenance leading to the formation of resting stages.By comparing model simulations with literature data, we have highlighted that our model has the potential to simulate the stoichiometric regulation of C-rich toxins in different marine dinoflagellates. The next step will be to implement the presented formulation in a comprehensive ecosystem modeling framework (for example the ERSEM-GOTM system [21]) and to use it to investigate and predict the effect of nutrient supply in the formation and evolution of harmful algal blooms.']"

Depending on the protease down-regulated, we noticed difficulties with nematode progeny hatching by knocking down Mi-ser-1 and disturbance to infect a new host plant when knocking down Mi-cpl-1. Although animal proteases are known to be important for protein digestion mainly for feeding and nutrition, they can play different roles in a many biological processes. Based on the data presented here we can conclude that at least two of the three proteases studied are possibly implicated in nematode reproduction, embryogenesis and offspring virulence. They are therefore attractive targets to engineer plants able to deliver nematode proteases dsRNA during infection. The cell specific knock-down of such proteases using promoters with strong preference for feeding cells, and also pyramiding with other nematode essential genes, could therefore be an attractive strategy to generate new tools for phytonematode control.

2015-07-29T00:00:00Z,The thiG Gene Is Required for Full Virulence of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae by Preventing Cell Aggregation,"['The findings in this study demonstrated that the thiG gene, which is involved in the thiazole moiety production in thiamine biosynthesis pathway, is required for the full virulence of Xoo on rice. The knockout of thiG in Xoo caused a decrease in growth rate in limited nutrition medium, but not in the host. Meanwhile, the formation of cell-cell aggregates like biofilm formation, swarming motility and bacterial migration in rice were influenced in the thiG mutant. These results suggest that the loss of virulence maybe caused by a reduction in the infection progression in rice. Moreover, the deletion of thiG suppressed the expression level of the rpfC and rpfG, which might indirectly induce abnormal regulation of thiamine biosynthesis in the thiG mutant. Xanthan production was not changed in the mutant but the expression of some gum genes were up-regulated, but how the absence of thiG affects the regulation of gum gene expression needs further study. These results provide new insight about role of the thiG gene in Xoo virulence and serve as an example for future research to investigate alternative functions of genes in vitamin biosynthesis pathways.']"

We also have shown that the magnitude of the inequities differed significantly according to environment (higher in urban or more developed areas) and socio-economic factors (lower for higher levels of education and professional activity) and discussed that these variations were much likely linked to socio-cultural issues related to women’s social role. Prevention wise, as well as reducing the global level of obesity, nutrition interventions or policies should then also pay specific attention to reduce that obesity gender gap which fuels gender inequities in health: - in the short term by public health interventions targeted at women (as a group specially at risk of obesity in this context) - in the more long term by policies aiming at reducing disparities (including socio-economic disparities) between genders in this context [68], [69], [70].']"

The expression of three types of opsin genes varied according to time of day and environmental conditions and was regulated by a circadian clock, light conditions and nutritional status. Ha-UV and Ha-BL were more abundant during the day than at night, which aided recognition of short-wavelength light during the day. However, Ha-LW levels decreased during the day and increased at night, which might be useful in a dim-light environment. Ha-LW levels were up-regulated in males, which might aid in locating potential sex partners and improving mating success over relatively short distances. Interestingly, daily changes in opsin mRNA levels in H. armigera did not differ much from those in diurnal insects, suggesting that opsin genes in H. armigera might play an important role in color vision, especially color perception and discrimination.']"
2014-08-20T00:00:00Z,Comparison of Glucose and Lipid Metabolic Gene Expressions between Fat and Lean Lines of Rainbow Trout after a Glucose Load,"['The present study mainly reveals the differences in the transcriptional regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism after a GTT between two genotypes of rainbow trout. In both lines, intraperitoneal administration of glucose led to a prolonged hyperglycemia, this relative inability to utilize high levels of glucose was associated with a lack of regulation of gluconeogenesis. However, compared to L line, regulation of glycemia was more stable in F line, linked to higher muscle glycogen content and an enhanced expression of glycolytic gene markers in the liver, after glucose treatment. Some of these observations are coherent with the findings of previous nutritional challenge studies [16], [32], [33] and support our hypothesis that the F line has a higher capability to maintain glucose homeostasis after a glucose load than the L line. Our data are also helpful for understanding glucose use in carnivorous fish. Therefore, genetic selection is apparently a possible way to modify the poor capability of glucose hemostasis in carnivorous fish, primarily by influencing the regulation of key enzymes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism.']"
2018-06-27T00:00:00Z,Timing of complementary feeding and associations with maternal and infant characteristics: A Norwegian cross-sectional study,"[""The majority of Norwegian infants are fed in accordance with national infant feeding recommendations. Predictors for early introduction to complementary food were breastfeeding status and maternal sociodemographic factors. Introduction of solid food before five months of age was associated with increased infant weight gain. Timing of introduction to complementary food was not, except for the infant's gender, associated with infant cues that may be markers of increased nutritional needs of the infant. Our results confirm that infants of younger, less educated and smoking mothers are still at higher risk of not being fed in compliance with the official infant feeding recommendations. Altogether, our findings emphasize the importance of targeting socioeconomically disadvantaged mothers for support on healthy feeding practices focusing on the infant's needs to prevent early onset of social inequalities in health with potential life-long duration. Larger population-based studies with a longitudinal design are needed to further explore the relationship between timing of complementary feeding, maternal socioeconomic status and infant growth trajectories.""]"

As a result, the identified intensity thresholds were higher and presented higher specificity when compared to thresholds currently recommended. The use of the proposed thresholds in this study aims to improve the quality of physical activity measure, minimizing errors in the evaluation of physical activity intensities. Moreover, these parameters presented relatively high accuracy, including when specifically applied to groups of sex, age, nutritional status and physical fitness. Therefore, the overall thresholds, as well as those related specifically to men and women, might be an important alternative to minimize physical activity intensity misclassification. The results presented in this study contribute towards more accurate physical activity measure and highlight the relevance of a better understanding regarding the impact of physical activity intensity thresholds in health outcomes.']"
2005-01-25T00:00:00Z,Educating the Brain to Avoid Dementia: Can Mental Exercise Prevent Alzheimer Disease?,"['So far, we have little evidence that mental practice will help prevent the development of dementia. We have better evidence that good brain health is multiply determined, that brain development early in life matters, and that genetic influences are of great importance in accounting for individual differences in cognitive reserve and in explaining who develops Alzheimer disease and who does not. At least half of the explanation for individual differences in susceptibility to Alzheimer disease is genetic, although the genes involved have not yet been completely discovered [15]. The balance of the explanation lies in environmental influences and behavioral health practices, alone or in interaction with genetic factors.For older adults, health practices that could influence the brain include sound nutrition, sufficient sleep, stress management, treatment of mood or anxiety disorders, good vascular health, physical exercise, and avoidance of head trauma. But there is no convincing evidence that memory practice and other cognitively stimulating activities are sufficient to prevent Alzheimer disease; it is not just a case of “use it or lose it.”']"
2013-04-02T00:00:00Z,Patterns of Detection and Capture Are Associated with Cohabiting Predators and Prey,"['Patterns of detection at cameras of devils and feral cats are consistent with the interpretation of a dominant predator – mesopredator relationship, and warrant further investigation given that devils have declined dramatically as a result of devil facial tumour disease. Because small mammals constitute a higher proportion of the diet of feral cats compared with devils, there may be an increased risk to populations of small mammals if there is an increase in the activity and thus impact of feral cats resulting from devil decline. Feral cat impacts may be exacerbated further if swamp rats truly exhibit weak avoidance of predator scents. Further investigation could focus profitably on the responses of other small Tasmanian mammals to cat cues and cat predation, especially scarce endemic species that could be at particularly increased risk. More generally, we suggest that population estimates derived from devices such as remote cameras should acknowledge the potential for one species to change the detectability of another, and ensure that this potential bias is incorporated in assessments of numbers and survival.']"

The human skeleton examined was estimated to have been that of a female of 155 ± 5 cm height who died in her late 30s. The fragmentary skull was successfully reassembled by reconstructing the damaged or missing portions utilizing computerized 3D modeling software According to a cephalometric analysis, the cephalic index (CI) of the individual was 73.5, which suggests the dolichocephalic trait (long-headedness). This, as compared with similar demographic groups of the era, is unusual. Further, the face of the individual was obtained by craniofacial reconstruction (CFR) technique employing the reconstructed skull and the above-noted computerized 3D modeling. A stable isotope analysis demonstrated that the Silla individual had consumed a more C3 (rather than C4)-based diet, which, in this particular case, probably was vegetarian. An additional mtDNA analysis showed that the Silla individual’s maternal lineage was that of the haplogroup F1b1a typical of East Asia.']"

Metaseiulus occidentalis has fewer members of the GST, CYP and CCE superfamilies than the spider mite T. urticae. This difference likely reflects a reduced need for detoxification in M. occidentalis, possibly due to the fact that this obligatory predator is likely exposed to a narrower range of potentially toxic xenobiotics in their prey diet than the plant-feeding spider mite. Clearly, further studies are needed to determine the diverse functions encoded by these genes that our current analyses have inferred. For example, to delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying pesticide resistance, further characterization and comparisons of the expression levels (or in the case of AChEs, amino acid sequences) of these genes in resistant and susceptible strains of M. occidentalis are required. Results from these future studies, coupled with functional genomic analyses using approaches such as RNAi [102–105], could tease out the molecular mechanisms for pesticide resistances in M. occidentalis.']"

We are currently applying this method in a high-throughput fashion to numerous samples of milk from both breeds to study the impact of lactation cycle, diet regimes and genetic background. The method could also be incorporated into breeding programs to select cows displaying desirable protein variants and content for specific products e.g. cheese manufacturing or evaporated powdered milk purposes.

For the first time, this investigation reported that intact NPs produced different impact on the expression of proteins involved in specific pathways compared to that by Zn2+. Because of the small size and broad applications, ZnO NPs might enter into our body and pose adverse effects on the female reproductive systems through regulation of specific signaling pathways. Actually, in our anther study, NPs were detected in hens’ ovaries when the hens were exposed to low concentration of ZnO nanoparticles in their diet. This raises the health concern that ZnO NPs may produce adverse effect on female reproductive systems. Further studies on how ZnO NPs specifically regulate genes and proteins need to be explored.']"

For the rural children, a lower DDS was found in the post-harvest season, while no difference was observed for the ASF intake, with respect to the lean season. At the light of these results, we believe that the promotion of dietary diversification strategies to improve children’s food consumption is needed in the study area. Interventions should target girls and households headed by male adults of older ages in the rural areas, and female headed households with low education level in the urban ones. We expect that findings documented by this study would assist policy makers plan and undertake regional initiatives.']"

This provides new information on the foraging ecology of Florida Pompano, with both ecological and economic implications. No previous studies have addressed group-feeding behaviors of Florida Pompano foraging on the main contributor to their natural diet. Ultimately, schooling may facilitate juvenile Florida Pompano feeding activities along the sandy beach habitat, an area where presumably (1) feeding is difficult because of the dynamic environment and (2) little protection is available from predators. Furthermore, our results are applicable to Florida Pompano aquaculture. Because foraging (and hence growth) is facilitated by groups, Florida Pompano should be reared with conspecifics, preferably of similar size to potentially reduce the dominance effect we observed. Periodically size-separating fish during the rearing period could lead to more efficient growth and harvest of Florida Pompano.']"

Gobiraptor is primarily distinguished from other oviraptorids by its dentary with the extremely thickened rostrodorsal end of the mandibular symphysis, lingual ridges and lingual shelves bearing occlusal foramina. The unique morphology of the mandible of Gobiraptor is probably closely related to a crushing-related feeding style and a specialized diet, which may have incorporated hard seeds or shelled organisms. Although Gobiraptor was recovered from the Nemegt Formation, its phylogenetic position showed a close relationship with three Ganzhou oviraptorids. The distant relationships among the Nemegt oviraptorids on the phylogenetic tree were reaffirmed in this study. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the evolution of these unusually diverse animals was facilitated by a simple sympatric speciation. The presence of Gobiraptor in the Nemegt Formation, together with occurrences of other oviraptorids, also indicates that abundant oviraptorids lived in mesic environments and they were one of the most diverse and successful groups of dinosaurs in the Nemegt region.']"

Anaemia is a severe public health problem among children ≤5 years of age in this area hence, control measures to curb the burden should focus on children ≤2 years of age, those from single parents and those whose parent had no formal education. Iron fortified diets should be given to infants who are given complementary feeding before the first months of life in order to reduce the prevalence of anaemia within the first six months of age. The study had as limitations some unmeasured factors such as micro-nutrient deficiency, and markers of inflammation which may have acted as confounders on the risk of the presence of anaemia. Never the less, the findings of the study demonstrated the invaluable contribution of infant feeding habits to these public health problems in children ≤5 years of age.']"
2017-05-31T00:00:00Z,Effects of flood irrigation on the risk of selected zoonotic pathogens in an arid and semi-arid area in the eastern Kenya,"['The ecological analyses conducted demonstrate substantial trade-offs in ecosystem services as areas that have been put under irrigation have had extensive habitat degradation leading to remarkable losses of land cover and host diversity to the benefit of increases in food production. These areas have also had more water as demonstrated by high suitability for colonization by a broad range of mosquitoes.The epidemiological studies conducted indicate that these land use/land cover changes affect the distribution of the zoonotic diseases studied. As expected, the seroprevalence of mosquito-borne diseases were higher in the irrigated and riverine areas while the risk of Leptospira spp. and Brucella spp. were higher in the pastoral areas given that peoples’ livelihoods required them to use common environments with livestock and wildlife. The pastoralists also relied on milk and meat from livestock, hence there were more opportunities for exposure to Brucella spp compared to those from the irrigated areas where farm products including vegetable comprised the main source of household diet.']"

In the morphometric space described, all dietary groups were significantly distinguished from each other. Furthermore, based on the data of extant murines, we were able to infer the dietary preferences of nine extinct genera of murine rodents, which have been described at the Iberoccitanian fossil sites from the Upper Miocene.Finally, Elliptic Fourier Analysis has been shown to constitute an interesting tool for inferring ecological preferences in extinct rodents, which are mostly recorded as isolated teeth in the fossil sites. The results of our study open up possibilities for establishing new comparisons in other mammalian groups, and for making ecological inferences of extinct taxa based upon information referring to their extant relatives. Furthermore, with the increasing development of phylogenetic studies, such inferences would help to map the evolutionary history of feeding habits.']"

Characterizing shifts in gut microbial communities allows for improved understanding of whether health changes are occurring due to increased human-macaque contact in a shared environment. Based on our analysis, workers’ gut microbiota may under certain circumstances be influenced by their exposure to macaques, but this would need to be confirmed in larger studies. The dispersion effects seen in macaques of Kosumpee Forest Park suggest that their altered diet and/or interaction with an urban environment may contribute to gut dysbiosis with unknown health consequences. Given the risk of transmission or respiratory irritation from ingesting or inhaling fecal microbes, exposed individuals and their employers should consider greater use of basic PPE and infection prevention methods, particularly proper hand hygiene. Targeted health protection and disease awareness promotion among forest park workers could limit opportunities for disease spillover from macaque populations into the broader community.']"

Obese Ossabaw pigs have increased transcript levels and evidence for aberrant function for steroidogenic enzymes in the delta 4 steroidogenic pathway of the ovary, which may account for their hyperandrogenemia. As the development of obesity and metabolic syndrome is multifactorial, the young Ossabaw pig is well-suited as a model animal in which to study the effects of obesity and metabolic syndrome on ovarian function. Future research in this animal model will focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying obesity-induced ovarian dysfunction. Ultimately, the Ossabaw mini-pig may be a useful animal model in which to develop therapies to improve fertility in obese and/or hyperandrogenemic females or to examine the effects of obesity on the maternal-fetal environment and offspring health.']"

The results of the present study provide another example of the new insights that can be provided by biomolecular approaches, bringing new evidence to bear on old questions. Perhaps most striking is that, even within a purely terrestrial C3 ecosystem, with no clear significant input from any aquatic foods, it has been possible to identify meaningful patterns in the diets of the living that determined to some extent their treatment at death. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic data from human and faunal remains from coeval funerary sites in the Rioja Alavesa demonstrate the existence of subtle but nevertheless significant isotopic differences among and between communities living in close proximity and burying their dead in caves and megalithic graves. These findings offer a valuable contribution to the debate on the underlying rationale behind mortuary variability in south-western Europe and suggest differences in the access to dietary resources and/or landscape use at a constrained geographic and chronological scale, with implications for the emergence of socioeconomic inequalities.']"
2014-02-19T00:00:00Z,Arachidonic Acid Enhances Turnover of the Dermal Skeleton: Studies on Zebrafish Scales,"['We conclude that an ARA-enriched diet, and consequent changes in whole-body fatty acid profile, influences scale mineralization and remodeling in existing (ontogenetic) and regenerating scales. The effects found in this study correlate with the skeletal deformities found as a result of sub-optimal dietary fatty acid composition. We thus conclude that the scale model can be used in aquaculture to quickly predict the effects of dietary composition on the entire skeleton. Feeding trials are notoriously difficult as they depend strongly on dose and composition of fatty acid supplementation (and many more variables). Many such studies though point towards increased turnover of bone as results of dietary fatty acid supplementation [21]. Small differences in mineralization of skeletal tissues are known to lead to malformations and fractures, especially when subjected to great forces [5], [7], [56]. We show that studies on elasmoid scales of zebrafish, including the regeneration paradigm, may provide an excellent tool for future studies to elucidate underlying molecular mechanisms of (dietary) fatty acids on subtle aspects of skeletal biology.']"
2015-12-15T00:00:00Z,Comparative Transcriptome Analysis in the Hepatopancreas Tissue of Pacific White Shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei Fed Different Lipid Sources at Low Salinity,"['This study reported the response of L. vannamei at low salinity to different sources of dietary lipid at the transcriptome level. The transcriptome analysis shows that when L. vannamei are under osmotic shock, the osmoregulation in shrimp depends on the source and content of fatty acid in the diet. The metabolism of SFA supplies sufficient energy for extra energy demand via β-oxidation of fatty acids. On the other hand, long-chain unsaturated fatty acid will participate in structural change of cell membrane to regulate the permeability and fluidity, and increase the cell membrane area on gills. A series of lipid metabolism pathways have enhanced the capability of L. vannamei to cope with osmotic shock and have a positive effect on growth and survival. However, osmoregulation is a complex physiological process and involves many pathways. The details of specific lipid metabolism for osmoregulation are still unclear and need further study. Based on the findings in this transcriptomic study, future research should be conducted to understand protein expression, and biochemical and physiological functions in shrimp at low salinity.']"

It may engage with self-regulation measures hypothesized to be mechanisms between mindfulness-based programs and blood pressure, including attention control, self-awareness and emotion regulation. Several modifiable determinants of blood pressure were significantly improved at 1 year-follow-up in participants not adhering to AHA guidelines at baseline including physical activity, DASH diet, salt intake, and alcohol consumption. Perceived stress was also significantly lowered. While findings are still early, and limited by being a single-arm clinical trial, they provide insight into informing the theory that, in the current social context and food environment, when we are surrounded by low cost palatable foods, sedentary occupations and pastimes, and fairly easily accessible alcohol, that mindfulness approaches, particularly those that deliberately engage with these health behaviors, may be utilized as a skillful approach to navigate through to optimal health.']"
2019-12-05T00:00:00Z,Sharing of gut microbial strains between selected individual sets of twins cohabitating for decades,"['The WSS strain-tracking analyses of the child and adult twins demonstrated the existence of individual-specific and shared microbial strain(s) between pairs of twins. Moreover, the adult twins ages from 36 to 80 years old showed a certain strain(s) between pair of twins was shared post-separation. We conclude that the potential exists for an individual to maintain the same strains of certain gut microbes for an extended time, possibly decades. While we do not know the origin of these shared microbes in the twins, these results suggest the possibility of strains shared between non-cohabitating twins for decades. However, for most individuals, environmental changes such as antibiotics and new diets that occur during aging can disrupt the stable landscape of the gut microbial community leading to the emergence of new strains. Numerous studies have described the importance of the gut microbial community interactions needed for essential functions in metabolism, training of the immune system and prevention of colonization by pathogens which could be impacted by these strain changes [3,9–13].']"
2016-07-08T00:00:00Z,The Effects of High Level Magnesium Dialysis/Substitution Fluid on Magnesium Homeostasis under Regional Citrate Anticoagulation in Critically Ill,"['In conclusion, the present study shows that the loss of Mg in RCA with conventional fluids is not balanced by the concentrations in commercially available dialysis/substitution fluids. Citrate anticoagulation of CRRT may lead to depletion of the bodies magnesium pool with potential for organ dysfunction. The difficult assessment of intracellular magnesium particularly in intensive care calls for magnesium loading tests [6] to reveal a possible magnesium deficit under continuous citrate anticoagulation. Standard low level of magnesium in substitution fluid does not prevent development of hypomagnesemia during citrate CRRT which increases daily requirements for magnesium to extra 2 to 3 grams of MgSO4. This requirement may increase with CRRT dosage above 20–25 ml/kg.h. A risk of magnesium depletion seems to be avoided with the novel fluid [21] which has magnesium level doubled (1.50 mmol/l) compared to the ordinary fluids used in intensive care however, validation and safety require further research. The fluid provided magnesium levels with no extra replenishment other than magnesium content in ordinary commercially available enteral and parenteral nutrition.']"

AD and AR grains are the most capable of changing the fatty acid contents. AV increased the palmitic acid content in milk, thus it may have been able to increase antimutagenic potential in fermented milk. The storage time leads to changes in fatty acid compositions in milk, so that stocked milk can have higher anticarcinogenic potential due to the high amount of oleic acid. Furthermore, storage can be used to decrease SFA and increase MUFA levels. Only high-lipidic matrix showed an increase of PUFA after fermentation. The CLA concentration did not increase significantly among kefir grains, storage time and fat concentration of the milk. Total fat was the only chemical characteristic not altered during fermentation and storage. Acidity and protein content increased while pH decreased during fermentation, but not due to storage time. Additionally, studies intending to optimize desaturase activity during fermentation conditions may contribute to obtaining a fermented product with a higher nutritional lipid quality.']"
2018-04-20T00:00:00Z,How does food addiction influence dietary intake profile?,"['Obesity epidemic is a major global health problem. Desire for highly energy-dense and reinforcing foods is reported to be contributing to weight gain by recent studies. Increased consumption of high-fat and high-sugar foods have resulted in increased number of food addicts in developed and developing countries. Consequently, presence of food addiction is related with energy dense food consumption and obesity; mainly abdominal fat accumulation. Since food addiction is predominantly influenced and provoked by compulsive behaviour and emotional and environmental factors such as stress, socio-cultural status and habitual characteristics, these factors should be taken into account in future studies. In addition, future randomised controlled researches would contribute to identifying characteristics, combinations and concentrations of ingredients which are potentially addictive. Efforts to improve nutrition knowledge and promote consciousness about food label reading may assist individuals to make more informed food choices. Corporate responsibility, public health approaches, environmental change and global efforts seem to be essential in reducing food and substance related problems involving obesity and other addiction symptoms.']"

Generally, the IPIs, anaemia and malnutrition are still public health problems among this indigenous community. IPIs were found to be significantly associated with anaemia. Meanwhile, the incidence of malnutrition (i.e., stunting, underweight and wasting) was higher among infected children with IPIs. Absence of toilets and close contact with animals was identified as significant predictors for IPIs. No parental formal education was significantly associated with anaemia. As for malnutrition, low household income was identified as a significant predicator for both stunting and underweight. This data strongly support the need for implementing health program aimed at improving nutrition, anaemic conditions and reducing the prevalence of infections, with potentially beneficial effects on cognitive and educational outcomes particularly among children. With effective control measures in place, these children will have a greater opportunity for a better future in terms of health and educational attainment, which will eventually put them on par socially and economically with other communities in Malaysia.']"

Risk factors of overweight included having overweight or obese mother, having high birth weight, being male gender, having low birth rank, being aged between 13–36 months, living in the Grassfield areas while being Muslim appeared as a protective factor. Preventive strategies should focus on sensitization campaigns to reduce overweight and obesity in parents and reinforcement of clinical measures such as weight gain surveillance during antenatal consultation which will help prevent children from high birth weight and overweight later in life. A clinical follow up of children with high birth weight is also necessary to prevent them from later childhood overweight. These campaigns and clinical measures should be especially strengthened in Grassfield area. Further studies including nutritional characteristics are of great interest to understand the association with religion, child age and ecological area in this age group. This will help in refining preventive strategies against childhood overweight and obesity in Cameroon and comparable or neighboring countries']"

Both, results from plot and filed scale experiments provide sufficient evidence to support feasibility for the UAV-modeling approach and potential for broad scalability to other grass species, soil types and weather conditions, but the testing and validation of this hypothesis warrants further carefully conducted investigations.Importantly, this study supports the use of fine scale resolution maps based upon UAV-derived estimations of pasture biomass to guide grazing management decisions. Further, this work also demonstrates that it is technically possible to link UAV data and process-based crop models for use as a decision support tool to monitor, assess and plan grazing management. However, to become a practical approach for use by land managers and farmers future technical work must focus on the automation of UAV data processing and mapping, and pasture modeling steps to allow for rapid output data that can be available near real-time.']"

Higher predation capacity of summerform C. chinensis was found than that of winterforms, shown as higher attack rate, shorter handling time as well as higher theoretical maximum number consumed by H. axyridis. We found that the stronger predation of H. axyridis on summerforms was likely due to the higher nutritional returns, e.g. higher protein content and less foraging costs when dealing with summerforms, smaller size, and softer and thinner exoskeleton. The high predation capacities of H. axyridis on both morphotypes of psyllids indicated its great potential as a biocontrol agent of C. chinensis. Based on the inverse density-dependent predation of type II functional response and the great predation capacities of H. axyridis on the two morphotypes, the control of C. chinensis should start early in the season to suppress the winterforms by inundative release. Further study of the control efficiency of two morphotypes of C. chinensis by H. axyridis in the field is necessary to extend our findings to on-farm pear psylla management.']"
2018-01-23T00:00:00Z,Independent associations and effect modification between lifetime substance use and recent mood disorder diagnosis with household food insecurity,"['The results of this study suggest that substance use and poor mental health are potential independent or interdependent factors that contribute to food insecurity. By tailoring prevention and intervention efforts, such as screening for the significant correlates reported in this study, strides may be made to alleviate the preventable public health issue of food insecurity. The results of some of the associations with food insecurity are difficult to interpret (e.g., potential potective effect of lifetime substance use related to food insecurity) and require further study. The conceptual framework (Fig 1) suggests that coping and resilience are underlying features that warrant further investigation as potential explanatory mechanisms that could mediate or moderate food insecurity, substance use, and mental ill health in the context of different macro-level drivers and mental health, nutrition, and behavioural pathways. Longitudinal research and further investigations of coping and resilience may discern explanatory mechanisms that could mediate or moderate substance use, poor mental health, and food insecurity. Finally, customized intervention research can help determine effective ways to reduce substance use, poor mental health, and food insecurity.']"

The data highlighted several nutritionally interesting features of GP tubers. These include the following: (i) increased amounts of provitamin A carotenoids, αTC (vitamin E), phytoene and phytofluene; (ii) greater than 82% retention of αTC and carotenoids other than phytofluene during boiling; (iii) relative bioaccessibilities of provitamin A, xanthophylls, phytoene, phytofluene and αTC similar to that reported for other vegetables; and (iv) uptake across the apical surface of Caco-2 cells from micelles generated during simulated digestion of GP ranging from 14–20% for provitamin A carotenoids and xanthophylls, 53% for αTC, 43–45% for phytoene and 23–27% for phytofluene. These data suggest GP has the potential to contribute to the provitamin A and αTC nutritional requirements of populations at risk of vitamin A and E deficiency, especially in countries where potato is an important staple food. Their use for dietary interventions should, therefore, be considered by national and international programs aimed at preventing vitamins A and E deficiency.']"

Our results show that along with BMI, waist circumference is related to higher earnings in Indonesia. The findings of this paper indicate that the alternative measures of body composition are important predictors of wage premium. A plausible explanation for our findings is that people with lower BMI, suffering from under-nutrition, face wage penalty and overweight people earn wage premium [21]. Reverse causality is also plausible i.e. getting a job increases income, which then makes it easier to buy food and gain weight.There are two important limitations regarding our results. First, the results are based on male individuals who are between 40 and 55. Therefore, we unable to generalize the results for the overall population. Second, we have only studied the association between measures of body composition and labor income. Although individual fixed effects absorb unobserved time-invariant health conditions as well as preferences, we are unable to control for time-varying unobserved traits.']"

The consumption of apples and pears was associated with reduced risks of oral cavity and laryngeal cancers; the consumption of citrus fruits and fresh tomatoes was associated with a reduced risk of oral cavity cancer; the consumption of bananas was associated with a reduced risk of oropharynx cancer; the consumption of broccoli, cabbage, and collard greens was associated with reduced risks of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers; and the consumption of carrots and fresh fruits was associated with a reduced risk of hypopharyngeal cancer. The findings of our study support the adoption of preventive measures for HNC that encourage the consumption of minimally processed foods. Incentives may take the form of public education policies and address nutritional status control, oral hygiene, restriction of alcohol consumption, and cessation of tobacco use. The facilitation of access to minimally processed foods through public policies, such as subsidy provision for home and community gardens and free markets, is essential, and will strengthen the development and consolidation of policies that aim to create environments conducive to healthy behavior.']"

Specifically, recent studies estimate that when started in early life, a large proportion of chronic diseases like cancer and cardiovascular diseases are preventable by reducing obesity and excess weight, and increasing physical activity [62, 63]. This systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes the existing literature on the association between SES and obesity, highlighting the need for public health strategies in population subgroups most vulnerable to obesity (due to easy access to cheap, unhealthy foods and lack of physical activity) and the need for effective strategies that have the best chance of reducing obesity at early ages. The lack of information regarding the association between childhood and life course SES and obesity in developing countries highlights the need for empirical studies to inform obesity prevention strategies in developing countries.

Cow and buffalo milk shows differences at fluorescence emission appeared at band position 382 nm, 440 nm, 505 nm and 525 nm both in classical geometry (right angle) setup as well as front face fluorescence setup. In front face fluorescence geometry, synchronous fluorescence emission shows clear differences at 410 nm and 440 nm between the milk samples of both these species. These fluorescence emissions correspond to fats, vitamin-A and β-carotene. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) further highlighted these difference by showing clear separation between the two data sets on the basis of features obtained from their fluorescence emission spectra. These results indicate that classical geometry (fixed excitation) as well as front face (synchronous fluorescence emission) of cow and buffalo milk nutrients could be used as fingerprint from identification point of view. This same approach can effectively be used for the determination of adulterants in the milk and other dairy products.']"

This decline has resulted in increased inputs (e.g., labor, expenses) by beekeepers to monitor and treat colonies in crisis, as well generates uncertainty in the supply of colonies for commercial pollination or other bee-derived products. In tandem with the recently sequenced genome of A. mellifera [48], an in vitro system comprised of honey bee cells will facilitate studies in functional genomics and/or target mechanisms of pathogenesis through infection with viruses, for example. Honey bees are also host to a plethora of non-pathogenic, horizontally acquired microbes [49]; a host-derived culture system could cast light on mechanisms of host tolerance and nutritional consequences of harboring these symbionts. In addition, the introduction of foreign gene constructs or knockdown of specific gene targets through RNA interference are attractive applications that would permit questions to be asked about subcellular and molecular changes involved with honey bee development or metabolic responses to pesticides and other xenobiotics.']"

We also show, however, that bumble bees may be somewhat resilient to a pulsed exposure because they exhibit dose-dependent recuperation of brood production when exposure ends. We acknowledge that to interpret the environmental relevance of our findings for wild bumble bee colonies additional studies are necessary. These should seek to establish whether recuperation from pulsed exposure to neonicotinoids occurs during extended exposures and for other demographically important endpoints besides brood production. Finally, the severity of imidacloprid's impact on bumble bees appears to be highly sensitive to its dietary level even within the currently recognized environmentally realistic range [21]. Unfortunately, this range is based on scant published data [56] and more widespread surveys of residues in crops and colonies, such as those recently begun in the USA [25], are therefore urgently required.""]"

Without prior knowledge regarding the ingredient composition of the feeds, the resulting effect of consuming different commercial feeds are significantly reflected in the growth parameters, nutritional value, gut morphology and transcriptomic profile analysed. The effects of the feed compositions used by different manufacturers onto the fish could be further understood by studying the global genes expression profile in greater detail. The expression level of fads6 and other genes was found to be potentially suitable as a bio-indicator to identify wild-caught Asian seabass from farmed ones. Goblet cell numbers in the mid-gut section of pellet-fed fish were lower than those of controls, indicating potentially negative effects on fish health. By considering the overall effects observed, we would recommend to farmers favouring feeds for the culture of Asian seabass that help to maintain the quality, not just increasing the quantity of the end product (i.e. the fillet).']"

Most of the abundant bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes living in symbiosis with Antarctic sponges have been described as significant participants in nitrogen and carbon biogeochemical cycles. In this way, we can suggest that symbioses between microorganisms and Antarctic sponges not only contributes to the nutrition of both parts, but also to Antarctic marine ecosystem. Our work indicates that Antarctic marine sponges harbor a greater microbial diversity than the seawater around them, across the three domains. We found different community composition of symbionts compared to the surrounding planktonic communities, expanding previous observations for Bacteria and including the Antarctic environment. Finally, this work shows that even when sharing an important part of the microbial community with those from other ecosystems, Antarctic sponges have a particular signature in terms of their three-domain diversity and composition. Further functional analysis (e.g. metatranscriptomics), will provide the knowledge needed to fully understand the role that these specific microbiomes have as part of this important marine symbiosis in Antarctica.']"

The current paleopathological study provides further evidence about his health status, by revealing that he suffered from both diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis and obesity. These results, along with those of the isotopic analysis, give a glimpse into the lifestyle of the famous astronomer, revealing the dietary excesses a 16th century high-ranking individual could have afforded (high caloric intake and presumably excessive alcohol consumption). They also reveal the possible health consequences such a prestigious way of life could have had. Although this study does not allow a definite diagnosis to be reached, it highlights plausible reasons for the sudden illness and premature death of the famous astronomer, notably conditions resulting from so-called civilization diseases, which occur with high frequency in DISH patients.']"
2016-05-04T00:00:00Z,Inorganic Nutrients Increase Humification Efficiency and C-Sequestration in an Annually Cropped Soil,"['Findings of this field study are consistent with the findings of previous laboratory incubations [14,15], that an adequate supply of N, P and S can significantly increase the proportion of crop residue-C sequestered as FF-SOM-C. Our approach did not target primary plant productivity or C input (which was held constant) as the mechanism to improve C sequestration, but rather the humification efficiency of the soil microbiome as a whole, by deliberately manipulating the C:N:P:S ratio of added inputs. This explains the conundrum of the surprisingly low C sequestration under many long-term crop residue retention systems where the balance of nutrients is not considered along with C input. It also calls into question policies related to soil-C sequestration that do not account for the supply and value of the stabilising inorganic nutrients required, particularly if the sequestration is expected to occur deeper in the soil profile. In addition, current “nutrient-use efficiency” approaches to crop nutrition may inadvertently limit the supply of nutrients for the formation of new FF-SOM, by applying only sufficient nutrient for crop uptake. Furthermore, a lack of available nutrient supply following the addition of high energy C-rich crop residue may indeed exacerbate the mineralisation of pre-existing FF-SOM, via a priming effect, causing an overall net loss of FF-SOM. However, it must also be recognised that the nutrients need to be supplied in balance, otherwise those that cannot be sequestered into the FF-SOM pool may be prone to loss.Our methodology, based on the provision of supplementary inorganic nutrients to meet the stoichiometric ratio requirements of SOM to achieve a humification efficiency of 30%, was effective at increasing soil-C by up to 5.5 t C ha-1 over a five year period, and reversed a declining trend in soil-C that continued where supplementary nutrients were not applied. The mass balance suggests there was little if any nutrient loss from the system that could contribute to adverse environmental outcomes but further research is needed to quantify and validate this. The intensive cultivation used for incorporation did not preclude the sequestration of soil-C, as is often assumed, but rather assisted in the thorough mixing of soil to improve microbial contact with residue-C and nutrient sources. These observations also suggest a need for reconsideration of crop nutrition approaches in no-till farming systems, where crop residues remain on the soil surface, if increased C-sequestration is an expected outcome.We gratefully acknowledge an anonymous reviewer whose insightful comments which greatly improved the manuscript.']"
2015-07-31T00:00:00Z,"Experimental Barley Flour Production in 12,500-Year-Old Rock-Cut Mortars in Southwestern Asia","[""The Late Natufian ability to prepare flour in a significant quantity and quality may well point toward the production of unleavened bread, as this was a possible major product that could have been made from flour in the Late Epipaleolithic. Other meals (such as pancakes and donuts) could not have been prepared without portable vessels or ovens.The possibility that the Natufians consumed flour per se cannot be firmly ruled out; still we see it as being inconsistent the frequent appearance of the narrow conical mortar—which we have experimentally demonstrated to be an efficient peeling device—in Late Natufian sites, as flour can be eaten per se without de-husking the grains.It should also be stressed that the invention of bread was a significant dietary and nutritional advance that greatly improved human food quality. Bread was and still is a major source of grain nutrition (much more than flour, groats or porridge). Bread is a good source of carbohydrates and other nutrients and is easily digested; it can also be carried as provisions. Numerous sickle blades with typical gloss resulting from harvesting cereals have been recorded [29] in more than 80 years of research of Natufian sites; they have been replicated successfully in field experiments [30]. Thus, sickles, threshing floors, conical mortars and milling utensils (S1 Fig) [31] were significant inventions of the Natufian culture, all essential for exploiting wild cereals as an important source of carbohydrates.The technological advance from wide- to narrow conical mortars represented a major dietary change (S1A:1, S1F, S1C and S1D Fig). Meals and gruel made of husked or partly peeled ripe or unripe grains in the Early Natufian were supported in the Late Natufian by the production of flour from dehusked ripe grains and consequently the baking of unleavened bread. The dietary change from groat meals to barley bread, which probably occurred during the Late Natufian seems to have become wide spread in small villages such as Huzuq Musa and Qarassa 3 [32]. In fact, we estimated that the Huzuq Musa grain processing machinery could have produced sufficient barley bread to feed the site’s estimated inhabitants.The development of the narrow conical mortar facilitated Late Natufian people to produce what has become the Western world's most widespread staple food. The innovation of bread-making naturally followed the long-term consumption of dishes containing mainly small grains with the addition of some hulled large-grained barley [8]. With the development of a new agro-technological system, including threshing floors, peeling utensils and milling devices, the Natufians bequeathed to their Neolithic successors a technical advancement that contributed to the establishment of agricultural societies.""]"
2013-08-05T00:00:00Z,To Supplement or Not to Supplement: A Metabolic Network Framework for Human Nutritional Supplements,"[""One challenge in the application of FBA to study metabolism of multicellular organisms is choosing an appropriate objective function for the organism or tissue [9]. However, muscle tissue as compared to other tissues has more defined states, which we can be modeled: contraction and recovery/growth. Recovery from certain types of training leads to muscle tissue hypertrophy which is achieved by increasing the contractile proteins and scaffolding proteins in the muscle tissue. The contractile proteins differ slightly based on the muscle type: 1, 2a, 2x, and 2b. However, the amino acid composition of these proteins is similar enough that according to the model, amino acid supplementation effects protein synthesis equally (data not shown). This means that, similar supplementation regimes could be appropriate no matter the type of training goal. However, determining if there are differences between recovery and growth, one can slightly alter the objective function. For Type 1 muscle tissue (slow twitch), one could look at an objective function that would model increasing the concentration of mitochondria, while for Type 2 muscle tissue (fast twitch), the contractile protein synthesis may be more appropriate. To elucidate the differences even more, an objective function which incorporates a combination of mitochondrial proliferation and contractile muscle protein synthesis can be used to differentiate Type 2a, Type 2x, and Type 2b muscle tissues. Furthermore, the model predicts supplementation from fasting normo-aminoacidemia and post-absorptive states. These profiles were obtained by averaging the profiles of multiple individuals. Perhaps, by knowing the specific amino acids levels of an athlete or patient, one can use this model to predict an individualized supplement regimen appropriate for which muscle tissue recovery is desired. In addition, we use plasma concentration levels of amino acids as a proxy for amino acid flux. Differing concentrations can lead to differing results. Ultimately, we are looking at which uptake fluxes need to be increased to achieve the desired results. While our results are concurrent with literature, we can conceive that this can be used for personalized supplementations strategy. If we knew the concentrations and/or amino acid uptake fluxes of individuals, we can determine the most effective supplementation strategy to achieve the individual's objective.We also recognize that the model used here is less complex than previously published muscle models [9], [11]. However, our model was curated at the level of muscle cell metabolism and includes specific protein synthesis for contractile protein complex, while the other models do not. Yet, increasing the complexity by incorporating the specific protein synthesis into other published muscle models, can potentially allow us to investigate other nutrients and metabolites often used for supplementation. In addition, the model only investigates acute response to increasing the uptake flux and does not implement genetic controls, which can lead to increased muscle synthesis post exercise. However, these results are still pertinent because we make the assumption that the muscle tissue is primed for protein synthesis, and we ask under this state, increasing which amino acid uptake fluxes are necessary to take advantage of protein synthesis.This paper documents a novel and potentially important application for FBA. When looking at different nutrition, supplementation, and amino acid profiles, we gain a perspective on how this can affect the entire network. Not only did we predict amino acid supplementation and combinations that increased protein synthesis already found in literature, we showed that there can be various supplementation regimes that produce the same results but have differing metabolic landscapes. This gives us another tool to study nutrition and supplementation more effectively for promoting health. The results we obtained in this study can be considered as a proof of concept that introduces the prospect of using systems biology to investigate how supplementation and nutrition can affect human muscle metabolism. Clearly, additional work must be conducted both experimentally and computationally to refine the model and the perturbation protocols. The recent community efforts to build human tissue metabolic models would be very of great value for future work in this area, as well as conducting more detailed animal and human studies to validate the models and the predictions they make.""]"
2020-01-16T00:00:00Z,First adaptation of quinoa in the Bhutanese mountain agriculture systems,"['Quinoa, a new crop in Bhutan, has been successfully adapted and acclimatized in just over three years since its first introduction in 2015 to the unique mountain agriculture of this country in the Himalayas. Due to the versatile capacity of the crop to adapt to different growing conditions, quinoa has successfully adapted under the challenging mountain farming environments where different abiotic stresses, like varying precipitation patterns, drought, high temperature, frost and cold temperature, limit farmers’ choices of food crops and ability to ecological intensification of the cropping systems. The cultivation has been successfully demonstrated to the farmers across the country through on-farm demonstration and four varieties have been recommended with an indicative sowing time for the different agroecological zones and cropping systems. In the higher elevations above 1800 masl, spring sowing has been found most feasible. In these areas, a winter crop of quinoa after the harvest of main crops like potato and wheat has been partially successful but more research needs to be done for identifying genotypes and critical seeding time so that quinoa can escape frosts before anthesis. In the lower elevations below 1800 masl, sowing in autumn in the rainfed dryland, where quinoa is cultivated as a rainfed crop after the harvest of potato and maize, produced the best results. A winter crop after rice harvest in the terraced paddy fields is currently being evaluated with different genotypes. In this system, there is a need to identify suitable varieties with a growing period of less than 150 days, right sowing time and crop appropriate management practices.From a new crop in 2015, quinoa has already spread in all 20 Dzongkhags of the country and across all agroecological zones with an estimated area of about 500 acres in 2018 (200 ha). Quinoa is now aggressively being promoted as a climate resilient and a nutrient dense crop across the country in all the agroecological zones to enhance food and nutritional security, and as a potential niche organic crop for the regional export market (China & India).Quinoa is a new crop for the Bhutanese farmers and the overall understanding and management practices of this crop for their local mountain farming environments is still too poor for them. As the crop has not been previously evaluated in depth in this Himalayan region, the technical information available on quinoa is also scanty, and the basic information needed to judge agricultural activities to be done is very often partial or absent. Despite a high priority accorded to the promotion of quinoa cultivation, an all-out approach of the agriculture research and extension, to rapidly upscale the cultivation of quinoa at national level, is faced with numerous challenges. Among them, we can note limited access to quinoa germplasm [5, 52, 53], absence of best crop management practices under subsistence mountain farming systems, lack of knowledge on pest and diseases, harvesting and processing. Research and extension services of the Department of Agriculture have to face and address these challenges for consolidating the quinoa value chain. There is a need for package of practices for quinoa crop when grown under different agroecological conditions, organic production and marginal environments.The Department of Agriculture has initiated quinoa research and development in all 20 Dzongkhags to address the agronomic and seed related issues. Developing and implementing a long-term strategy and a program for managing quinoa cultivation and consumption on the principles of sustainable development imply to consider the whole agrifood system with a territorial approach. Being a new crop for Bhutanese people, the technical knowledge and awareness about quinoa’s nutritional benefits is very limited. Now, quinoa has been essentially introduced to enhance the food and nutritional security of the Bhutanese population by promoting it as nutritious health food, which requires its inclusion in the traditional cuisines through adequate research and demonstration efforts. In parallel with resolving agronomic issues [49], the absence of marketing channels to sell farmers’ small household surpluses, which is absent today, must be resolved.']"

Though apparently simple, such changes in people’s life are difficult to maintain and in most of the cases patients struggle to follow these recommendations. Due to the complexity of this condition, it is vital to identify weight loss methods by which subjects can successfully achieve long-term results. In this respect, using fibers is a potential tool to supplement diet in weight management due to their satiety aspects, as well as in modulating the gut microbiota. Here in this study we have identified the potential of arabinogalactan and inulin in stimulating a gut community more related to a lean profile. Metabolically, arabinogalactan fermentation showed a higher production of propionate when compared to n-butyrate in the obese microbiota fermentations. In general, lean microbiota produced more n-butyrate from the fermentation of both substrates when compared to the obese microbiota. This would be interesting to investigate in light of the potential activation of different GPCRs by these SCFA. However, these effects should be more studied in humans focusing especially in the role of these fibers in satiety.']"
2017-04-12T00:00:00Z,"Wild inside: Urban wild boar select natural, not anthropogenic food resources","['In general, WB in urban areas use anthropogenic food such as garbage as fallback food when access to natural resources is limited. Even though urban landscapes strongly dominated by anthropogenic landscape variables, macroscopic stomach types do not mirror the overall landscape. The stomach types indicate a selective food choice within different natural landscape structures. The quality of the consumed food therefore does not depend on the origin per se, but on local characteristics and presence of natural patches to forage. Our results showed wild boar forage abundant, natural resources within urban areas, hence we assume it became more tolerant to disturbance by human urbanites. Moreover, free ranging wild boar switch diets only using anthropogenic resources (e.g. garbage) easy to exploit and more abundant than natural resources.WB can benefit of anthropogenic landscape structures, where they can find highly energetic resources. Whatsoever, access to natural resources is mandatory and drives the amount of protein, starch, fat or fibre in wild boar stomachs in urban as well as rural environments.']"

Due to the epidemiological transition which is occurring in this rural area, it is recommended that health interventions which aim to control risk factors at population level should be planned and implemented by the provincial government in order to slow the progress of the coming non-communicable diseases epidemic. In conclusion, our findings highlighted the importance of reaching out to poor rural communities with messages regarding the impact of diet, smoking and alcohol consumption on general health.\nImplications of the study\nThis study in the Dikgale HDSS provides baseline data on risk factors for NCDs and these epidemiological data will be of value if used by the health policy makers in developing interventions for chronic disease risk factor prevention and control [54, 55] in the Limpopo Province. This study suggests that chronic NCDs are common amongst adults in rural areas and, therefore, we propose that primary health care services increasingly accommodate screening and treatment for chronic NCDs and NCD risk factors.\n']"
2019-10-25T00:00:00Z,"Shift in trophic niches of soil microarthropods with conversion of tropical rainforest into plantations as indicated by stable isotopes (15N, 13C)","['Of the six species studied occurring across the four land-use systems we detected significant shifts in trophic niches in three of them, but trophic niches of the other three species also varied in a similar way. Notably, the shifts were due to both changes in trophic position (δ15N values) as well as changes in the use of basal resources (δ13C values) with the shift in trophic position towards higher trophic levels in transformed ecosystems. The observed shifts in trophic niches are conform to the view that oribatid mites are generalist feeders able to change their diet according to changes in resource availability. Notably, the shifts in trophic niches were most pronounced between more natural systems (rainforest and jungle rubber) and high intensity land-use systems (rubber and oil palm plantations). Overall, the results suggest that the ability of oribatid mite species to colonize a wide range of land-use systems including rainforest and monoculture plantations is likely based on trophic plasticity and the ability to shift both their trophic level and the basal resource they rely on.']"

We investigate the Late Iron Age (3rd-1st c BC) necropolis of Seminario Vescovile (Verona, Italy) applying a suite of different methods (statistical analysis of funerary, isotopic, and LEH data). Funerary data provide evidence for the presence of a nuanced differentiation of mortuary customs, which are primarily correlated to the age of the individuals. When combined with the analysis of stable isotopes and LEH, funerary data suggest at SV a lack of substantial social differences, though considering the real representativeness of the analyzed individuals, which likely depict an homogenous (and possibly low-status) segment of the original population. This study represents a preliminary step toward a better understanding of the biocultural features characterizing the Cenomani population of Italy. The future addition of supplementary data (archaeological, biochemical, and biomolecular) will increase the resolution of our analyses. A detailed bioarchaeological comparison with other Celtic contexts from Northern Italy will provide a clearer contextualization of the results from SV.']"
2014-05-16T00:00:00Z,Laparoscopic versus Open Radical Cystectomy in Bladder Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Comparative Studies,"['Sixteen trials (545 cases and 620 controls) assessing LRC vs. ORC were considered suitable for meta-analysis including seven prospective and nine retrospective studies. Although LRC was associated with longer operative time, patients with LRC might benefit from significantly fewer overall complications, less blood loss, shorter length of hospital stay, less need of blood transfusion, less narcotic analgesic requirement, shorter time to ambulation, shorter time to regular diet, fewer positive surgical margins, fewer positive lymph node, lower distant metastasis rate and fewer death. Our data suggest that LRC is a safe, feasible and minimally invasive alternative to ORC when performed by experienced surgeons in selected patients. However, despite our rigorous methodological review, because of the inherent limitations of the included studies and the long-term oncologic results are not available, further large sample prospective, multicentric, long-term follow-up studies and Randomized control trials should be undertaken to confirm our findings.']"

NMR-based metabolomics has been shown to be an efficient technique to investigate the metabolic perturbation due to copper accumulation and PA treatment. The changes of endogenous metabolites in urine and serum samples from models of copper-laden rats, model+PA and control rats were identified by PLS-DA. The toxicity of accumulated copper is proven to be selective and has affected a number of metabolic pathways. A comparison between the current findings and zinc therapy warrants future investigation, as treatment with zinc was found to normalize the serum free copper concentration [51]. To complement the current study, future proteomic and immunohistochemistry studies may provide further insights into the metabolic mechanism and discover more effective treatments for WD. In summary, the current results indicate that the 1H NMR-based metabolomics has the potential to uncover the metabolic response of copper toxicity that could provide better a understanding of the metabolic effect and efficacy of drug treatments.']"
2013-06-12T00:00:00Z,"Pliocene Paleoenvironments of Southeastern Queensland, Australia Inferred from Stable Isotopes of Marsupial Tooth Enamel","['Despite the fact the Pliocene marks the spread of grasses around Australia [13], the depositional area of the Chinchilla Sand was not dominated by C4 grasslands. Instead, the environment was more mixed, with a clear indication of abundant C3 plants, potentially a wet tropical sclerophyll forest. The Pliocene Macropus sp. indet. at Chinchilla consumed both C3 and C4 plants. The proportion of C4 grasses in their diets may be confirmed in the future through dental microwear analyses. Both Euryzygoma dunense and Troposodon sp. indet. were mixed feeders with a tendency towards C3 plants, while the confirmed forest wallaby Protemnodon sp. indet. subsisted almost entirely on C3 plants, indicating the likely presence of trees. These inferences are confirmed by our comparison of fossil isotopic values with those of modern Macropus spp. from different regions of Australia. We reconstruct the Chinchilla Sand fossil locality as significantly wetter and more vegetated during the Pliocene than today, potentially representing an environment with forests in addition to tropical grasslands and wetlands. Further exploration at this site and neighboring Pleistocene localities will give us a better indication of paleoecology and shifts in paleoenvironments in relation to climate change in the region.']"

These transcription factors are known to control organ growth during early development, with dysfunction of either protein found to deregulate and alter organ size development [52-55], and they may be related to the changes in organ size and growth seen in offspring that are prenatally exposed to HFD [56-59], suggesting much broader functions during development. The findings of the present study, showing these transcription factors to both co-exist and affect ENK and be inversely related in hypothalamic neurons, underscore their functions during development, and provide the first evidence that they may be involved in controlling the development of neurons expressing ENK and possibly other neuropeptides or neurotransmitters. Through this relationship to neurochemical systems in the brain, the suppressive effects of HFD exposure on TEF and YAP activity may have a variety of detrimental consequences, affecting both the behavioral and physiological traits in the offspring.']"

Our results show that more than 48% of total P in swine manure, 87% of total P in dairy manure and 69% of total P in broiler litter was water-soluble P (Pt extracted by Water and NaHCO3), which is easily lost into the environment. It is reported that 1582 Gg of animal P was presumably lost to the environment in 2006 in China, which is a big threat to water quality [3]. Therefore, an integrated management practice is necessary to reduce manure P losses at animal farm scale, including animal diet modification, livestock manure collection, storage and field application.']"
2015-10-08T00:00:00Z,European Sea Bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) Immune Status and Disease Resistance Are Impaired by Arginine Dietary Supplementation,"['The present study clearly shows inhibition of some immune mechanisms in the European sea bass as result of dietary arginine supplementation, which led to higher disease susceptibility. These results may be due to the direct role of arginine on cell activation and differentiation leading to a restrained humoral response, or to the action of arginine on cell communications by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. This study provides additional information for deciphering the two-edged effects of a dietary surplus of arginine, as arginine supplementation may produce widely different biological responses depending on the disease process where it is provided. As in human studies [42], we are therefore still in the process of identifying in fish which processes are benefited by arginine-supplemented diets. In fish, the efficiency and balance of the immune system are highly dependent and susceptible to several external and internal varying factors. It is, therefore, of utmost importance to have full knowledge of each specific situation (e.g. developmental stage, fish species, etc.) and conditions (e.g. water temperature, densities, water quality, etc.), while supplementing aquafeeds aiming the improvement of fish health.']"

Strategies for reducing high ST over the weekend should focus on replacing ST with other activities of healthy living. Strategies should particularly focus on reducing the high ST among males to prevent the potential future health consequences. The study findings can also inform the development of public health messages. Future work may aim at understanding related health effects (both negative and positive) of other, non-screen based sedentary behaviours. Further research should also focus on longitudinal assessments throughout childhood and pubertal stage to establish trends and changes in ST and non-screen-based sedentary behaviours as well as relationships between TV viewing and poor diets.']"

It would be effective to improve affordable access to regular follow-ups including promotion of heathy behaviors and regular use of health and education services. This study could infer that people who have the lowest income are at increased risk of worsening symptoms due to lack of adherence and detrimental lifestyle behaviors and need to be assisted. In the future, the national health care system should be capable of generating and sustaining capacities of diabetes educators like MoPoTsyo’s peer educators.

2020-01-15T00:00:00Z,Biogeographic study of human gut-associated crAssphage suggests impacts from industrialization and recent expansion,"['The geographic distribution of crAssphage is global [14, 16], but as observed here, the prevalence of crAssphage is lower within samples from more traditional, hunter-gatherer populations such as the Hadza from Tanzania and Matses from Peru. The overall picture from the data presented here is that crAssphage prevalence is associated with an industrialized lifestyle/diet, but with no associations to health, age, sex, or body-size variables. CrAssphage strains from the same individual tend to cluster together phylogenetically. Overall, crAssphage shows limited biogeographic clustering as seen in cases of a recent population expansion event. We estimate that this expansion occurred approximately within the past few hundred years; however, the mechanism behind this expansion remains uncertain. Alternatively, this pattern can be attributed to a passive effect of a population expansion within its bacterial host(s) rather than an active expansion event within the bacteriophage. Future research elucidating what bacterial species serve as hosts of crAssphage sensu stricto will open avenues for exploring such hypotheses regarding host-bacteriophage co-evolution.']"
2014-05-21T00:00:00Z,Dietary Specialization during the Evolution of Western Eurasian Hominoids and the Extinction of European Great Apes,"['Contrary to previous interpretations, our microwear analyses show that leaves and stems were not a primary dietary component for any hominoid from Western Eurasia, which are interpreted instead as frugivores (O. bambolii) and/or hard-object feeders (e.g., P. catalaunicus). Whereas some of the studied taxa fall comfortably within these two dietary categories, many of them (such as Hispanopithecus species) seem to be intermediate, suggesting that they have no extant dietary analog in the comparative sample.From a evolutionary perspective, our results indicate that hominoids from Western Eurasia experienced a progressive dietary diversification between 14 and 7 Ma, from the presumably ancestral condition of (semi-)terrestrial hard-object feeding shown by G. alpani. In Western and Central Europe, this diversification might have been triggered by changes in habitat structure (more densely-forested environments), coupled with competitive exclusion and new locomotor adaptations related to arboreal feeding (as shown by P. catalaunicus). Other taxa from this area (especially the species of Hispanopithecus) apparently combined soft and hard fruits in their diets. The high behavioral plasticity of extant great apes allows them to survive in front of a marked environmental instability (resulting in spatial/temporal uncertainty of preferred fruit resources) [122], [123]. Similarly, the suspensory adaptations of Hispanopithecus species (enabling a more efficient foraging on terminal branches), coupled with the exploitation of harder food items during the unfavorable season, might have allowed them to temporarily overcome the progressive environmental deterioration. Ultimately, however, the restriction and fragmentation of their preferred habitats would have led to their extinction from Western and Central Europe. In contrast, Ou. macedoniensis survived longer in the more open and arid landscapes of Eastern Europe by displaying a more terrestrial trophic niche based on hard food items, whereas O. bambolii persisted even longer in the Tusco-Sardinian Paleobioprovince by displaying a versatile frugivorous diet, until its insular ecosystem was connected to the mainland.The failure by any of these taxa to adapt to folivory in the face of environmental changes towards increased seasonality might be attributable to their specialized (although diverging) trophic niches. The contrasting environmental changes experienced by the respective habitats of Hispanopithecus (more deciduous and open forests) and Ou. macedoniensis (less open and more bushy habitats), coupled with their strikingly divergent trophic niches, suggest that great-ape vulnerability to environmental change is not attributable to a frugivorous bias per se [122], but rather to the adaptation to whatever hyperspecialized trophic niche.']"
2018-07-18T00:00:00Z,"The osteology of Periptychus carinidens: A robust, ungulate-like placental mammal (Mammalia: Periptychidae) from the Paleocene of North America","['New specimens of the Paleocene periptychid, Periptychus carinidens, are described here. These include some of the most complete specimens known for the species and provide new anatomical information on this abundant taxon, which was among the first eutherian mammals to evolve moderately large body size and distinct adaptations (particularly related to diet) after the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. These specimens also provide new data with which to examine periptychid and Paleocene mammal phylogeny and paleobiology.Periptychus is an unusual taxon in that it unites a suite of dental, cranial and postcranial specializations with an otherwise relatively generalized skeleton. The overall shape of the skull of Periptychus is broadly concurrent with the inferred plesiomorphic eutherian condition [54,69,108], albeit more robust in its overall construction. Derived dental specializations included crenulated enamel, enlarged upper and lower premolars with a tall centralised paracone/protoconid and lingual shoulder. The relatively small canines and broad bunodont postcanine teeth, combined with a greatly expanded mandibular angle, raised mandibular condyle and broad zygomatic arches indicate Periptychus was herbivorous. The enlarged premolars are highly suggestive of an animal adapted towards durophagy and adept at crushing tough foodstuffs.The postcranial skeleton of Periptychus is that of a robust, stout-limbed animal that was incipiently mediportal (adapted to moving slowly over land but also having some characteristics conducive to quick movements when needed) and adopted a plantigrade stance. Features of note in the forelimb of Periptychus include: a shortened humerus relative to the ulna and radius; a hemispherical humeral head with large but low tuberosities; a broad and elongate deltopectoral region; a reduced insertion for teres major on the humerus; expanded lateral and medial epicondyles; an open humeroradial joint, a relatively straight ulna with little posterior bowing of the diaphysis or anterior bowing of the olecranon process; a broad carpus with enlarged centrale; and relatively short digital bones terminating in hoof-like unguals.Key features of the hindlimb of Periptychus include: a relatively unspecialized innominate with a widely open acetabulum; robust femoral trochanters including a third trochanter; the greater trochanter of the femur is tall but does not extend beyond the femoral head; a dorsoplantarly compressed astragalus which in articulation is wedged between the tibia and fibula permitting the fibula to contact the calcaneum; and a retained tibiale.In describing the anatomy of Periptychus, it is apparent that it closely resembles other medium-sized Paleocene mammals, given their array of shared ‘primitive’ characteristics compared to the vast range of morphologies and adaptations exhibited by extant mammals. Consequently, the task of distinguishing between ‘primitive’ Paleocene mammals gets distorted by our bias from observing features in extant mammals, which often serve to define what a constitutes an animal adapted for a certain lifestyle. The skeleton of Periptychus bears numerous resemblances to the other Paleocene taxa observed during the course of this study; however, there are subtle distinctions between the Paleocene taxa indicative of adaptations that are not easily comparable to extant mammals. This suggests that, far from being just a generalised ancestral stock for extant orders, Paleocene mammals were experimenting with their own unique morphologies.To this end, how can we describe Periptychus? In the broadest sense, it is a medium-sized obligate terrestrial generalist, albeit a versatile one, adept at moving through and over obstacles on the forest floor with adaptations of the limbs which do not preclude some scansorial and fossorial ability, and a simple but effectively modified dentition adapted to a plant-based durophagus diet (Fig 47). During this study, we studied numerous other medium-sized Paleocene mammals and could not help postulating on their paleobiology, albeit not to the same depth as Periptychus. In relation to Periptychus, Ectoconus, a considerably larger (~100Kg body mass) appears to be more fossorially adapted with dental adaptations indicative of an herbivorous diet. Arctocyon was likely more scansorial with dental adaptations towards an omnivorous to carnivorous diet [52]. Pantolambda exhibits some traits which suggest it to be more fossorially adapted than Periptychus but not to the same degree as Ectoconus, but it also lacks several key fossorial adaptions (no indication of a fossorially adapted triceps, and relatively reduced manual elements). Further more detailed study is required, but during the course of study our observations of Pantolambda have led us to hypothesise it might have been semi-aquatic, an ecology which has also been inferred for some larger, Eocene pantodont species [3].\n10.1371/journal.pone.0200132.g047\nFig 47\n\nSkeletal reconstruction of Periptychus carinidens.\n\n\nFrom a wider perspective, the anatomy of Periptychus is broadly concurrent with what has been inferred as representative as the primitive eutherian condition. The dentition retains a primitive formula, occlusal pattern and cusp configuration albeit with numerous, modifications, but these are simple in their alteration and easily discerned. The skull is largely like other contemporaneous Paleogene taxa, although more robust in construction. The basicranial anatomy provides some interesting information, with Periptychus exhibiting a petrosal that is generally comparable the anatomy observed in taxa such as Pantolambda, Deltatherium and Eoconodon, but is somewhat divergent from the morphology exhibited by Protungulatum and Arctocyon, potentially suggesting a deeper division between periptychids and ‘arctocyonids’ than has previously hypothesised (see [3,6,9]).Throughout its evolutionary history Periptychus was apparently a highly successful taxon as evidenced by its abundant dental fossil record, and was one of the few periptychids to persist through the Torrejonian and into the Tiffanian. Consider also, that while periptychids were abundant during the Puercan, they spent most of their evolutionary history exhibiting high turnover rates, which makes the persistence and widespread abundance of Periptychus even more notable. Consequently, Periptychus–and to a broader extent, periptychids–are prime exemplars by which to tackle the taxonomic and systematic conundrum that is ‘Condylarthra’.']"

Remote sensing tools provide the opportunity to predict plant biomass and to study plant phenology in remote areas such as the Arctic, where it is difficult to collect plant data on a large spatial and temporal scale. In addition, by applying GWI (a metric derived from the NDVI time series) as a remote sensing tool to determine accurately the timing of high quality vegetation for herbivores (i.e. the date at which GWI reaches 50% of its maximum value), we were able to investigate how the geese from the three populations made use of the green wave during the three years studied. Remote sensing data, and NDVI in particular, are among the technological advances that are proving useful in studying large-scale movement ecology, and they have helped us gain a better understanding of how vegetation dynamics and distribution affect movement patterns in animal populations. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the migration of individual avian herbivores has been successfully studied with respect to vegetation phenology by using the satellite-derived green wave index.']"
2019-09-05T00:00:00Z,Resource partitioning among brachiopods and bivalves at ancient hydrocarbon seeps: A hypothesis,"['The diversity patterns of brachiopods and chemosymbiotic bivalves at seeps through the Phanerozoic indicate an interesting combination of evolutionary trajectories. The diversity of infaunal chemosymbiotic bivalves at seeps mirrors their diversity in shallow-marine environments, whereas epifaunal and semi-infaunal chemosymbiotic bivalves are unique to vent and seep ecosystems and are not found in shallow water. Brachiopod diversity at seeps is unlike the global shallow-marine trend, is unrelated to the diversity of seep-dwelling bivalves, and instead indicates long-term coexistence of the two clades. Therefore, bivalves and brachiopods have probably not been competing for the same resources but instead partitioned the food sources resulting from the two most common categories of geofuels in seepage fluids: (i) hydrogen sulfide and (ii) methane and oil-derived components. Chemosymbiotic bivalves mostly relied on sulfide-oxidizing symbionts for nutrition, for the brachiopods bacterial aerobic oxidation of methane and of other hydrocarbons played a more prominent role. The distribution and availability of hydrogen sulfide and methane at seeps is governed by geochemical gradients and ocean chemistry, which in turn should ultimately have controlled whether bivalves or brachiopods dominated hydrocarbon seeps, both in space and through geologic time.']"

Although the PA may be perceived as a reward for engagement in classroom learning, overall it appears that intervention participation has some degree of internal motivation [27], and it is reasonable to conclude that children might as a result be more receptive to programme messages than if they lacked personal control over their participation. The main benefits of the interventions were perceived to be improvements in knowledge, confidence/self-esteem, teamwork and–for the fitness and nutrition programme in particular–physical wellbeing, but no information currently exists for long-term outcomes and further investigation is recommended.On the whole, the current data indicate that the interventions were valued by stakeholders. Some suggestions were however offered for development of the programmes, including the addition of follow-up sessions and activities to be completed with parents, helping to support children’s outcomes through reinforcement of intervention messages over longer periods and in the home environment.']"
2016-06-01T00:00:00Z,An Analysis of Water Collection Labor among Women and Children in 24 Sub-Saharan African Countries,"['There is a critical need to reduce the amount of time that women and children spend collecting water. We suggest that accessibility to water, water collection by children, and gender ratios for water collection, especially when collection times are great, should be considered as key indicators for measuring progress in the water, sanitation, and hygiene sector. More work, however, is needed in order to test and potentially improve the validity of questions. For example, the number of trips a household makes per day should be added to national survey instruments to better determine water collection labor.Longitudinal research studies would be useful to better characterize how improving access to water infrastructure affects households’ opportunity costs, as well as nutritional outcomes and other health outcomes, including road casualties and assaults. Due to the limited research on water transport, current assessments made in the global burden of disease report do not include this as a risk factor in their analysis. If major investments are not made to address water collection labor, the problem could be heightened over time due to the increasing number of people predicted to live in areas with serious water shortages, many of whom are in sub-Saharan Africa.']"

The functional annotation of the DE genes suggests a large cell turnover and organization of the intestinal tissues. In concordance with their biological function, nutrient metabolism was enriched in duodenum and jejunum, whereas enteric innate immune pathways were overrepresented in ileal Peyer's patches compared to the epithelium of intestinal segments. The results provide an expression map of different small intestinal tissues in healthy animals and improve our understanding of covariation between site-specific gene expression and site-specific functionalities along the small intestinal tract. These data collected on healthy animals could be of high value to study the alteration of the gene expression profile during inflammation and/or in infectious processes in pig intestine, as well as modifications associated with nutritional events, metabolic processes or genetic selection approaches. Therefore, the new challenge would be to identify gene expression patterns, but also potential gene biomarkers in the different intestinal segments that are significantly associated with performance, health or disease resistance. Additional studies will be necessary to ascertain dynamic changes occurring over time.""]"

Aellen as reaction to mild salinity","['In our study mild stress promoted content of secondary metabolites partly after a few hours, partly after several days. But in all cases the biomass reduction in plants grown in mild stress exceeded the increase in metabolite concentration in mildly stressed plants resulting in an equal or even lower yield of metabolites per cultivated area. Therefore, the total amount of secondary metabolites per harvest was lower in the stressed plants, except for proline. There might be other individual metabolites affected in the same way. So far, total (poly)phenol concentrations were taken into consideration, but analyzing individual valuable phenolic compounds is a promising future approach because single components might react to salinity. Salinity-affected soils occur all over the world. These lands are not suitable for conventional agriculture, but for saline agriculture. Species that can be grown in these environments are halophytes. It was shown that it is possible to manipulate their antioxidant concentration and enhance their value. As salt affected areas are a general problem already, halophytes can be grown on saline areas where glycophytic crops do not survive. Alternatively, halophytes could be cultivated in hydroponic greenhouse conditions by using brackish water to enhance their nutritional value.']"

Liberibacter asiaticus’ Infection,"['This study showed that Las infection resulted in a down-regulation of photosynthesis-related proteins but an up-regulation of granule-bound starch synthase accompanied by a 6% increase (P > 0.05) in K concentration of lemon plants. All of which is consistent with reports from prior studies and might be part of a consensus pattern of biochemical response of citrus plants to Las infection. Additionally, the study identified potential intra-species specific responses of citrus to Las, particularly an observation that Las-infection facilitates a down-regulation of defense-related proteins accompanied by a 128% increase in Zn concentration in lemon plants. An interesting find that might provide information on the potential biochemical mechanisms associated with the Las-induced responses in lemon plants, which have been previously shown to display a significant level of tolerance to Las. Thus, the information provided in this study has shed more light on the molecular and physiological mechanisms involved in host response to HLB, which could be applicable towards (i) development of citrus plants with reduced susceptibility to Las, (ii) development of more efficient nutritional management programs to control the disease, (iii) a broader understanding of plant-microbe interactions.']"

Findings will inform the design of future studies seeking to understand the mechanisms of changes in taste perception during chemotherapy, and ultimately, the design of interventions aimed at reducing the negative nutritional consequences of chemotherapy treatment. Understanding more about sensory risk factors for weight gain in breast cancer groups should be prioritised in future clinical research, given the link between obesity and poorer outcomes in this population.\nImplementation of findings into practice\nPatients do not systematically receive specific information regarding the possible nature, timing of onset and duration of taste problems by health professionals, nor are possible consequences of changes or management strategies routinely discussed.

2014-10-23T00:00:00Z,Soil Chemical Property Changes in Eggplant/Garlic Relay Intercropping Systems under Continuous Cropping,"['Conclusions are drawn from the study that the patterns of eggplant relay intercropping with normal garlic or green garlic can increase soil enzyme activities and available nutrient content and change soil pH, thus improve soil quality and ecological environment. They are expected to help overcome soil sickness and continuous cropping obstacles. It certainly suggests that relay intercropping eggplant with garlic represents a potentially important contribution to meet challenge to sustainable increase the supply of vegetables in China.Furthermore, it is a reasonable hypothesis that enhanced soil fertility is related to microbial community functions, thus contributing to increased crop growth and yield of the two relay intercropping crops. Clearly, further work is needed to test the microbial community in soil and to elucidate relationships among the soil microorganism, enzyme activity, nutrition, and crop growth and yield. Besides, soil sickness is a result of long term continuous cropping. Longer study periods and larger study plots will help get more convincing results. However, in order to approach local actual vegetable production practice, natural greenhouse environment and field technique used by local farmers need to be kept.']"
2016-01-08T00:00:00Z,Social Factors Influencing Child Health in Ghana,"['The available evidence shows that the major determinants of health that affect child health in Ghana include maternal education, rural-urban disparities (place of residence), family income levels (wealth/poverty) and high dependency. An intriguing aspect of these social determinants is that they appear to be important for various kinds of diseases, ranging from obesity to autism. However, in Ghana, these social determinants are reported to be heavily linked to child mortality, nutritional status of children, completion of immunisation programmes, health seeking behaviour and hygienic practices. Although evidence on the influence of social determinants on the health of children has been documented over one and halif decades ago and some policies have been introduced to address these determinants, more policy changes and better implementation strategies are required. In designing a strategy to address this problem, stakeholders would have to recognise that social determinants are usually clustered into multiple interacting factors. We propose that developing a national child health policy agenda which supports families via both direct and indirect approaches would be crucial in addressing social determinants of health inequalities and improving child health outcomes in the country.']"
2015-08-17T00:00:00Z,Maternal Determinants of Birth Weight in Northern Ghana,"['On the whole, pre-pregnancy BMI and GWG were found to be the most important determinants of birth weight after controlling for gestational age. In most developing countries especially in Sub-Saharan African countries, counseling on appropriate weight gain in pregnancy during antenatal clinics and optimal nutrition before pregnancy for prospective mothers are mostly ignored. Since GWG is a modifiable risk factor, and recommendations exist for different BMI groups, it is important that emphasis should be placed on counseling and assisting pregnant women to stay within the recommended GWG range.Discussions about weight gain are especially important since approximately half of the mothers in this study had low GWG, which is associated with high risk of low birth weight. Beside this, a significant number of the women also had GWG above the recommended ranges and this is also considered to be a risk factor for macrosomic birth. A significant proportion of the pregnant women were over-nourished, which is a clear sign of the double burden of malnutrition currently experienced by developing and transition countries. Our findings especially on weight gain during pregnancy call for more research on factors that influence weight gain during pregnancy in Ghana.']"

Amikacin has been proven effective in disseminated infections or cases resistant to previous therapy. Renal and auditory evaluations are essential. Carbapenems are useful in some disseminated infections. Amoxacillin-clavunate can be used in some cases and during pregnancy.Most patients with eumycetoma are treated with either ketoconazole or itraconazole. Itraconazole 200–400 mg daily for 6 months is used to create a good fibrous capsule around the lesion, followed by wide local excision, continuing itraconazole 200–400 mg daily until cure is achieved. Cure is defined by the disappearance of the mass and all sinuses, normal ultrasound, and negative mycology findings. The decision to stop therapy is determined by complete sinus healing, disappearance of the eumycetoma mass clinically and radiologically by CT scan or MRI, and absence of the infecting agent. Other antifungal agents that can be used as second-line treatment include voriconazole and posaconazole.""]"

Context specific intervention strategies identified through formative research guided by Social Ecological Model and systematic development of the intervention guided by PRECEDE-PROCEED model, enabled significant net reduction in fat, sugar and salt intake, and significant net increase in fruit and vegetable intake in the intervention group. Availability of fruits and vegetables in the study area was one of the facilitating factors for improving the intake. The intervention was also successful in reducing weight, maintaining systolic blood pressure, reducing diastolic blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, and triglycerides. Overall, the study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of IT-enabled nutrition education intervention among urban population. The study indicated that it is possible to integrate efforts on changing multiple behaviours rather than focussing on single behaviour change. However, the effectiveness of this comprehensive intervention package, tested in a controlled setting, needs to be further explored through implementation research before its potential scale up.']"
2018-05-03T00:00:00Z,Impact of silencing hepatic SREBP-1 on insulin signaling,"['SREBP-1 is a transcription factor that controls important aspects of hepatic function, including carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, in response to insulin [15, 17, 18]. SREBP-1 positively correlates with mTOR activity, and both are upregulated in animal models of type 2 diabetes and in cancer [11, 40, 55–59]. The existing evidence that SREBP-1 controls expression of molecules in the insulin signaling pathway, including IRS2 and PIK3R3 [20, 21], suggests that feedback mechanisms exist between SREBP-1 and this pathway. Our data indicates that SREBP-1 activity is dispensable for normal insulin signal transduction under fed conditions. Depleting SREBP-1 in the fasted state results in a modest decrease in insulin signaling, without influencing mTOR activity. Even though the specific molecular event/s leading to this decrease remain to be determined, it is possible that they are linked to a reduction in metabolites generated in the de novo lipogenesis pathway. The presence of these metabolites in the diet and/or the higher level of insulin during the fed state are sufficient to maintain normal signal transduction levels. Overall, the contribution of SREBP-1 to sustain insulin signaling is modest.']"
2014-08-14T00:00:00Z,"The Influence of Body Mass Index, Age and Sex on Inflammatory Disease Risk in Semi-Captive Chimpanzees","['Our results support the observation that ageing and obesity are accompanied by chronic low-grade inflammatory state because higher values of platelet microparticles, neutrophils and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio -known biomarkers of inflammation in humans- were generally higher in older and higher BMI individuals [18], [99], [103], [104]. Additionally, there was a positive sex by age interaction on inflammation risk, with older males more at risk than older females. These results suggest that in chimpanzees like in humans, there exist a strong link between disease risk and age, sex and BMI.The positive relationship we found between BMI and inflammatory disease risk in chimpanzees suggests that the management of BMI in captive chimpanzees is critical to their health, welfare and longevity as demonstrated by studies on calorie restriction in other primates [105]–[109]. Management should combine husbandry practices that enhance play and exercise and design diet regimes that reduce obesity and maintain normal BMI levels. Currently, there is no characterization of BMI values considered normal or obese for management of the health of chimpanzees in captivity. Markers for inflammation risk assessed in this study will be combined with health history records to designate acceptable BMI records in future studies of this population.']"
2019-04-11T00:00:00Z,The concept of exposure when selecting comparison groups for determining individual susceptibility to addiction to cigarette smoking,"['In this study, no associations were found between OPRM1 and smoking, but when added to the analysis, mental illness and oral clinical data, significant associations were found. Our data show that the comparison group matters depending on the oral health outcome being measured. Tooth loss risk increases in the presence of OPRM1 genetic variation if one smokes at any frequency. Impact of OPRM1 in dental caries or periodontitis risk when someone smokes appears to depend of other factors that were not measured. The counterintuitive results for dental caries and periodontitis in these analyses may suggest that the effect of smoking in these diseases may be the consequence of dietary or microbiological changes that happen when someone stops smoking. We did not have diet or microbiome data to consider for these analyses and suggest that these kinds of data should be always incorporated in the future. Another limitation of this study is that the data collection was performed by different students / teachers, as it was carried out for several years. Because we work with secondary data from this database, we cannot prevent this. We also suggest that multiple comparison groups comprised by individuals that never smoked and individuals that smoked at one point and stopped should be utilized.']"

MHO had a greater ability to adapt to the caloric challenge compared to their MUO counterparts, thereby highlighting their preserved insulin sensitivity. The targeted metabolomic and FA profiling approaches revealed that several metabolites differed significantly after the challenge. Additionally, we identified metabolites at baseline that should be further studied for their potential to predict an individual’s postprandial response and cardiometabolic risk, independent of BMI. Indeed, the positive correlations seen between fasting levels of isoleucine and both fasting insulin levels and insulin AUC, as well as the positive associations seen between leucine and both HOMA-IR and fasting insulin, show the high potential of BCAA to identify “at risk” obese individuals. Further, the fasting levels of 14:0, 16:0, and 18:0 show promise as distinct markers of fasting and/or postprandial insulin sensitivity. This highlights the added value of postprandial measurements and underscores the importance to identify “at risk” obese individuals that could benefit from tailored diet interventions.']"

Molecular docking revealed that natural compounds such as gingerenone A, gingerenone B, gingerenone C, quercetin, lariciresinol and calebin A from spices exhibited much better binding score and binding energy than commercially available drugs. MD simulations were performed to study how protein-ligand interactions evolved on a temporal scale. At the end of 100 ns simulations, rescoring of the protein-ligand interactions produced an improvement in the docking score due to novel interactions with proteins and water molecules. Thus, MD simulations could be an effective tool for refining protein-ligand interactions and obtaining a more accurate indication of the dynamic evolution of the binding site interactions. Molecular interactions and pharmacokinetic properties of these compounds are extremely favourable for developing new therapeutic strategies. Further in vitro and in vivo experimental studies are being considered for the validation of the results. Thus, this study sheds light on a mechanism through which these spices may have a positive effect for diabetics. The results further our understanding about how these natural molecules, present in our diet, may interact with proteins in our body.']"

This study investigated 137Cs transfer in forest insect communities in areas contaminated by the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant Accident. The results showed that 137Cs activity concentrations were lowest in herbivores and highest in carnivores, detritivores, and omnivores. The level of contamination in each of the four functional feeding groups of insects reflected the level of contamination of the materials and organisms that constitute their diets. Detritorivorous species had the highest levels of contamination, confirming findings of previous studies that these species play a significant role in 137Cs transfer into the forest ecosystem via consumption of highly contaminated forest litter. The nonuniform distribution of 137Cs in the forest environment is not only because of litter but also because of other forest components that may have high levels of 137Cs contamination, including fungi, decaying wood, bryophytes, and lichens. Insect species that have high CR values or that live in highly contaminated substrates, such as dung beetles, camel crickets, and lichen moths, would be appropriate species for monitoring radiocesium activity concentrations or for studies of radiation effects on wildlife.']"

For pocket mice, this increased level of detection has the potential to improve our knowledge of their ecology, habitat suitability and occupancy trends across their range. In addition, our protocols should be considered by researchers attempting to assess community and ecosystem dynamics. Failure to detect some members of the community may yield incorrect estimates of community composition, species richness and interactions, niche size and overlap, as well as energy flow in ecosystems [65,66]. For example, whole community energy consumption will be relatively constant when the abundance of competing species alternate [66]. The effects of low detection of one of these interacting species, even when they are at high densities (as would be the case for pocket mice trapped with peanut butter and Sherman traps), could result in miscalculation of whole community energy consumption. In turn, failure to properly describe community interactions will reduce the credibility of management decisions for species and ecosystems in the face of a rapidly changing environment.']"

Whereas the whole body fatty acid composition was rather affected by the combination of dietary fish oil level and temperature, the liver and fillet tissue fatty acid composition was affected by the combination of all three factors (dietary fish oil level, dietary genistein, temperature). Furthermore, the dietary fish oil level and thus the varying dietary fatty acid compositions were of importance for the response of the tissues towards genistein. The temperature most likely had an overall effect on sea bream via altered growth rates and fatty acid metabolism. It can be concluded that although the effects of genistein on the fatty acid composition of sea bream were only marginal, the three-factorial approach was proven useful to improve fillet and liver fatty acid composition. It would be highly interesting to deepen the investigations on a molecular level, especially in order to highlight the combined effects of dietary fish oil and genistein on the genetic ability of sea bream to perform fatty acid synthesis.']"

We have identified that there is a wide variation in intensity of research effort at both Family and Species levels, with some of the least studied being those which may need protection in future. Rather than being driven by other characteristics including extinction risk, Carnivore research appears to be driven by their body size, range size and to some extent diet. Some of our findings hint at the complex role of human perspectives and the need to manage human-Carnivore relationships in setting research agendas. Our findings could be combined with other resources to prioritise and co-ordinate future research effort and resources.More generally, our work demonstrates another combination of literature-search- based bibliometric analysis with specialist knowledge to quantify and interpret knowledge gap findings.

Although the source of environmental resistance is unclear, we found different resistance phenotypes and genotypes in each location type, which suggests that the exposure differs between location types. Because raccoons have large home ranges, AMR detected in their feces most likely represent resistance found in the environment on a larger scale than environmental samples collected in areas where they were trapped. Raccoons can be used as sentinels for detecting environmental AMR. However, our results strongly suggest that caution should be used when categorically classifying location types in AMR studies as being natural if there is any level of human use in the area, in particular for environmental and wildlife samples. For wildlife species with larger home-ranges, such as raccoons, future studies simultaneously radio-collaring individual animals and/or analyzing diet are needed to better understand exposure in relation to carriage of antimicrobial resistant bacteria.']"
2007-04-27T00:00:00Z,Dietary Restriction in Drosophila: Delayed Aging or Experimental Artefact?,"['Despite many years of work, the mechanisms that underlie the effect of DR on lifespan remain unknown. Although historically much of the work has been performed with rodents, large-scale lifespan experiments under many conditions and genetic analysis are better suited to shorter-lived, and more easily housed, model organisms such as the invertebrates. However, if work in invertebrates is to be of any relevance to the study of aging in higher organisms, it is important to establish techniques that eliminate the confounding effects of nonaging-related causes of death, such as food toxicity and altered sexual activity. Only then can the mechanistic relationship between diet and death be established, providing modes of action to be tested in the longer-lived models. To test whether the mechanisms of DR are likely to be conserved from flies to mice, it will be interesting to see if Drosophila of different inbred lines or disease models respond to DR in a manner similar to their rodent counterparts. These studies are likely to be further refined by dietary interventions that focus on altering specific nutrients and on discovering mutations that block or alter the response to DR. What is exciting about studying DR in Drosophila is that each of the tools to perform these investigations are currently available or within close reach, meaning that characterisation of DR in Drosophila is likely to continue to be a fertile ground for research.']"

The gastrointestinal tract is inhabited by approximately 100 trillion bacteria of 500 species or more that maintain symbiotic relationships [49, 50]. When the intestinal bacterial flora is disturbed by diet, stress, and so on, and the number of detrimental bacteria increases, it is connected to a decrease in the number of probiotic bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which have protective effects on the intestinal mucosa [51]. This study is the first to demonstrate experimentally the exacerbation of pathosis in vivo using a single bacterial strain in a mouse model of UC. In addition, we were able to discover a pathogenic bacterium from the class Clostridia, which is generally known as a group of bacteria contributing to the maintenance of health. We could not induce mouse colitis by administering only a P. bifermentans PAGU1678 bacterial suspension. This suggests that colitis is the result of the combined action of damage to the mouse intestinal mucosa layer by DSS and the induction of the inflammatory response by the invasion of this tissue by P. bifermentans PAGU1678. In other words, it is possible that P. bifermentans PAGU1678 is involved in colitis as a pathosis-exacerbating factor. By comparing the components involved in the immune response induced by P. bifermentans (formally known as C. bifermentans) and C. butyricum, pathosis-exacerbating factors could be determined.']"

We have demonstrated that harboring a specific PPARD genotype may be associated with different post-training changes of measured biochemical parameters. From the haplotype analysis, we can confirm the hypothesis that being a carrier of the G/C/T haplotype is unfavorable for achieving the desired training-induced body mass measurement changes. Furthermore, our results also suggest that some individuals may benefit from carrying the G/C/C haplotype, as regards the post-training FFM changes and lowering of Chol levels. One of the major aims of exercise genomics is to finally be able to define molecular markers, which by themselves or in combination with other biomarkers would make it possible to predict the benefits from an exercise program or a physically active lifestyle. Understanding the genetic background of physiological processes would have an enormous impact not only on individualization of exercise programs to be more efficient and safer, but would also better contribute to recovery, traumatology, medical care, diet, supplementation, and many other areas [36].']"
2018-05-24T00:00:00Z,Benefits of biodiverse marine resources to child nutrition in differing developmental contexts in Hispaniola,"['The combination of remotely sensed data with household-level DHS surveys has provided an island-wide picture of the relative benefits of marine resources in differing development contexts. While coastal communities had better childhood outcomes than some inland communities in Haiti, coastal proximity was not associated with improved outcomes in the Dominican Republic. We propose an additive conceptual model in which market distribution distance from the coastline determines the trends in child nutrition. Patterns of fish consumption support this model. The observed transition in the effects of proximity to natural resources with development partially supports Myers and colleagues [25] model in which the [rural] poor lag behind. However, even though coastal Dominican children lagged behind their inland counterparts, they still had improved outcomes compared to Haitian children. If other Caribbean countries serve as indicators, as development continues, fishing communities may continue to be buoyed up and escape poor and vulnerable conditions [70]. The role of biodiversity in mediating these trends remains unclear. Datasets of marine biodiversity at the scale of the DHS surveys will be needed to truly address this question. Currently, our insights are limited by incomplete and coarse data or the use of proxies.The research performed complies with the current laws of the country in which they were performed.']"
2016-02-19T00:00:00Z,Leaf Dynamics of Panicum maximum under Future Climatic Changes,"['Several levels of organization related to leaves will significantly affect P. maximum under future climatic change, at least in winter. Elevated temperatures and CO2, or their combination, will alter leaf morphology, development, phenology, and autotrophic/heterotrophic biomass partitioning. Leaf area-mass relationships will become linear as temperatures rise or develop a clear hyperbolic relationship with a limit below 3.0 g of dry matter per tiller under elevated CO2. With sufficient water and nutrients, elevated winter temperatures will result in higher leaf expansion and appearance rates. More green leaves and a higher leaf area and biomass per tiller will occur with rising temperatures if P. maximum grows free of drought and nutritional stresses in winter. Contrastingly, when combined with elevated temperatures, elevated CO2 will inhibit foliage formation by favoring biomass partitioning to stems or by speeding up leaf maturation. Despite the CO2-temperature synergism, elevated temperatures can partially offset the inhibitory effects of CO2 on leaf development and biomass partitioning, leading to a higher foliage area and biomass than in current atmospheric conditions. The significant changes in the mass-area relationship and nitrogen concentration in leaves under elevated CO2 will very likely alter, respectively, the leaf palatability and leaf functioning of P. maximum.']"

Both F. mosseae and R. intraradices inoculations could decrease Pb root-to-leaf translocation and thus protect the aerial parts of plants from damage. Additionally, AMF increased not only growth but alsophotosynthetic pigment content, leaf photosynthesis, and antioxidant enzyme activities of R. pseudoacacia, suggesting that AMF symbiosis could help host plant to cope with Pb toxicity. The lower H2O2 and MDA contents are associated with the protection of the photosynthetic apparatus of the mycorrhizal plants could be also observed in the current study (Fig 5). A model summarizing the roles of AMF inoculation in plant tolerance to Pb is presented in Fig 6. The effects of AMF symbiosis on physiological changes of plant aerial parts likely to be the results of different nutritional status, the alteration of hormonal balance and/or secondary metabolism, and the translocation of small signaling molecules [80], which needs to be further investigated. In addition, further studies are still required to reveal the interactions between AMF and indigenous soil microorganisms in phytostabilization and ecological stability in larger scales and under more complex environmental conditions.']"
2016-04-21T00:00:00Z,Children with Moderate Acute Malnutrition with No Access to Supplementary Feeding Programmes Experience High Rates of Deterioration and No Improvement: Results from a Prospective Cohort Study in Rural Ethiopia,"['Our results indicate that children with MAM during the post-harvest season in an area with no access to SFPs experience an unacceptably high incidence of SAM and a low recovery rate. This highlights the need to re-assess the current strategy for addressing MAM in these areas. The results suggest that the current approach of not having a targeted nutrition specific intervention to address MAM in this context place children with MAM at excessive risk of adverse outcomes. As the study was implemented during the best period for food security, we were not expecting such a high rate of deterioration and assumed that there would be sufficient food in households to ensure recovery from MAM, yet for close to half of these children this recovery did not happen. It is likely that if the study had been implemented during the hunger period, the rate of deterioration to SAM would have been even higher, with a concomitant increase in mortality. It is concerning to learn that such a high proportion of children with MAM will enter the next hunger season in such a vulnerable condition, with likely consequences of increased risk of SAM and death. Additional preventive and curative approaches should urgently be considered, particularly aimed at children with low MUAC, taking into account feasibility within the resource constraints of middle and low-income public health programming.']"
2019-07-16T00:00:00Z,Linking forest management to moose population trends: The role of the nutritional landscape,"['Our results indicate that variation in quantity of forage for moose across northern Idaho is likely correlated with moose population trends. These correlations indicate that forage might play an important role in limiting moose populations and contributing to population declines in our study region. Research linking forage conditions with foraging behavior, nutritional condition and fitness of individuals is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underpinning these relationships [12]. We recommend that future research on moose populations include consideration of the foraging landscape and its potential interaction with other population drivers. Failing to do so could result in misidentification of proximate population drivers as ultimate factors, and consequently, management actions that do not produce expected results. In addition, the relative importance of different population drivers, including forage limitation, predation, or climatic factors, is likely to change across time and space, stressing the need for data collection across large spatial scales and long timeframes. Our study highlights the importance of assessing how changes in land management across broad spatiotemporal extents affect wildlife and their habitats. This knowledge can be used in forest management to assess and prescribe disturbances (e.g., timber harvest and forest fires) required to maintain productive wildlife populations.']"
2015-09-22T00:00:00Z,Genetic Divergence and Heritability of 42 Coloured Upland Rice Genotypes (Oryzasativa) as Revealed by Microsatellites Marker and Agro-Morphological Traits,"['Cluster analysis from the SSR markers grouped all the genotypes into 7 groups according to geographical origin and status of the cultivar. All agro-morphological data showed significant differences at p≤0.05 and p≤0.01 for all traits which shows the presence of diversification among the 42 coloured upland rice genotypes. Four groups were constructed using agro-morphological data clustering analysis. Yield contribution factors traits, which are yield per plant and harvest index, showed the highest value of heritability and genetic advance. Selection based on these traits can be done for further breeding programmes. Potential genotypes such as C, Chirikata 2, Ble Chu Cau, and IR 9669-PP 836–1, are recommended for selection and further evaluation in future breeding programmes. This is based on their molecular and agro-morphological information. These genotypes, selected from groups 2, 3, 4 and 5 from the SSR primer grouping, also have high grain per yield and harvest index values. For further studies, the evaluation of nutritional value of coloured upland rice can be done since red and purple bran may contain many phytochemical and neutraceutical functional foods. Thus, it will give high impact on rice breeding programme for development high yield and functional rice.']"

The hidden hunger indices and maps illustrate both the burden of multiple micronutrient deficiencies and their contribution to the disease burden. They also provide a useful tool for advocates to illustrate the real need for multiple micronutrient interventions to address hidden hunger. In addition, they provide useful information for policy makers in decision making and prioritizing interventions, and offer valuable information for public health scientists as a basis for action, and the subsequent monitoring and evaluation of preventive programs.Of the 20 countries with the highest HHI-PD scores, 18 were in sub-Saharan Africa and two were in Asia. Stunting, iron deficiency anemia, and vitamin A deficiency were highly prevalent amongst preschool children in countries with the highest HHI-PD. The hidden hunger indices provide evidence for the appropriate targeting and prioritizing of comprehensive and inclusive nutrition programs which address global hidden hunger. The HHI-PD and maps also provide valuable information on hot spots where the prevalence of hidden hunger is alarmingly high, and where focused and scaled-up interventions are most critical to the attainment of the MDGs.']"

Tolerance was unaffected by the soil nitrogen status after two years of simulation. Because birch leaf production is highly plastic and exhibit compensation at moderate browsing pressure, it could provide a reliable forage resource for caribou. We still have to demonstrate whether higher leaf biomass translates into higher forage availability and what effect browsing has on forage nutritive quality. Lower forage availability could occur even under full compensation if the structure of the shrubs is modified. We also demonstrated the usefulness of the LRM, when assumptions are met, and we integrated the effect of browsing pressure in our predictions. On the other hand, we tested only one focal resource but birches could also be limited by water availability. Although B. glandulosa seems tolerant to periodic droughts, xeric drainage can be detrimental to the species [59]. Our results showed that caribou can decrease birch leaf biomass, thus with recent declines in caribou populations worldwide [64] the subsequent decline in browsing pressure could benefit the current shrub expansion [1].']"
2013-10-18T00:00:00Z,Diverse Microbiota Identified in Whole Intact Nest Chambers of the Red Mason Bee Osmia bicornis (Linnaeus 1758),"['From a microbial perspective, Osmia females create brood cell microhabitats that resemble to a large part the surrounding environmental characteristics due to passive transport of bacteria from various sources into these nests. In contrast to plant-associated bacteria, those of soils seem to be able to flourish and dwell within the compartment walls between nest chambers. The resulting community is very diverse and may be composed of a patchwork from different collection sites. They may further be highly variable according to differences in soil characteristics of the bioregion and individual bee collection behavior.From a bee perspective, the brood cell environment is very different from the controlled microbial system inhabited by honey bee colonies. This diversity of microorganisms may cause severe larval mortality and require specific physiological or symbiotic adaptations against microbial threats. They may however also profit from such a diverse environment through gain of mutualistic partners. These microbiological conditions require further attention as they are likely of great importance in bee offspring nutrition, development, and immune-response to multiple threats. We conclude that further studies of microbial interaction networks in solitary bees will help to explore so far unknown fitness components and will improve the understanding of driving factors of population dynamics.']"

E. coli O157:H7 could survive for 32.79±1.16 days in neutral soils, and only 6.5±1.34 days in acidic soils. Special attention should be paid to the different survival times of E. coli O157:H7 in acidic and neutral soils when evaluating the environmental risk associated with it. The survival of E. coli O157:H7 in soils might relate to the interactions between numerous physical, chemical and biological factors. Our findings suggested that high soil pH and organic carbon could prolong E. coli O157:H7 survival times (td), while the initial G−/G+ ratio and exchangeable K were negatively correlated with survival times. Soil pH governs the fate of E. coli O157:H7 directly and indirectly through the adsorption/desorption of soil minerals, nutrition availability, and metal toxicity. However, the experiment was carried out under laboratory conditions. In order to better understand the survival dynamics of E. coli O157:H7 and provide precise information to assess the possible risk of contamination by this pathogen, further research should be done under natural conditions.']"
2014-05-28T00:00:00Z,"Lipid, Fatty Acid and Energy Density Profiles of White Sharks: Insights into the Feeding Ecology and Ecophysiology of a Complex Top Predator","['In this study we used lipid analyses to directly extract energetic and feeding related information on white sharks. We found that while the muscle is a site of structural energy, the liver has an even higher energy density than whale blubber and serves as a storage unit to fuel white shark migrations, growth and reproduction. Among-individual variation in fatty acid profiles suggest individuality in foraging strategies with some sort of a gradient between dominant or partial consumption of fish and mammals. Such information, although currently very limited in elasmobrachs, is required for the development of bioenergetics-based models including dynamic energy budget models and ecosystem models increasingly used in fisheries and conservation management. Indeed, measuring total lipid energy is appealing because lipids represent a common currency, linking food quality and quantity to many aspects of fish nutrition, reproduction and population dynamics. Future studies should include targeted sampling and utilization of this novel approach on live specimens, along with ongoing telemetry studies, to explore the relative contributions of biological and environmental factors influencing intra-specific variation. Such data will allow us to better understand the ecology of white shark and predict how they might respond to environmental perturbations.']"

The findings show that residing in households with a poor socio-economic status, drinking water from unprotected water bodies, having mothers who are HIV-positive, and being born to uneducated mothers are significant risk factors for mortality across both age groups (infant, and under-five) in rural South Africa. There is cause for hope in being able to achieve the SDG 2030 targets in South Africa, for reducing child mortality, which requires good nutrition, safe water, adequate sanitation, good hygiene, and reduced HIV infections. However, much needs to be done to further reduce mortality in these vulnerable age groups. The results highlight the need for a more comprehensive approach to child health intervention programmes towards reducing child mortality in rural SSA. Such policies need to include improvements in socio-economic status, health services, educating mothers, accessibility to clean water sources as well as improving the control of HIV and other preventable diseases. In addition, intervention policies need to embrace comprehensive child feeding guidelines and communication strategies in order to reduce under-five mortality, especially HIV-related deaths.']"
2019-10-01T00:00:00Z,Multilevel legal approaches to obesity prevention: A conceptual and methodological toolkit,"['Public health law research and scholarship continues to focus on measuring the effects of a wide range of state laws on population health [55]. Recent studies have considered the effects of everything from medical marijuana legalization to seat belt safety laws [56–58]. While these studies and previous work on obesity prevention laws often make reference to the ecological model of health behavior change, they have not systematically linked this model to the laws under investigation. Moreover, the focus is generally on a particular ecological level, such as schools. In this paper, we presented a conceptual framework that allows for the classification of obesity laws based on the ecological level of influence and the underlying legal mechanism involved. This creates the capacity to develop theory-driven models of the effects of various combinations of legal techniques and environment modification. This is an important first step in the direction of identifying legal interventions that are most likely to reduce obesity prevalence and increase health-promoting behaviors.Our classification system and search reveals that no obesity laws enacted during the study period specifically targeted the interpersonal level of influence. This is an important finding because it shows that a domain critical to shaping obesity-related behaviors and habits was not the target of substantial policy activity. Although changing dietary practices in the home is likely to be an essential component of any policy intervention that successfully reduces obesity rates over the long term, lawmakers may find it particularly challenging to develop politically feasible and socially acceptable interventions at this ecological level. Proposed amendments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) that would restrict the purchase of foods that do not meet certain nutritional standards provide an example of how a legal mechanism that decreases access to obesogenic foods might target the home environment indirectly [59]. Ultimately, efforts to quantify the effects of any current or proposed interventions must continue to evolve with a focus on linking laws to health outcomes with a solid theoretical model of health behavior change.Our findings of extensive adoption of physical activity standards, physical education standards, and walk and bike path legislation are consistent with prior studies of the state-level obesity policy landscape [60–63]. Our finding that the majority of states do not have a comprehensive package of obesity prevention laws that targets multiple ecological levels of influence on youth obesity raises important questions about how obesity policy is developed on the state level as even more recent data collection efforts reveal that multilevel legal approaches within states are rare. Several studies [61–64] have sought to identify state-level socioeconomic, political, or population health factors that shape adoption of obesity prevention laws. Political factors such as a democratically controlled legislature and a longer legislative term are both associated with increased likelihood of bill enactment. State legislative action on obesity was also more likely in states with a greater gap between adults’ actual and desired weight, a higher percentage of college-educated adults, and a higher percentage of African-American residents [65]. However, adult obesity prevalence was generally not a significant predictor of bill enactment [65].In order to create the potentially synergistic effects of multiple obesity prevention laws, state policymakers should continue to create and enact legal interventions that target different ecological levels of influence on youth obesity. Expanding opportunities for recreation through walk and bike path development is an important first step to encourage healthier lifestyle choices. However, it does not go far enough in addressing the multiple environmental determinants of obesity. There is a glaring lack of legal interventions that directly target the intrapersonal and interpersonal ecological levels; this highlights the need for laws that will change food and physical activities practices within the home and provide individuals with more opportunity to change their physical activity and food practices independently. For example, restricting the use of supplemental nutrition assistance benefits to healthy foods, providing benefits that cover the cost of using local gym facilities for families or individuals, or increasing individual access to obesity treatments through public or private insurance mechanisms are policy options that would start to fill the existing gap. Future research might examine the scope and content of the evidence base for successfully adopted obesity prevention laws in an effort to bridge the gap between obesity research and law. The absence of more comprehensive combinations of obesity prevention laws may limit the potential of legal interventions to help solve this pressing public health issue.']"
2017-08-22T00:00:00Z,A systematic review of sub-national food insecurity research in South Africa: Missed opportunities for policy insights,"[""The experience of food insecurity found in this review was characterised by issues affecting the ability of individuals and households to access sufficient food. This resonated with–and expands on—the shift in food security ‘paradigms’ narrated on in the 1990s by Maxwell, who observed that since the 1970s the focus in analysis and programming has moved from being on national production deficits to being orientated towards the consumer, at the level of household and individual livelihoods and capabilities (see [181]). These shifts have also seen the commensurate change in the way food security is measured, and how best to do so has been the subject of scholarly debate for some time [37, 182].The use of 27 different measurement tools across the 169 studies is indicative not only of the different disciplinary backgrounds of the authors but also of the difficulty in establishing an absolute ‘state' of food insecurity that is comparable across space and time. Some approaches focussed on measuring food security through a composite food access index, others on quantifying micro- and macro-nutrient intake, and still others on malnutrition outcomes such as stunting. This makes a direct comparison of relative food insecurity across the studies very difficult.A wide range of food insecurity drivers was cited across the studies, with each study reflecting local level, context-specific dynamics. Nevertheless, the very high reliance on purchased food means that being able to afford food is the predominant challenge in South Africa, with 51% of studies specifically citing poverty as a food insecurity driver. Food prices are a cause for concern and discussion. In the light of poverty, there is a high dependence on government grants, which is seen as preventing households from falling into absolute hunger, but may be a disincentive to engaging in more sustainable food security efforts, such as food gardens. This is resonant with the kinds of trade-offs involved among the food insecure, in which coping strategies frequently have short as well as long-term negative impacts on livelihood resilience.Food production is beset with access-related issues including affordability of agricultural inputs, poor access to farm and non-farm resources, and failing or exclusionary formal and informal institutions. Given these challenges, it is perhaps not surprising that deagrarianisation emerged as a theme in the studies. Deagrarianisation also takes place in the context of a rapidly urbanising world. Urban food systems were discussed by some studies.The exclusionary practices of formal and informal institutions were repeatedly raised in relation to agriculture and other aspects of food access. Access to social resources was particularly mentioned in relation to gender dynamics, which disadvantage women in myriad ways in the food security landscape.The so-called nutrition transition creates a (relatively new) dimension to food insecurity, and one that is linked to markets and food availability, food choices and nutrition, as well as food access. This transition sees a move towards the increasing consumption of cheaper, more available, and/or preferable ‘globalised’ foods, which have a high-energy content but generally low nutritional value, and which are heralding overweight and obesity alongside features of malnutrition such as stunting. However, all of the food security issues raised in the studies, are components of a food system that has multiple ailments but also multiple opportunities.A high level of local specificity in the causes, experience and consequences of food insecurity in South Africa is evident from the reviewed research. Decision-makers need to consider the local level context in developing and implementing interventions. From an operational perspective, the ‘how’ of interventions- their process- matters at least as much as their ‘what’. Misselhorn’s framework for intervention processes incorporates social capital, participation, coordination, and learning interactions as essential elements in food security interventions [183].The study highlights the need for paying more attention to what we are measuring and being precise in how food insecurity is measured. While there are no agreed on measures internationally, it is important for the food security research community and national departments entrusted with monitoring and evaluation of food security (primarily the Departments for Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation; Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries; Health; Rural Development and Land Reform and Statistics South Africa) to confer and agree on a minimum set of indicators, methodologies and the interpretation of these indicators for reporting in more consistent ways. The wealth of sub-national surveys could provide additional rich understandings of local and household level experiences of food security and informed evidence for more appropriate policy making and designing of intervention programmes. Policymakers at all spheres of government (national, provincial and municipal) should be engaging with this wealth of researchers and sub-national study findings to enrich their food security planning, monitoring, and evaluation.""]"
2018-08-09T00:00:00Z,Diabetes prevalence in rural Indigenous Guatemala: A geographic-randomized cross-sectional analysis of risk,"['Historical T2DM prevalence data in Guatemala is limited to a 1970 multi-site study yielding a 4·2% prevalence based on a glucose load test[4], a 2003 urban mestizo site study yielding 8·4% based on OGTT [6–8]. The results of this study report a 13·81% prevalence of DM in an Indigenous, rural community of Atitlán. There are numerous considerations in comparing these various data points–different populations, different sampling methods, different measuring tools (Table 2), and different definitions of diabetes (Table 1). The overall qualitative trend demonstrates a concerning increase of DM in Guatemala associated with increasing age and it may represent a health disparity in Indigenous populations.The reasons for this trend is likely multifactorial—increased sedentary lifestyles, change in diet, an aging population and perhaps an underlying genetic difference. There is, however, surprisingly no correlation with BMI. Further investigation of specific ways Guatemalan lifestyles have changed, adipose distribution, correlation with anemia, and genetic risk factors is required to understand environmental and genetic influences. While an early comparative study in 1962 looked at Guatemala and the US and diabetes [42], the findings of this study suggest further understanding is still needed more than 50 years later.']"

Reference intervals can provide important information for evaluating the health of a particular population of turtles, serve as baseline information for monitoring the impacts of various disturbances on the population, guiding management of clinical cases in the rehabilitation setting, and establishing criteria for evaluating the prognosis for release of turtles from rehabilitation centers. Clinical pathology parameters can be variable based on a variety of factors, including age, size, sex, diet, season, and concurrent disease [5,20,21,33,44,48], therefore reference intervals specific to a particular population and partitioned into subgroups based on clinically relevant differences are important for the use of hematology and biochemistry as a diagnostic and prognostic tool for assessing individual and population health. Because loggerhead sea turtles are threatened, population health assessments are valuable for conservation and management. Our study has established an important frame of reference for conservation efforts dedicated to the recovery of the distinct population segment of loggerhead sea turtles inhabiting Core Sound, North Carolina.']"

These results add compelling evidence of the urgent need to implement a systematic strategy for the reduction of dietary sodium intake at the population level in Italy.The MINISAL results also suggest that the largely inadequate levels of potassium intake recently documented in the Italian adult population [13] might have their roots in early childhood, calling for a tighter collaboration among the Italian pediatricians, the school education system and the children’s parents in the effort to reduce the gap between the current negative features of Italian dietary habits and the classical model of Mediterranean diet featuring generous consumption of natural foods such as fruits and vegetables and a watchful attitude against the current abuse of low quality high energy salt-rich foods starting in childhood.These data indicate that future campaigns, aiming at increasing the awareness about correct sodium and potassium intakes, should focus on children and adolescents as a major target in the framework of a population strategy of cardiovascular prevention.']"
2014-03-28T00:00:00Z,Potential Regulatory Role of MicroRNAs in the Development of Bovine Gastrointestinal Tract during Early Life,"['This is the first study to profile miRNA expression throughout the bovine GIT during the immediate postnatal period of dairy calves. The present study revealed temporal and regional differences in miRNA expression. Based on the predicted targets of DE miRNAs, their functions are mainly involved in mucosal immune system development in the small intestine. Some of the abundant miRNAs, temporally DE miRNAs, regionally DE miRNAs, and miRNAs which are associated with bacterial density were predicted to have functions such as gut tissue development and immune system development through the development of GIT. Significant correlations between miRNAs and the abundance of gut bacteria suggest that miRNAs may provide a mechanism to respond to microbial colonization and regulate the development of the host mucosal immune system. The extensive small RNA sequencing dataset of bovine GIT tissues generated in the present study provides baseline data for future studies on GIT development and host-microbial interactions. Further studies to correlate miRNA expression and transcriptome of the same tissue are in progress and will provide direct evidences on how miRNA and mRNA expressions are integrated to mediate host-microbial interactions. Moreover, future studies are required to determine to what extent these changes are directly influenced by factors such as microbiota, age, and diet.']"

We found relatively low concentrations of Hg and Se in fish. Fish relied on a mixture of pelagic and littoral sources for their diet, with carbon sources influencing their Hg concentration. We also found short FCLs in the reservoirs compared to some African great lakes and to the global average for lakes. Fish Hg concentrations were relatively low in the three reservoirs, which likely reflects a combination of factors: 1) low levels of MeHg in water and of THg in sediments leading to low MeHg uptake at the base of the food webs (as indicated by the low THg concentrations in detritivorous fish); 2) the low trophic position of many fish species in these systems; and 3) less efficient biomagnification of Hg in systems with shorter food chains. Selenium did not biomagnify in the reservoirs, in contrast with Hg, and as a result, Hg:Se ratios declined with increasing trophic position of fish, although always was >1, The mechanisms controlling biomagnification rates in African foodwebs remains unclear. Further research is needed to improve our understanding on Hg and Se biogeochemical cycles and the processes leading to lower bioaccumulation in African freshwater ecosystems.']"
2017-10-13T00:00:00Z,Serial-omics characterization of equine urine,"['It is important to note that the majority of global urine -omics studies have taken place from human and mouse urine samples while most horse urine studies have focused on specific targeted compounds. However, we expect that many mammals should have a somewhat similar urine profile as far as it concerns the major metabolites and proteins. However, diet also plays a crucial role as well as differences in the digestion system between horses and humans. As a result, we found a significant number of plant related metabolites due to a horse’s diet of hay and vegetation. As expected, the number of identified proteins (46) from horse mare urine was significant but far less than analyses in other biological tissues such as cells, plasma, solid tissue where thousands of proteins are the norm. The number of small molecule polar metabolites was high with 474 molecules identified. Only 10 non-polar lipid molecules were identified. These show that a single aliquot of horse urine can be used for a liquid-liquid extraction for a multi-omics analysis. We chose to perform lipidomics, proteomics and metabolomics on normal 12 year old horse mare urine. These analyses demonstrate a baseline for omics analyses from horse urine and can be used as a reference for expected future results. This technique can be applied in discovering the presence of a diseased or drug administered-horse from the norm by comparing alterations in the metabolites, lipids and proteins identified. If repeated over a time-course, these analyses can potentially be used to monitor disease progression, health status, inflammation or used to develop biomarkers for performance indicators. Not only do we expect levels of common metabolites and proteins to vary across sample conditions, but unique molecules to be identified in specific cohorts. The proteomic analysis can reveal disease-specific proteins or reveal a relative quantitative change in protein levels. The untargeted metabolomic analyses can identify illicit drug molecules or reveal metabolic changes that indicate disease. In addition, the lipidomics analysis can reveal diseases in the nephrotic system based on the number and types of lipids present. While horses urinate in several liter volumes per episode, we chose to use a very small aliquot of 333 μL in order to demonstrate that we can acquire comprehensive—omics data on small volumes of biological fluid. This can be applied to as little as a few drops of blood, saliva, tears, etc [71]. The current state of high resolution tandem mass spectrometry is extraordinarily sensitive down to sub nanogram levels [72]. These data represent the first comprehensive multi-omics report from normal and healthy horse urine and is intended to be used as a reference tri-ome for further comprehensive equine urine research.

2018-01-24T00:00:00Z,"Dental disease and dietary isotopes of individuals from St Gertrude Church cemetery, Riga, Latvia","['The main aim of this paper was to explore if there were different population groups buried in the St Gertrude’s cemetery, based on differences in the prevalence of dental pathological conditions and attrition and dietary stable isotope values.Firstly, there were differences between contexts with regard to dental attrition and calculus deposits. Although most contrasts were observed between mass graves and the GC, there was also evidence for differences between the mass graves, mainly expressed by significantly higher attrition rates in children from MG1 than in both other contexts. This evidence supports the possible presence of more than one population group in the mass graves, albeit with more similarities between them when compared to Gertrude villagers buried in the GC. The lack of significant differences in destructive dental disease between any of the groups is suggestive of a similar amount of carbohydrates in their diet.The results of the dietary stable isotope analysis, however, did not support evidence for the presence of different populations when compared by context. The individuals from all three groups were spread across the observed range for both δ13C and δ15N. The observed variability of δ13C values suggested that all groups had equal access to marine fish and/or other marine protein, but that it was accessed differentially among individuals, without clear evidence for any pattern by context and/or sex groups. Likewise, no significant differences were found in δ15N values between any groups. The low mean and individual δ13C values also suggest that the marine input in the diet of the whole population might have been too low to have any preventative effect on destructive dental disease.The three hypotheses of this study were only partly supported, because evidence for several population groups being present in the cemetery was not fully supported by all observed variables. However, as discussed above, it is possible that local populations living in close proximity to the sea, and/or inland with regular access to salted fish, might be isotopically indistinguishable. Further research is ongoing to look at strontium isotope data from selected individuals in each context, which might help to identify any migrants, and thus provide further evidence about the population groups buried in St Gertrude’s cemetery. Furthermore, aspects of general health, including indicators of interrupted growth in childhood, will also be compared between the contexts.Currently, there is a lack of similar studies from the region, hampering comparisons with other contemporary coastal and/or inland populations, especially with regard to dietary isotope values. This study is therefore an important addition to the published literature, having generated comparable and detailed data on oral health indicators, as well as a set of much needed reference dietary isotope values, which can be readily used in the future by researchers all over the Baltic region.']"
2013-12-31T00:00:00Z,siRNA Machinery in Whitefly (Bemisia tabaci),"['We observed that the siRNA machinery of whitefly showed significant sequence homology with aphids and other insects. Further, transcript abundance of each component was also significant. These results indicated the possibility of massive siRNA response in whitefly. However, the previous reports with whitefly and other insects like A. pisum with similar domain organization and expression show inconsistent siRNA response with different target genes. In earlier study we observed that feeding of equal quantity siRNA targeting different genes (actin ortholog, ADP/ATP translocase, α-tubulin, ribosomal protein L9 and V-ATPase A subunit) in whitefly showed diverse kind of responses [24]. Ribosomal protein L9 and V-ATPaseA targeting siRNA caused significant mortality of whitefly in comparison to others. In A. pisum, only transient reduction in gene expression is reported after dsRNA injection and feeding [36], [49]. However, injection of siRNAs targeting coo2 gene of aphid salivary protein showed strong systemic response in A. pisum [50]. But similar response was not observed in green peach aphid M. persicae for the same gene when delivered through transgenic plants [51]. These variations in RNAi responses might be due to the difference in importance of genes, method of delivery, different role of same gene in various insects and others so many unknown regions. Therefore, future studies regarding the insect control can target multiple genes at a time to get significant response. We have observed in our earlier experiment that the feeding of dsRNA through artificial diet offers the best option for the screening of target gene in insects [24]. Moreover, translation of such technology efficiently in the field by using transgenic plants is necessary [7], [8]. In this process we have developed the transgenic plants expressing the most effective dsRNA (V-ATPase A, which was earlier analysed by feeding in artificial diet) [24] and found similar effect [unpublished data]. Further, present study of characterization and gene expression analysis of siRNA machinery supports our earlier results and opens a new way for the presumption of insect responses towards RNAi.Sid1 has been reported from diverse groups of insects except some dipterans like Drosophila and correlated with the systemic RNAi responses [52], [53]. Further it is highly conserved among different taxa even when they are discrete from each other [18]. Lack of Sid1 in dipteran is astonishing and therefore very deep analysis is required regarding the molecular evolution of Sid1 by wide sampling of insect orders including diptera. Moreover, Luo et al [23] reported that Sid1 is not required for systemic RNAi in the migratory locust Locusta migratoria. These reports indicated that wide analysis of different insect is required to reach the base of RNAi.Systemic and vigorous RNAi response is pre-requisite for the RNAi based pest control using transgenic crops. Knowledge of siRNA machinery and their detail characterization not only explains the molecular mechanism of RNAi, but also indicates the probable response of target insects before developing the transgenic plants.']"
2016-09-26T00:00:00Z,Taxes on Sugar-Sweetened Beverages to Reduce Overweight and Obesity in Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Review,"['This review assessed nine studies, including three quasi-experimental studies, and four non-experimental, and two modeling studies. While these studies alone were insufficient to draw strong conclusions about the effectiveness of an SSB tax in improving obesity outcomes in MICs, the review indicates that a tax on SSBs may be a promising policy for MICs to consider in the face of the growing burden of overweight and obesity. A tax on SSBs will increase prices of soda, if not other SSBs, where markets are consolidated. The price increase required to prevent further growth in the prevalence of obesity and overweight varies across MICs, with most needing at least a 20% increase. The review also suggests that the tax alone will not likely lead to reductions in energy intake that are large enough to affect permanent reductions in population weight. The evidence base remains insufficient to definitively determine whether taxing SSBs will be more or less effective in MICs versus high-income countries, though it does indicate that differences will unlikely be large. MIC governments may want to consider adjusting existing surveys to create opportunities for stronger research and evaluation. They may also want to consider including type-2 diabetes as an outcome so that the indicators reflect a holistic understanding of the nutritional needs in MIC populations. They may also consider implementing the tax with other obesity prevention interventions.']"
2007-01-16T00:00:00Z,When Is Replacement Feeding Safe for Infants of HIV-Infected Women?,"[""Current research in prevention of breast-milk HIV transmission includes evaluation of a variety of approaches, including optimizing exclusive breast-feeding, providing antiretrovirals during shortened breast-feeding to mother or infant, and, ultimately, vaccination. Preserving breast-feeding is attractive because of nutritional, growth, safety, and confidentiality issues, and in the future these approaches may enable prolonged breast-feeding. However, some of the interventions currently under study may not be as promising as initially envisioned. For example, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) during shortened breast-feeding is not the panacea hoped for—it may be associated with loss of confidentiality, toxicity, resistance, and infant morbidity and growth compromise when breast-feeding is stopped at six months. It is plausible that strategizing for not breast-feeding from birth would be less problematic than first starting to breast-feed on HAART, and then stopping after six months. Thus, replacement feeding should still be considered in the mix of strategies to prevent breast-milk transmission of HIV, particularly when water safety is assured and provision of breast-milk substitutes is an option. Becquet et al's data are reassuring that when appropriate support is provided and clean water is available, replacement feeding can be safe in an urban African setting.""]"
2017-10-05T00:00:00Z,Entomopathogenic fungi-based mechanisms for improved Fe nutrition in sorghum plants grown on calcareous substrates,"['The three EPF strains used in the in vitro assay increased the Fe availability under different conditions with respect to the Fe source (three Fe oxides of different crystallinities and solubilities) and growing substrate (calcareous or non-calcareous). Metarhizium brunneum was the most effective fungus, seemingly as a result of its increase of the Fe availability by releasing organic acids to lower the pH of the calcareous media. Both B. bassiana and M. brunneum alleviated the Fe chlorosis symptoms in inoculated sorghum plants grown on an artificial calcareous substrate. Although the three inoculation methods used in this experiment had positive effects on the plants, the soil treatment was the most effective method. Thus, it resulted in the increased persistence of the fungus in the substrate (CFU), re-isolation from different plant tissues to an extent comparable to that of seed dressing, a more persistent effect on the chlorophyll concentration of young leaves and plant growth relative to the other two inoculation methods, and a similar ability to increase the Fe uptake by sorghum plants. As revealed by the root parameter values, the soil treatment also resulted in a better exploration of the substrate. Therefore, the inoculation method is a key factor to consider in designing sustainable agricultural strategies based on EPF. The results of this work expand on the existing knowledge of plant-EPF-soil relations, and they underscore the importance of the inoculation method and the use of EPF to improve plant Fe nutrition in calcareous substrates beyond their role as biocontrol agents.']"
2016-08-25T00:00:00Z,"A Look into the Cell: Honey Storage in Honey Bees, Apis mellifera","['Variation in ripening dynamics within and between individual cells might reflect the outcome of storer bees’ behavior to work around the spatial and biophysical constraints to nectar ripening. The reorganization of stores to concentrate nectar into honey and the coordination with other colony functions, such as brood rearing [37], is achieved via cell content relocation. This process led to the overall increase of filling level in a high number of storage cells, of which the content concentration eventually reached that of honey. Ripening dynamics showed intercolonial variations that might be explained by internal factors (e.g. genetics, variations in humidity within the hives [12]). In conclusion, our data provide evidence for the occurrence of both passive and active mechanisms involved in honey production and confirm previous hypotheses based on behavioural observations [5,10,11]. Given the high resolution and non-destructive property of the method used, we were also able to describe previously unknown phenomena of nectar processing and honey production at the individual cell and comb levels (e.g. within cell heterogeneity of content and their dynamics over time). A combination of diagnostic radioentomology and detailed behavioral observations under a range of natural conditions will help to further advance our understanding of the ripening and storing of honey according to the colony’s nutritional and environmental contexts and contribute to improving beekeeping management.']"
2016-11-09T00:00:00Z,Plasma Ghrelin Concentrations Were Altered with Oestrous Cycle Stage and Increasing Age in Reproductively Competent Wistar Females,"['Significant changes were detected in total ghrelin concentrations in fed and fasted plasma, but not in stomach tissue, during different stages of the oestrous cycle in Wistar rats, along with observed decreased fasted stomach contents at oestrus. Fasted plasma ghrelin concentration increases were only observed in matched fed samples when rats were transitioning from oestrus to metoestrus on consecutive days. Circulating ghrelin levels were significantly reduced by 37 weeks of age in rats in both fed and fasted conditions. The biological implications of these findings are yet to be established in reproductively active animals, but warrant further investigation into ghrelin regulatory factor changes with increasing age in reproductively competent female mammals. If replicated in humans, the response to feeding, and higher circulating concentrations of total ghrelin in younger adult females, have the potential to influence the findings and interpretation of other studies, potential drug treatments, and surgical interventions. Future studies would need to factor ovarian cycle stage and age-related ghrelin regulatory changes into their experimental design and data analyses. Likewise, with the shift towards older human mothers with potentially altered concentrations of appetite-influencing hormones, producing their first children later in life, may also affect development in utero and post-partum nutrition, thus the metabolic programming of future generations.']"
2015-01-28T00:00:00Z,Trehalose Is a Chemical Attractant in the Establishment of Coral Symbiosis,"['We have found that in the symbiotic relationship between corals and Symbiodinium, fixed carbon in the form of trehalose produced by the symbiont plays a key role in how these partners find each other. This signal may yield information about the nutritional status and potential fitness of the signal generator and may serve the critical role of attracting the partners towards one another, where further information, in direct cell-cell interactions, can then be exchanged. Given that a likely benefit of horizontal infection is the identification of symbionts best suited to a particular environment, the trehalose cue, reflecting photosynthetic capability, may be particularly important to a potential host.Symbiosis between coral and intracellular dinoflagellates is critical for coral viability and reef ecosystem productivity. Most larval coral take up symbionts from their environment; but how these symbiotic partners signal and sense one another has been unknown. To help solve this mystery, we demonstrated in F. scutaria coral and their Symbiodinium: 1) a release of the disaccharide trehalose into the environment by the symbionts, 2) a coral larval chemo-attraction and feeding response in the presence of trehalose, 3) the presence of the enzyme, trehalase, in coral tissue, but not in the symbionts, and 4) adult release of live Symbiodinium, thus seeding the reef. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a specific chemical cue attracting the motile coral larvae to the symbiont.']"
2014-10-07T00:00:00Z,New Insights into How Increases in Fertility Improve the Growth of Rice at the Seedling Stage in Red Soil Regions of Subtropical China,"['The present study investigated reasons that increasing soil fertility would enhance the growth of rice. The study adopted a new perspective focusing on rice root ROL and its corresponding soil oxygen profile. The fertile soil had high porosity (because of the low clay content) and a high NH4+ content, which supported soil nitrification. A high rhizosphere oxygen pressure distribution caused by the rice root ROL, which was attributed to the improved rice root growth and root porosity observed in the high-fertility soil, also contributed to the promotion of rhizosphere nitrification. The mechanism accelerating the development of rice root aerenchyma in the high-fertility soil requires further exploration. Investigation of the mechanisms of N loss and the quantification of N loss were not performed in this study but will be addressed by our laboratory in future research. Long-term tillage and fertilisation (especially organic fertiliser) would significantly increase soil fertility, but a large amount of organic matter would decrease the soil oxygen content. Fortunately, rice planting altered the water layer and soil oxygen status via root ROL, and rice in the fertile soil further improved the rhizosphere soil oxidisation environment. Our results suggest that increased fertilisation could lead to increased soil aeration in red soil regions in China, which might promote rice growth and rice N nutrition.']"
2016-01-06T00:00:00Z,Drought-Stressed Tomato Plants Trigger Bottom–Up Effects on the Invasive Tetranychus evansi,"['Our data reveal that both drought and T. evansi infestation induced significant changes in the nutritional quality of tomato plants, as more essential amino acids and free sugars are available. These changes trigger a bottom-up effect on key biological traits of T evansi causing a highly significant increase of leaf damage and mite performance. Plant defense proteins were also induced by drought and/or mite infestation, but the mite physiological responses suggest that T. evansi is capable of circumventing their potential adverse effects. These findings support the “Plant stress hypothesis” and suggest that drought-stressed tomato plants even at a mild level may be more prone to T evansi outbreaks in a climate change scenario, which might strongly affect tomato production on area-wide scales. Moreover, abiotic stresses can also exert a strong impact at higher tropic levels. Thus, it has been demonstrated recently that plant water status may also trigger bottom-up effects on the reproductive behavior and fitness of some natural enemies, especially the omnivorous predators [51, 52], which might shape the arthropod structure. Therefore, this complexity of food-web structures should be considered when using species distribution models to infer climate change effects on crop pests.']"

G-HypoT possible influenced the human whey proteome of colostrum, decreasing metabolic and cell-structure proteins and increasing immunity-related proteins, which may affect the transportation of nutrition and bioactive components for infants. We found that theduration of jaundice was longer in infants of G-HypoT (50±14.1) mothers than no-G-HypoT(30±17.3) mothers. But there was no difference in infant birth length and weight between the two groups. May be a more large sample will show difference, or therapy relief hypothroidism influence on mothers and thus the milk. So influence of alteration caused by G-HypoT may need a period to make difference on clinical characteristics of infant health. Since our sample size was small, large prospective cohort studies should be performed to verify our findings. The impact of maternal gestational hypothyroidism on infant growth index and nutrient status should also be taken into account, along with changes in milk components during the course of lactation. The present study provides insight into proteomic differences in the colostral whey of G-HypoT women in comparison to non-G-HypoT women.']"

Our findings allowed confirmation of earlier observations regarding determinants, especially demographic, environmental and nutritional factors that might influence the fecal carriage of SBSEC members. Such data was previously only obtained from hospital-based studies and was thus less representative for the general population. We noted a significantly higher rate of Sii fecal carriage in elderly, in consumers of artisanal butter, as well as in subjects in close contact with livestock and livestock primary products. The livestock proximity has been identified as a risk factor for Sii fecal carriage, indicating a possible transmission of Sii from animals to humans. The population structure of Sii in Côte d’Ivoire revealed a close relationship across human and dairy isolates in East and West Africa with a predicted founder linking back to a Kenyan human isolate. The presence of dairy adaptations and isolation origins however suggest the establishment of multiple dairy lineages and an evolution driven by recombination rather than clonal development. In-depth investigations on the ecology, potential reservoirs and pathways of contamination by Sii at the human-animal-environment interface in Africa will be needed in comparison to yet to be collected data from Europe, Asia and the Americas to further elucidate the various roles of Sii.']"
2016-09-14T00:00:00Z,"The Steady State Great Ape? Long Term Isotopic Records Reveal the Effects of Season, Social Rank and Reproductive Status on Bonobo Feeding Behavior","['Our long-term isotope dataset on free-ranging habituated bonobos is the most comprehensive of its kind to date and the first allowing for testing the relationships between environmental, social and demographic factors, and stable isotope ratios in hair. Based on our plant analyses we conclude that low canopy foliage such as THV can be considered a useful isotopic tracer in tropical forest settings to reconstruct feeding niches. THV is particularly low in δ13C values, rich in crude protein and thus its consumption should be well detectable in hair protein. We were able to show that social dominance rank does indeed affect individual access to high trophic level food resources in male bonobos, but not in females. In females, our results suggest the diet mainly differs between individuals in different phases of reproduction. If our interpretation of female bonobo isotope patterns is suitable, the δ13C values of female primates are mainly driven by food choice, while the δ15N values in these capital breeders may be influenced additionally by the physiological demands of reproduction. This assumption should be tested in other primate species in the future. Our findings may find increased consideration in future ecological research employing stable isotope analysis in wild and captive capital breeders.']"

The low grade inflammatory status present in obesity triggers the associated comorbidities and this is less considered within the medical examination. The results obtained within the study sustain the determination of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6 and leptin which proved to be efficient in the evaluation of the health status in the obese/ overweight group and could reveal an early inflammatory state, in spite of the normal range of well-known blood biomarkers. Moreover, the level of interleukin-6 was strong correlated with BMI which is the general accepted method used for the assessment of the obesity or overweight degree.The determination of these markers in saliva samples by a stochastic method proved the utility within the medical examination for a better evaluation of the health status in obesity. The method has some advantages like: easy collection of the biological sample, fast determination of low concentrations and could be promising in case of no associated oral cavity infections or inflammations which could interfere the results. Future studies should consider the fluctuation of these pro-inflammatory markers present in saliva of the obese/overweight patients who are diagnosed with other diseases like endocrine disorders and the evolution of these parameters during the healthy diet program.']"
2015-04-02T00:00:00Z,Mitochondrial Vulnerability and Increased Susceptibility to Nutrient-Induced Cytotoxicity in Fibroblasts from Leigh Syndrome French Canadian Patients,"['In conclusion, results from our study provide the first comprehensive assessment of the mitochondrial function phenotype in fibroblasts from LSFC patients. We show that the LRPPRC A354V mutation, and resulting COX deficiency, is associated with several morphological and functional mitochondrial abnormalities. These alterations include an increased fragmentation of the mitochondrial network, a hallmark of the mitochondrial stress response [51], impaired OXPHOS capacity, lower membrane potential, and increased sensitivity to Ca2+-induced permeability transition. However, in contrast to isolated complex I [40,41,44,45] and complex III [46] deficiencies, mitochondrial superoxide production is not enhanced in LSFC cells, which supports the notion that the pathogenic importance of oxidative stress is disease-specific [46]. Our results also demonstrate that LSFC fibroblasts are more susceptible to the cytotoxic effect of palmitate alone or in combination with lactate. This phenomenon could be linked to an impaired ability to oxidize excess fatty acids and mitochondrial reductive stress. Collectively, our results raise some concerns about the potential negative impact of a high-fat diet and of antioxidant treatments in LSFC patients. Although there are clear limitations related to extrapolation of data obtained in fibroblasts in vitro to the in vivo situation, we believe that these data provide important new information that should be validated once murine models of LSFC become available.']"

In addition, the study implies that peppermint oil can also be used in mixed form with lemon oil for effective fumigations. With respect to the phytochemical residues, the identified major residual compounds such as 1-menthone, menthyl acteate, eucalyptal and eugenol, and their respective oils are generally recognised as safe (GRAS) [33–36]. Accordingly, we study suggests that, peppermint and lemon oils can be considered as safer alternatives for commodity treatments. Also, the phytochemical residues could be probably removed by 24 hours aeration, as suggested by Lee et al. [6] for eucalyptol compound. Likely, the residual compounds in peppermint oil fumigated grains may also be removed upon aeration. In addition, Isman [37] reviewed that residues from edible EOs are beneficial to human health by pass through diet. Furthermore, peppermint oil is exempted from Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) for pesticide formulation in alone or in combination with other ingredients [38]. Hence, our study suggests peppermint oil as a potent bio-fumigant and could be applied with the reduced residual risk under direct exposure to commodities in alone or in mixture with lemon oil for the control of S. oryzae in stored product commodities.']"

However, these studies are largely limited to vertebrate systems, and until now, metagenomic investigations of insect guts have focused primarily on insects with specialized diets, including the termite, corn borer and honeybee [5, 14, 73]. The microbial diversity and community structure associated with an omnivorous insect gut, and how that assemblage changes over the length of the alimentary tract, has not been well studied. In this study we characterized the microbial community composition of the Panchlora cockroach foregut, midgut, and hindgut, and compared these microbial communities to those of the already well defined and closely associated leaf-cutter ant fungus gardens and refuse piles. Our study reveals a distinct transition from the foregut community of this insect, which is composed primarily of bacterial genera present in the leaf-cutter ant fungus garden material used as a food source, to a host-specific microbiome in the midgut and hindgut composed primarily of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes with a high capacity for lignocellulose degradation. Our work underscores the importance of the dynamic interplay between ecological interactions and host-specificity in shaping the complex microbial communities of metazoans.']"
2014-06-18T00:00:00Z,Unraveling the Relative Importance of Oral and Dermal Contaminant Exposure in Reptiles: Insights from Studies Using the Western Fence Lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis),"['Our findings suggest that given similar doses, dermal and oral exposure to phthalates will result in relatively similar body residues, with oral exposure having generally greater residues. Chemical properties play an important role in understanding the relative importance of oral and dermal exposure. For example, DMP (lower lipophilicity) was not well absorbed in either treatment in comparison to higher log Kow chemicals, but was better absorbed in oral treatments than dermal. Understanding the relationship between chemical properties and exposure routes will lead the way toward developing more accurate exposure models. In relation to ecological risk assessment, dermal exposure should not be ignored unless mathematical exposure models suggest that daily exposure from contaminated diet will greatly exceed dermal exposure. This research points to the need for better dermal exposure models to provide realistic dermal exposure estimates to compare to dietary exposures. Interest in including reptiles in the ecological risk assessment process is increasing [6]. However, the history of risk assessment is based on knowledge of bird and mammal physiology and behavior. More research is needed to understand how the exposure scenarios of terrestrial reptiles differ from birds and mammals to accurately estimate exposure for these taxa. This research represents a first step in improving our understanding of contaminant exposure in reptiles.']"

Moreover, optimal dietary choline reduced pH value partly by increasing lactate concentration in fish muscle. Optimal dietary choline improved fish flesh WHC partly through enhancing muscle antioxidant status by a) increasing muscle GSH content, which might be partly due to up-regulation gene expression of GCL, and b) up-regulating Cu/Zn-SOD, GPx and GST activities, which might be partly ascribed to up-regulation of their gene expression. Moreover, the gene expression may be regulated by several signaling molecules (Nrf2, Keap1 a, Keap1b, CK2 and TOR) that are involved in the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Interestingly, the effect of choline on antioxidant status in fish muscle was different from our study in immune organs [35]. All of the results provide a partial mechanism for the positive effect of dietary choline on flesh quality. However, the exact mechanisms of choline’s effects require further investigation.

Findings from various studies suggest that the link between SES and stroke at the country level may occult different realities between urban and rural populations.Emerging patterns in developing countries should continue to be monitored to maximize the potential for primary stroke prevention activities by focusing on the part of the population enduring the highest risk. In this study, we found a significant association between household socioeconomic status and prevalence of stroke. Our main result is that individuals from the most deprived urban households bear a higher probability of stroke compared to the rest of the population in Morocco. This result could be explained by the higher presence of behavioral risk factors (unhealthy diet, insufficient physical activity, tobacco smoking, etc.) in this specific category of the population which leads in turn to metabolic/physiological risk factors of stroke such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, etc.Hence, it is important that policy makers focus their efforts on primary stroke prevention. In addition to health education and policies aimed at facilitating the adoption of healthy lifestyles by individuals, targeting stroke prevention efforts on poor urban households can participate in the effective implementation of stroke prevention to tackle the growing related burden in Morocco.']"

Skin photosynthesis accounts for a large proportion of 25(OH)D concentration [33]. As a result, the inverse association between cloud–adjusted solar UVB exposure and incidence rates is likely to be mediated by circulating 25(OH)D, which is highly dependent on solar UVB irradiance. Also, clinical studies have shown similar associations in individuals as those seen in this report between countries [7, 8].This study revealed a strikingly large difference in country-level leukemia risk when comparing equatorial countries to high-latitude countries. Studies comparing large regions, such as countries or subnational entities, may be more likely find greater differences in disease risk, given that the distinction between two large regions may be more likely to encompass widely different cultural practices and norms, such as those pertaining to diet, the components of which broadly influence risk for chronic diseases. While regression models in this study included life expectancy in order to control for this source of confounding, studies among individuals should be conducted in order to definitively determine whether differences in leukemia risk according to vitamin D status are consistent with those presented here with country-level UVB irradiance.']"

In the able-bodied population, the combination of regular physical activity and dietary manipulation (to generate a sustainable energy deficit) is the cornerstone of obesity and type II diabetes mellitus management [47, 48]. Considering how prevalent such conditions are in persons with SCI, we advocate a renewed impetus to expand upon the limited existing evidence-base concerning the combination of diet and exercise, to reduce VAT and promote concomitant improvements in cardiometabolic health in this population. The proposed cutoffs herein may better identify persons at risk of chronic cardiometabolic diseases than those used previously, specific to certain ethnicities. Determining whether men with SCI exceed these proposed site specific anthropometric cutoffs might help facilitate earlier identification of persons at increased risk of developing cardiometabolic diseases. Future studies are necessary to cross-validate our proposed anthropometric cutoffs of central adiposity in persons with SCI and ascertain their validity in a larger sample size as well as in a female cohort. It is hoped progress in this area allows practitioners to more easily and better identify persons at increased risk of chronic diseases and provide early prevention guidance.']"

The isotope analyses performed on human, faunal and seed samples, combined with archeobotanical and molecular analysis of dental calculus, revealed that the population generally adopted an omnivorous diet, in which plants and fruits played a prominent role. With regard to animal protein intake, cattle, sheep and pig meat were consumed with a minor contribution of chicken. Consumption of C4 plants (millet and/or sorghum) was also evidenced in a few individuals. Significantly, the application of multiple complementary methodologies revealed a potential intake of marine foodstuffs as dietary resource for this Medieval population. The consumption of marine foods was not clearly detectable using stable isotope evidence, highlighting the limitations of using this method alone in the Mediterranean context. Archaeobotanical analysis further revealed the presence of artemisinin that may be an indication of the presence of malaria in the area of Santa Severa. The dietary (e.g. cereals, Brassicaceae) and medicinal (e.g. pomegranate, Ephedra sp.) uses of other plant species was also hypothesised. This innovative archaeobotanical approach combined with the anthropological data may provide interesting information about presence and diffusion of pathologies and diseases in the past, beyond those are not directly detectable on skeletal remains.']"
2016-05-17T00:00:00Z,Forest Management Intensity Affects Aquatic Communities in Artificial Tree Holes,"['Our results indicate that forest management has substantial and pervasive effects on communities which may alter their structure and functioning through a number of different mechanisms. Whereas more direct impacts of management on other types of communities in forests had been reported before [1, 3–5], the effect on aquatic communities constitutes novel information (but see Gossner et al. [10] for natural tree holes). We did not find strong individual direct pathways that may explain the effect of forest management intensity on communities via the measured environmental variables. Instead, multiple indirect effects seem to be central here. These could for example operate via effects of management on the species richness of trees and other plants, changing light and temperature conditions, resource input into tree holes and the structure of the matrix between communities that may influence dispersal processes and conditions for adult insects (e.g. nutrition and shelter). By investigating community change in tree holes we may be integrating over a number of direct and indirect effects to derive a more comprehensive picture of the consequences of change in forest management intensity on communities. We furthermore conclude that artificial tree-hole analogues constitute a useful experimental alternative to test effects of land-use change on natural communities and may indeed be used as an early-warning or indicator system of ecosystem modifications in conservation assessments.']"
2018-05-02T00:00:00Z,Diversity and population structure of red rice germplasm in Bangladesh,"['In general, care should be taken when selecting germplasm for any breeding program attempting yield enhancement. Cluster analysis from the agro-morphological features grouped all the germplasm into five groups. Significant (at both p ≤ 0.05 and p ≤ 0.01) differences were found in all fifteen agro-morphological traits, which confirms the presence of diversification among the fifty red rice germplasm. From molecular analysis using SSR markers, three groups were found, while population structure analysis showed all tested germplasm constructed as four populations, each significantly differentiated and with their variation confirmed by AMOVA.From the findings of the population structure analysis, in particular, large genetic differences were also observed between two populations (group A and D), suggesting that these could be crossed to improve grain yield. As such, the germplasm, as well as the highly polymorphic SSR markers identified in this study, have the potential to facilitate a red rice breeding program for enhanced yield. Based on these findings, we are currently developing such a program to facilitate more desirable, novel trait-linked markers usable for not only the mapping of QTLs/genes against a diversity of abiotic and biotic stresses but also the breeding of socially and economically desirable traits in red rice. The findings of this study provide a solid foundation for such further work in the effort to increase the yields of this increasingly popular and both medically and nutritively beneficial red rice.']"
2016-11-15T00:00:00Z,Food Insecurity and Common Mental Disorders among Ethiopian Youth: Structural Equation Modeling,"['In this study, food insecurity was associated with common mental disorders among youth in Ethiopia. The pathway was mainly direct, suggesting that lack of access to reliable and sufficient amounts of food not only affected youths’ physical health and nutritional status but also their mental health. The implications of these findings are far-reaching. First, exploring such evidence might indicates the social inequalities at earliest age and or the long-term trajectories of food insecurity that could persist into poor health status in adulthood. Second, this evidence could direct program planners, policy makers to design proper interventions for prevention of both mental health and food insecurity status. It gives insights on the importance of considering strategies to improve access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to curtail the detrimental effect of food insecurity on physical and mental health of youth. Further analysis will aim to verify these results with additional sources of data to see the longitudinal effect of exposures to food insecurity on mental health, and examine other plausible models to better understand the mechanism by which food insecurity is linked to poor mental health. Additional investigation is also recommended to verify the mediation role of time varying measures, whether changes in the mediator are more likely to precede the change in mental health status, and to what extent temporal order of change over time leads to plausible conclusions about the mediation and their relationship.']"
2016-10-18T00:00:00Z,Assessing Program Coverage of Two Approaches to Distributing a Complementary Feeding Supplement to Infants and Young Children in Ghana,"['Delivery Model 1 performed well in terms of achieved message, contact, and effective coverages. Effective coverage achieved by Delivery Model 2 was low despite increases in message and contact coverages.Findings from the present work suggest that future programming efforts should use the health extension / microfinance / petty trader approach (Delivery Model 1) in rural settings and consider adapting this approach for use in urban and peri-urban settings. Ongoing BCC and demand creation activities will be essential to the continued success of any such programming.The work reported here indicates that product availability and brand recognition, while necessary, are not sufficient to deliver effective coverage and impact. The use of social marketing is not a simple alternative for achieving high coverage and impact for health and nutrition interventions. This is likely to be particularly true if the product is one for which there is no pre-existing supply chain, no pre-existing demand (home fortification is a new feeding behavior), and a consumer-base subject to a high and constant churn rate (children enter and leave the consumer-base as they age), and which may offer a low potential for profit. Such products will need skillful and sustained BCC and demand creation work in potential consumers and throughout the supply chain if coverage and impact are to be achieved. Successful use of markets requires hard and exacting work for which there is no magical labor-saving mechanism that can be easily harnessed to deliver public goods.']"
2016-02-11T00:00:00Z,Elevated Blood Lead Levels Are Associated with Reduced Risk of Malaria in Beninese Infants,"['In conclusion, our study shows that BLL are negatively associated with malarial risk considering other risk factors. Malaria entails high morbidity and mortality rates among infants under 5 years worldwide[10], and lead poisoning is the 6th most important contributor to the global burden of diseases measured in disability adjusted life years (DALYs) according to the Institute of Health Metrics, with Sub-Saharan African countries being predominantly responsible for the global DALYs[30]. Our study shows very high rates of EBLL in young infants (12 months). This should raise the awareness of public health authorities to further evaluate the sources and the epidemiological consequences for infants. Lead poisoning entails severe consequences for the development of the children and is associated with major health problems highly prevalent in West Africa, such as anemia and under-nutrition, having an important impact on the infants and their communities. In addition, our study is the first to show a negative association between lead levels and malaria risk in multivariable analyses. Therefore, these results should be confirmed in the context of a prospective cohort. Furthermore, the social and financial consequences of EBLL and lead poisoning appeal to further explore the epidemiological evidence of the association of EBLL with communicable diseases in developing countries. Finally, public health interventions should look forward to minimize the exposure to lead. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the lead sources to better protect the population in West Africa.']"

We have thoroughly mapped the proteins in both their Native organization and under denaturing conditions, respectively using BN-PAGE and standard 2DE. Furthermore and as this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first application of the BN-PAGE technique to mammary gland mitochondria, we have also contributed to the establishment of adequate and reproducible laboratorial methodology of use in this type of tissue. We have finally studied the protein expression changes in the mammary gland of two goat breeds with different levels of tolerance to SWL, highlighting several proteins that showed differential expression between breeds and nutritional treatments and as such, and upon adequate validation, could be proposed as putative biomarkers of tolerance to SWL and maintenance of lactation and mammary gland function in these animals. Results indicate that SWL tolerance and milk production under SWL are related to proteins involved in the apoptotic and cell senescence processes, with higher expression results in the Palmera breed, whereas the Majorera breed maintains the expression of these proteins at constant level. The control of apoptosis seems therefore to be the key link to understand SWL tolerance and its links to the production performances of these animals. These results furthermore serve as a basis for studies in other domestic dairy ruminants, particularly sheep and cattle. Understanding the molecular basis of tolerance to SWL is a complex task. It would therefore be interesting to conduct further research at the transcriptomics, proteomics (extra mitochondrial), lipidomics and metabolomics levels.']"
2016-05-03T00:00:00Z,Whole Blood Levels of the n-6 Essential Fatty Acid Linoleic Acid Are Inversely Associated with Stunting in 2-to-6 Year Old Tanzanian Children: A Cross-Sectional Study,"['This study assessed whole blood levels of EFAs and the association between whole blood FA levels and growth parameters in children 2–6 years of age. EFA levels in 2-to-6 year old Tanzanian children were low as demonstrated by high levels of Mead acid and large T/T ratios, both markers of EFAD. In this population, levels of certain FAs in blood were associated with growth parameters. Most notably, higher n-6 FA levels were associated with greater linear growth whereas higher n-9 FA levels were associated with impaired linear growth. The inadequate levels of FAs in this population may not only be associated with impaired growth, but may also be associated with impaired immunity or poor cognitive development. Thus, future studies of nutritional interventions for Tanzanian children should consider providing FAs in addition to sufficient calories, protein and micronutrients. Additionally, these studies should encourage the incorporation of locally available FA-rich seeds and oils into meals and snacks for infants and children. Finally, the development of simple instrumentation that can be used in the field to analyze FAs and FA metabolites in whole blood would be useful for future studies. In sum, this study sets the foundation for future studies assessing the relationship between whole blood FA composition and growth in children residing in other areas of Tanzania, ideally over their entire life course.']"
2015-04-15T00:00:00Z,"Seasonal Patterns of Hormones, Macroparasites, and Microparasites in Wild African Ungulates: The Interplay among Stress, Reproduction, and Disease","['In summary, we found evidence that stress, reproduction, immunity, and pathogens exhibit strong seasonality in ENP. Most zebra and springbok in ENP are indeed seasonal breeders, with both species experiencing parturition and lactation primarily in the wet season, zebra experiencing most estrus and breeding behaviors in the wet season, and both species experiencing mid-gestation in the hot dry season. Overall immune allocation is highest during the wet season, likely driven, at least in part, by nutritional factors [17]. Stress hormone levels are highest overall in the dry season, though these seasonal signals are stronger in zebras. While peaks in reproductive hormone levels are correlated with immunosuppression, increased parasite infection intensity, and decreased anti-anthrax antibody titers, stress hormone levels are largely unaffected by macroparasite prevalence or infection intensity. Instead, stress hormone levels are most strongly correlated with environmental and reproductive factors, particularly with the demands of mid-gestation. This likely indicates that these hosts are evolutionarily tolerant of their GI parasites, despite the fact that they are not neutral actors in these hosts; parasites do affect body condition and use host resources, hosts do allocate immune resources toward keeping parasite infections in check, and parasites likely cause host immunomodulation and may even increase susceptibility to B. anthracis in this system. However, parasite tolerance strategies indeed make sense in a system in which macroparasites are nearly ubiquitous but almost never lethal, while pathogens such as B. anthracis are often lethal but considerably more rare.']"
2019-02-27T00:00:00Z,A case-control study of trace-element status and lung cancer in Appalachian Kentucky,"['Our case-control study provides meaningful participant-level assessment of a randomly selected controls from an area of highest incidence of lung cancer in the United States compared to cancer patients from the same region. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, based on previous studies, we found that there was no positive association between trace-element concentrations, in toenails and lung cancer in our study population. We found a negative association between toenail concentrations and lung cancers for several elements in univariate models (Al, Mn, Cr, and Se) with only Mn being significant in multivariate analysis. Overall, toenail trace element concentrations were similar to or lower than those of controls from a variety of previously studied populations, perhaps accounting for the observed lack of positive correlation with lung cancer incidence. For some elements, such as for Se, Cr and Mn, negative associations with lung cancer may point to nutritional differences in the population that could be associated with cancers or other chronic health conditions; however, a lack of significance in our multivariate models indicates that confounding factors likely explain these associations. While some significant differences in drinking water concentrations were found between cases and controls, the concentrations of trace elements in drinking water were low and were not reflected in toenail concentrations. Additionally, we found that fingernails are not a reliable surrogate for assessing mid-term trace element exposure.']"
2019-03-14T00:00:00Z,Molecular characterization of Bathymodiolus mussels and gill symbionts associated with chemosynthetic habitats from the U.S. Atlantic margin,"['This study characterizes the foundational species from the first seep communities discovered on the U.S. Atlantic seaboard north of BRD. Three bathymodiolin species were present at the three seeps, with Bathymodiolus childressi being by far the most abundant. The presence of single individuals of other species (B. mauritanicus at BCS and B. heckerae at NCS) raises interesting questions regarding dispersal and drivers of distribution within the bathymodiolins. This study coupled with results from [13] provide indirect but compelling evidence that B. childressi utilizes sulfur for metabolism through thiotrophic Campylobacterota epibionts, though there is a contrasting pattern between abundance of the Campylobacterota and isotope signatures between sites. These results draw a complex picture of associations between mussels and symbiotic bacteria in the Northeast Atlantic, which may vary depending on local characteristics of the habitats and microbial interactions. Perhaps the mussels’ ability to take advantage of thiotrophic bacteria is transient, considering the observed variation in the periostracum δ13C as well as small changes in the δ34S [13], which is the best analog for changes over the mussels’ lifespan. Whether the variability observed in the thiotrophy signal between gill samples at this site is due to micro-spatial differential chemical signatures between sampled mussels, or temporal variability of the chemical signatures, remains to be seen. Future studies that couple environmental measurements of chemical species, samples of ambient water, and gill microbiomes in tandem will further elucidate the role that the Campylobacterota epibionts play in host nutrition as well as in oceanic carbon and sulfur cycling.']"

Alterations in blood vessel formation during placental development has the potential to reduce blood flow, leading to reduced nutrient delivery and an environment of fetal undernutrition. Fetal nutrition, or the supply of metabolic substrates delivered for growth and development, contributes to immediate, intermediate, and long-term health [142]. Immediate health consequences include intrauterine growth restriction and low birthweight. Childhood obesity, hypertension, and diabetes are the most common intermediate and long-term health consequences of fetal undernutrition [143]. Some authors postulate that early fetal and infant environment is strongly predictive for the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases later in life [143–147].The main pathways by which preeclampsia or pregnancy-related complications serve to modify vascular risk would appear to be hypoxia, antiangiogenesis, endothelial dysfunction and immune modifications. These pathways individually, synergistically, or cumulatively appear to alter the epigenetic potential of placenta itself including microRNA expression profile. And so the exposition to a preeclampsia or pregnancy-related complication environment in utero leads to altered phenotype after birth [147].']"

Results suggest nutrition, work activities and tourist numbers may affect metabolic, lipid panel and FGM concentrations. We conclude that elephant well-being can be promoted by limiting the amount of high calorie treats given by tourists, ensuring animals receive appropriate amounts of exercise to reduce fat and increase muscle mass, and reducing stress by moderating the numbers of tourists interacting with individual elephants, especially during the High season.Comparing FGM measures to elephants in U.S. zoos (mean, 124.69 ± 4.26 ng/g; range, 59.69–282.88 ng/g; n = 106) [Brown, Ange, Carlstead, unpublished], concentrations in Thailand were within the range, but mean concentrations were lower. The same EIA was employed, but the extraction technique differed, which might explain some of the differences. More work is needed to develop reference ranges for FGM, metabolic marker and lipid measures to determine what is ‘normal’ versus ‘abnormal’, although again, use of different laboratories and techniques can make interpretation challenging. This study also was only conducted for 1 year, so follow up observations are needed to determine if the patterns hold across years, and how changes in management influence subsequent results.']"
2018-01-25T00:00:00Z,"Inhibition of α-glucosidase, α-amylase, and aldose reductase by potato polyphenolic compounds","['Colorado State University postharvest program have been screening the potato cultivars and advanced selections for improved nutrition and health benefits. This study indicated that colored flesh potato tubers contain a mixture of several phenolic compounds ranging from phenolic acid to anthocyanins. We have separated, isolated and characterized the group of phenolic acid and anthocyanin compounds in colored flesh potatoes. It is interesting to note that these group of compounds had significant inhibitory activities on α-glucosidase, α-amylase, and aldose reductase. These phenolic compounds acted effective non-competitive inhibitors and mixed with carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes such as α-amylase and α-glucosidase. Thus polyphenol rich potato tubers have the potential to interfere with or delay absorption of dietary carbohydrates in the small intestine, leading to suppression of postprandial blood glucose sugars. However, there are reports of a problem on the direct intestinal absorption of anthocyanins and phenolic compounds. It was mentioned that about 1% or less of ingested anthocyanin is estimated to be incorporated into plasma. There is a possibility of biotransformation of these phenolic compounds after consumption. Food-grade phenolic inhibitors from potatoes are potentially safer, and therefore may be preferred alternatives for inhibition of carbohydrate breakdown and control of glycemic index. Additionally, the significant inhibitory effect on aldose reductase suggests that phenolic fractions in potato tubers can possess constituents with antidiabetic and inhibitory effects on diabetic complications.']"
2017-08-17T00:00:00Z,Honey bee (Apis mellifera) colony health and pathogen composition in migratory beekeeping operations involved in California almond pollination,"['The health of commercially managed, migratory honey bee colonies in the US [7,10,21,22] and honey colonies located throughout the world [31,61,65–68] is influenced by multiple biotic and abiotic factors. In addition to pathogens, other factors including seasonal variation in colony size, foraging requirements, nutrition, and pesticide exposure all impact colony health [10,35,38,69,70]. Therefore, temporal monitoring projects that emphasize robust sampling designs (e.g., consistent monthly samples obtained on a specific date) and include large sample sizes and multiple monitored factors, are required to fully describe both general and acute threats to honey bee colonies throughout the year and in the context of pollination of specific crops. Additionally, the synergistic effects of co-infecting honey bee pathogens [35,64], which can impact the prevalence and abundance of other pathogens [7,28,31,49], must be investigated from a multidimensional approach to study the effects of pathogens on honey bee colony health. The combination of sampling individual honey bee colonies on specific days of the year and across multiple sites, and employment of statistical methods aimed at integrating and interpreting multifactorial data sets, will further our understanding of the factors with the greatest influence on colony losses and may result in the development of strategies to limit future losses.']"

Evidence from the U.K. suggests that multifaceted interventions combined with research can lead to substantial reductions in a short time. This survey, the first known nationally-representative consumer survey focused on wasted food in the U.S., provides essential data to assist those developing interventions using education, changes in business practices, and policy, as well as baseline data against which to measure effectiveness. It suggests approaches including avoiding treating consumers as if they are completely new to the issue of wasted food, framing messages focused on budgets, and providing smaller portions. In addition, there is a need to sharpen our messages about food safety and freshness in order to expand acceptability of those foods that may be less attractive or nearing their expiration dates but are unlikely to be hazardous, while avoiding waste prevention messaging that could increase food safety hazards. The survey also suggests opportunities to shift business practices to support consumer-desired changes that prevent waste. It highlights critical research gaps, particularly in better understanding the actual behaviors underlying the survey responses provided. Finally, it provides reason for optimism about waste prevention in the U.S.—because respondents are concerned about wasted food, and are interested in taking further action.']"
2015-05-26T00:00:00Z,Flavonoid Intake in European Adults (18 to 64 Years),"['Our results provide a detailed overview of flavonoid consumption in European adults. These results allow for a comparison of habitual intake in the general public with the amounts used in dietary intervention studies. Our data suggest that habitual intake of most compounds is likely too low to result in a reduced risk of cardio-vascular diseases, but also too low to result in adverse effects. However, a lack of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of intervention studies makes these comparisons difficult. Further research is required to investigate the potential health benefits of flavonoids, in particular the primary prevention of chronic diseases in the general public. It is in particular important to use standardised and validated analytical methods and a consistent nomenclature of compounds to ensure that results are comparable. Furthermore, the development of improved dietary assessment methods, especially using nutritional biomarkers, is important to investigate the potential health effects of flavonoids in larger observational studies.An important result of our study was the skewed distribution of flavonoid intake, especially in Belgium and Germany. In both countries, half of the adult population consumed only negligible amounts of monomeric and polymeric flavonoids. Most observational studies conducted so far have found the highest risk of cardio-vascular diseases with very low flavonoid intake [12–14], and even though it is not clear whether this is due to dietary or other factors, it is important to investigate whether these dietary patterns have an impact on public health.']"

In this global health context, this study fills an important gap in the public health literature [11] on the impact of delivering a critically important child survival, nutrition, and human development intervention at scale. Using rigorous cluster-randomized evaluation designs, it shows that comprehensive behavior change strategies implemented at scale, under real-life conditions, and delivered through outreach-based (Bangladesh) and facility-based (Viet Nam) platforms have strong and significant impacts on breastfeeding practices. Strategies that combine intensive IPC with MM campaigns, CM, and advocacy are more effective than standard counseling with less-intensive accompanying strategies. Our study demonstrates the impacts of recommended complex adaptive systems-based approaches to programming for scaling up combined interventions to improve breastfeeding in low- and middle-income countries [10]. We conclude that investments in combined, coordinated, and data-driven strategies, especially those that intensify counseling and are supported by MM, CM, and PA, are recommended for replication in similar contexts and for sustained implementation in Bangladesh and Viet Nam.']"
2016-10-24T00:00:00Z,"The MADS Box Genes ABS, SHP1, and SHP2 Are Essential for the Coordination of Cell Divisions in Ovule and Seed Coat Development and for Endosperm Formation in Arabidopsis thaliana","['Our work suggests that ABS is not only required for the regulation of PA accumulation in the seed coat but that its functions are of much broader impact: they range from positively regulating coordinated cell divisions in the inner integument layer of the ovule, nuclear endosperm proliferation and thus seed cavity expansion, to regulating endothelium cell morphology, and to its influence on mucilage release of the seed coat epidermal cell layer. Novel roles could also be identified for SHP1 and SHP2: these genes are required for synchronized ovule maturation and subsequent fertilization/seed maturation, seed mucilage production, and have an inhibitory effect which is antagonistic to the ABS function in controlling formative divisions and cell shape of the inner integument and seed coat layers. Unlike SHP1 and SHP2, which are the result of a rather recent genome duplication and specific to the Brassicaceae [64], orthologs of ABS were present in the most recent common ancestor of gymnosperms and angiosperms [25]. The newly discovered function of ABS in endosperm development and its coordination with inner seed coat formation provide a hint towards original function of Bsister genes, which may be conserved throughout the seed plants. The ability to protect the zygote by integuments from the environment and to produce a nutritive tissue embedding and supporting the embryo and providing nutrients to the seedling after germination is one of the key traits to seed plant success to which the Bsister genes have contributed significantly.']"
2018-11-14T00:00:00Z,The gill-associated microbiome is the main source of wood plant polysaccharide hydrolases and secondary metabolite gene clusters in the mangrove shipworm Neoteredo reynei,"['In this study we applied metagenomics to characterize the microbial communities of the digestive gland, intestine and gill of the mangrove specialist shipworm Neoteredo reynei. We provided strong evidences that the N. reynei gill symbiont gammaproteobacterial community is a hot spot for biotechnologically relevant enzymes, such as CAZymes involved on breaking down wood-derived complex polysaccharides, and biosynthetic gene clusters for production of potentially bioactive secondary metabolites such as complex polyketides, peptides and lipopeptides. Further, the discrete bacterial communities forming the microbiome of the digestive tract tissues seems to have little or no involvement in host nutritional support or chemical defense. Digestive gland and intestine datasets presented a simple repertoire of CAZymes, lacking GHs for digestion of woody material, and only one fragmented BGC with hits to a locus of the Yesso scallop bivalve mollusk genome. Two representative symbiotic genomes were recovered from gill symbiotic community and taxonomically assigned as a T. turnerae strain and a yet to be cultivated Teredinibacter sp. bacterium. The latter encoded novel multi-catalytic CAZymes, and a trans-AT PKS BGC containing the catalytic domains implicated in β-branching in related polyketides. Finally, we demonstrate that the Teredinibacter genus is highly enriched in secondary metabolite pathways in comparison to relatives of the Cellvibrionaceae family, including a plethora of BGCs for complex polyketides and nonribosomal peptides, reinforcing the possible role of these compounds on supporting the symbiosis.']"

Firstly is maternal education. Maternal education was found to have a protective effect on risk of anaemia. The government should focus on providing information to young mothers on adequate nutrition for their young babies. Information on food products including indigenous African foods, which contain relevant vitamins and iron, will go a long way in reducing anaemia prevalence in the country [11]–[13], [28], [29].Secondly, up scaling interventions on malaria and ensuring that these interventions cover most parts of the country will lead to reduction in anaemia cases. This is a consequence of the finding that there is strong association between malaria and anaemia in the children.Hither to, the study highlights two main areas which could provide avenues for reducing the prevalence of anaemia in Kenya. These areas are, controlling co-morbidity of malaria and anaemia, and improving maternal knowledge.No study goes without limitations. One major limitation of this study is the cross-sectional nature of the study. Follow-up studies provide more insight into public health problems. Another limitation was due to the fact that anaemia was measured based on hemoglobin concentration only, inclusion of other measures such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and plasma ferriton (PF) concentration [30] could lead to better diagnosis results. Despite these limitations, this present study has determined the prevalence and risk factors of anaemia among children.']"

While the patterns and processes observed in the open pools seems to be mostly driven by physical factors and the tolerance of organisms to such conditions, in closed pools there seems to be a synergy between physical factors and biotic interactions (e.g. reef fish feeding pressure and herbivory). The functioning and structure of closed pools are probably a combination of: (1) algal turfs that comprised around 50% of benthic cover and were mostly composed by small cropped pieces of the alga Digenea simplex, that has a high nutritional value and was highly consumed in herbivory assays; (2) high abundance of Acanthurus chirurgus using these pools as refuges to wave exposure and predation; (3) high feeding pressure of A. chirurgus affecting the benthic composition of this habitat by cropping D. simplex and limiting its growth and distribution. Thus, the direct effect of wave exposure interacts with the indirect effect of predators on fish feeding behavior and play an important role in the structure and functioning of these habitats. The relative contribution of direct vs. indirect mechanisms shaping biological communities and how they scale-up to ecosystem functioning deserve further attention, particularly on isolated near-pristine systems where natural processes can still be studied under limited human impact.']"
2018-10-17T00:00:00Z,"Combined effects of elevated temperature and Deepwater Horizon oil exposure on the cardiac performance of larval mahi-mahi, Coryphaena hippurus","['A combination of elevated temperature and crude oil exposure has a differential effect on severity of morphological impairments and cardiac performance in mahi. Elevated temperature influenced solubility, bioavailability of some compounds and gas transport. However, elevated water temperature did not protect the heart from functional oil-induced modifications, such as bradycardia. Stroke volume was unaffected, and cardiac output only slightly affected, by elevated temperature. Furthermore, reduction of edema in the pericardium and yolk sinus cavity occurred at 30°C. Nevertheless, a potential protective role of warmer temperature cannot be supported, because of a lethal effect observed at higher exposure concentrations. Quite the contrary, this smaller area of edema is probably morphologically related to the advanced development in time of larvae, in which yolk sac absorption becomes more important and nutritional and energetic reserves decrease, leading to increasing vulnerability of larval fish. We suggest that elevated temperature may decrease larval resilience to oil exposure by amplifying energetic costs to organisms. However, it is difficult to demonstrate this effect of increased energetic costs with short term exposure. This study adds growing evidence to the importance of considering environmental factors in risk assessment of anthropogenic pollutants on physiology and fitness of aquatic organisms. In the current context of global warming, environmental water temperature should be considered as a key variable and thermally related physiological challenges should be used in toxicity testing to further explore physiological and ecological impacts of these interactions.']"

Additionally, mothers of boys and of were more likely to want CLS, whereas mothers of girls and of overweight and obese children were more likely to want CTS. A positive correlation was observed between maternal body dissatisfaction and dissatisfaction with child's body size. This study suggests that mothers tend to transpose their body dissatisfaction to their child's body, as well as their desire to lose or gain weight. Thus, the study findings can help guide health professionals and policy makers to develop and improve interventions and public policies that seek to prevent weight problems in children.Within this context, the discussion about current health and beauty standards and their impact on the perception of child's nutritional status gains relevance. Furthermore, maternal involvement in strategies to prevent and treat childhood overweight is relevant, and maternal concerns and dissatisfactions with her body and with her child's body should be considered. Therefore, it is necessary that health professionals make an integral approach because the mother’s dissatisfaction with child’s body size can have a potential impact on maternal attitudes and practices related to children's food intake and on the relationship of children with their own body size as they mature. Moreover, longitudinal studies should be conducted to evaluate the influence of maternal dissatisfaction with child's body size on maternal practices and attitudes related to their child’s body, food consumption and lifestyle.""]"

We have mined the genome of C. acnes and identified a set of genes that are likely candidates for degradation of host N-glycans. We have also presented the biochemical and structural characterization of one enzyme in the proposed pathway, namely the exo-β-1,4-mannosidase that is able to catalyze hydrolysis of the β-1,4-glycosidic bond between the second GlcNAc and the first mannose residue in the canonical eukaryotic N-glycan core. This is the first reported enzymatic activity of subfamily GH5_18, and the first characterized GH5 enzyme likely to be involved in N-glycan degradation. Our results provide a valuable platform for further efforts to elucidate the complete set of activities of the proposed C. acnes N-glycan degradation pathway.Based on our structural and functional characterization of CaMan5_18, and whole-genome analysis, we propose a pathway for complete N-glycan degradation and utilization by C. acnes strain 266, results that offer new insights into the host-microbe interaction of this bacterium. We propose that this pathway allows the C. acnes to use host N-glycans as a means of nutrition, and possibly, also to contribute to virulence in susceptible individuals. The ability to degrade N-glycans would complement the demonstrated ability of C. acnes to disassemble O-glycans, which makes this bacterium well adapted to utilize a wide range of host glycans.']"

Our study lead to conclude that addition of onion skin powder to wheat pasta allows an evident improvement of several nutritional properties compared with non-supplemented pasta. We have demonstrated a noticeable increase in the total dietary fibre, total phenolic content, flavonoids and antioxidant capacity. From the technological point of view, the dry skin onion can be an additive that enriches the pasta. However, its quantity should be optimized every times depending on the quality of other materials used in the pasta production. This allows to obtain a product that is sensorial acceptable and at the same time has higher pro-health values.The exploitation of by-products of fruit and vegetable processing as a source of functional compounds and their application in food is more often discussed in literature. Design of new food products should take account of complex matrix and their composition of bioactive principles. Also requires careful assessment of potential risks which might arise from isolated compounds recovered from by-products. Furthermore, investigations on stability and interactions of phytochemicals with other food ingredients during processing and storage need to be conducted. Consumer protection must have priority over economic interests, and health claims should be substantiated by scientifically sound and reliable studies.']"
2013-03-21T00:00:00Z,"The Effect of Dietary Prebiotics and Probiotics on Body Weight, Large Intestine Indices, and Fecal Bile Acid Profile in Wild Type and IL10−/− Mice","['Using purified isocaloric diets, we examined the biological effects of dietary pre- and probiotics separately and in combination in wildtype and IL10-null mice. In Aim 1, food intake, body weight and the weight of liver and spleen were not affected by isocaloric dietary supplementation of pre- and/or probiotics in young and adult mice, suggesting that caloric density, rather than pre- or probiotics per se, is a main determinant of body weight. Similar to published observation, inulin-supplemented mice showed increased cecal weight, which is consistent with an increased growth of commensal bacteria. In Aim 2, alterations in fecal bile acid pattern were consistently observed after the dietary intake of prebiotics in the absence or presence of probiotics but the change did not impact on the intestinal fluid balance. Nevertheless, our findings support that fecal bile acid profiling, especially a reduction of taurine conjugates in the feces, may be a useful biomarker for the intake of prebiotics in mice and potentially in human as well. Dietary probiotic Bb12 alone affected neither cecal weight nor the fecal bile pattern at the dose used in this study. In the subpart of Aim 1 and Aim 2, IL10-null mice showed a similar trend of responses to pre- and probiotic supplementation as the wildtype mice. However, a slightly smaller cecum was observed in IL10-null mice in the absence of inflammation, which is consistent to the known growth-promoting effect of inflammation-related cytokine reported previously.']"
2013-01-16T00:00:00Z,Carbon and Nitrogen Isotopic Survey of Northern Peruvian Plants: Baselines for Paleodietary and Paleoecological Studies,"['Maize from the study area has a mean δ13C value of −11.8±0.4‰, which suggests that a δ13C value (adjusted for the Suess Effect) of ca. −10.3 ‰ would be appropriate for paleodietary models in the region. Leguminous cultigens were characterized by significantly lower δ15N values and higher N contents than non-leguminous cultigens; this distinction was not as clear for wild legumes. Marine plants were characterized by δ13C values intermediate between wild terrestrial C3 and C4 vegetation and δ15N values that were very similar to terrestrial plants growing at low altitudes. C4 plants were generally more abundant at lower altitude sites. Carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions of wild plants were strongly influenced by local environmental factors. Foliar δ13C was positively correlated with altitude and negatively correlated with mean annual precipitation. Foliar δ15N was negatively correlated with altitude and mean annual precipitation.While the last twenty years have seen a proliferation of studies utilizing the isotopic analysis of archaeological materials for the purpose of reconstructing diet, the development of isotopic baselines for interpreting such data has lagged behind these investigations. This hampers our ability to realize the full potential of isotopic data. This study begins to fill part of that gap by providing an initial understanding of the baseline isotopic variation in plants from northern Peru. Further studies of this nature are required to better understand baseline isotopic variation in other regions.']"

Between 2003 and 2014, increases were observed in the proportions of pregnant women who attended four or more ANC visits, complete immunization, medical treatment of diarrhea and fever, use of ORS during diarrhea, use of ITNs, and proper disposal of child’s stool. To the contrary, decreases were observed among children who were offered same/more fluid/food when they had diarrhea and children who consumed the minimum acceptable diet. Area of residence (region), household wealth, maternal education, parity, mother's age, child’s age and pregnancy history were significant determinants of optimal childcare practices across the three surveys.National, regional and local child health promotion activities, coupled with changes in society and in living conditions between 2003 and 2014, could have influenced uptake of certain recommended childcare practices in Kenya, while other practices worsened. Concerted efforts are needed to address the consistent inequities in the uptake of the recommended childcare practices. Such efforts should be cognizant of the underlying factors that affect childcare in Kenya such as region of residence, household wealth, maternal education, parity, mother's age, child’s age and pregnancy history. Also important is linking child health education promotion activities that are informed by recent advances in health communication scholarship [65,66].""]"

These transcriptomes represent the first genetic study about this insect pest, with a total of 53,529 protein sequences being annotated. Data obtained from this study will contribute to a significant understanding of the biology of this important pest.From our data, we drew more interesting information regarding the digestive physiology of M fryanus. The presence of cysteine and serine peptidases along the digestive tract seems to favor this insect in exploring different diet possibilities. Selected GHs appear to be related to digestive (cellulolytic degradation) and immunological (recognition molecules and antimicrobial peptides) functions. Serpins might be involved in many biological processes. In M. fryanus, it appears to be active mainly in immune system and for control of digestive action. We identified an otopetrin-like transcript being expressed in fat body. Probably otocolyth formation is expected to play a role in gravity sensing. Besides, to the best of our knowledge, the present report is the first regarding differential expression of this gene in a Coleoptera. The otopetrin-like transcript seems to be a promising target for pest control, since a silencing of this gene could hamper the larvae from emerging to the surface to feed or reproduce.The M. fryanus transcriptomic data generated in this study can help accelerate future studies to understand the diverse aspects of the insect physiology and biochemistry.']"

2016-09-08T00:00:00Z,"The Active Metabolite of Warfarin (3'-Hydroxywarfarin) and Correlation with INR, Warfarin and Drug Weekly Dosage in Patients under Oral Anticoagulant Therapy: A Pharmacogenetics Study","['In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that a wide significant variation exists in warfarin dose maintenance, also in established OAT patients. By means the common practical approach, the reaching of target INR in patients starting OAT needs a long time of drug adjustment during which patients might have INR values out of range and might be exposed to potential clinical complications and risks. Approximately, more than 50% of inter-individual variation is due to SNPs in VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genes, and also considering age, concomitant therapy, diet and patient compliance, the remaining percentage of variations remains in part unexplained. Pharmacogenetics investigations to recognize patients a priori with regard to drug dosage and clinical response was recommended by FDA in 2007 for old and new drugs on based evidence, suggesting and encouraging to include also warfarin treatment [37–39]. For these reasons, only INR monitoring could be limited for dose-adjustment or for target-INR reaching. The assessment of the active serum 3’-hydroxywarfarin together with warfarin concentration may be of extraordinary help in managing patients on OAT on the basis of the finding that warfarin revealed an unexpected lost of correlation in multivariate analysis, whilst 3’-hydroxywarfarin kept very appreciable levels. Moreover, in light of the evidence that sophisticated equipments are not required, with the exception of a regular HPLC apparatus, these measurements should be included in the anticoagulant laboratories as routine practice also aimed at recognizing new active metabolites.']"
2016-02-19T00:00:00Z,Chemical Tools of Octopus maya during Crab Predation Are Also Active on Conspecifics,"['The PSG crude extract obtained was active over many species of crabs. The PSG aqueous extract presented two main activities: a metabolic effect exerted by molecules of > 3 kDa (probably trypsin and chymotrypsin), and a neurotoxic action (molecules < 3kDa) with paralysis and body relaxation. The bioguided separation of the neurotoxic fraction yields a paralyzing fraction with free amino acids as the principal components, whereas a relaxing fraction acts through serotonin. Interestingly, free amino acids were integrated into the feeding behavior. The neurotoxic fraction was active on O. maya conspecifics, leaving octopus as prey defenseless against predators and corroborating its likely importance in relation to cannibalistic events. The feeding behavior of O. maya when offered crabs and crown conchs is similar to that observed in other cephalopods. Although the radula was present and active, there was no evidence of its use to drill into crabs. Given that hole-boring is a time-consuming task, its absence here suggests that O. maya uses a time-minimizing strategy when hunting for this type of prey.Octopus maya is abundant on the Yucatan Peninsula and its diet primarily consists of several species of crabs that are also abundant in that area. Although octopuses have developed strategies to prey upon mollusks, these strategies may not be used as frequently as expected on less abundant gastropods. The paralyzing effect of salivary fluids suggests that octopuses are adapted to predation on crabs with defensive structures.']"

Although these pathogens are ancient in Western Europe, diet and insalubrity could be the cause of or could have contributed to maintaining ascariasis, trichuriasis or tapeworm disease in soldiers, whereas the presence of infected animals, in particular rodents, surrounding humans could probably explain the case of capillariasis, as already observed during the Neolithic period [36], [38]. It remains to be established whether humans were truly infected or simply acted as a transitory host. In this study, the multiple sources of contamination may reflect the poor living conditions of the combatants and the lack of knowledge of parasitic diseases at the beginning of the last century. Studying parasites in such a modern context reminds us how parasitology knowledge is recent, but also how living conditions and parasite nosology have evolved over the past decades.The identification of ancient parasites based on egg observation is difficult and sometimes impossible. In the case of capillariids, the comparative study of the eggshell ornamentation coupled with a statistical approach provided an appropriate solution to improve identification. Microscopy and micromorphology also appear to be a satisfactory temporary alternative to molecular analyses, which is not always applicable due to the lack of genomic data for some parasite groups. Spurred on by such tools, future paleoparasitological investigations should contribute to a better understanding of parasite cycles, history and evolution.']"
2013-12-23T00:00:00Z,De Novo Lipogenesis and Cholesterol Synthesis in Humans with Long-Standing Type 1 Diabetes Are Comparable to Non-Diabetic Individuals,"['The present work indicates that lipid synthesis is not significantly different in individuals with long-standing and labile type 1 diabetes compared to health non-diabetic adults. First, the data suggests lipogenesis is not elevated in type 1 diabetic individuals and likely is not a major contributor to circulating or stored triglyceride levels in these subjects, in contrast to other patient groups also at elevated risk of vascular disease, such as type 2 diabetes and NAFLD. Indeed, fatty acids arising from diet and stored adipose tissue may have a greater influence on hepatic metabolism in type 1 diabetes than in other populations where insulin resistance profoundly elevates lipogenesis as a significant source of fatty acids in the liver. Second, the finding of cholesterol synthesis and plasma cholesterol levels in type 1 diabetic individuals with poor glycemic control that are comparable to healthy non-diabetic individuals suggests that the routine use of statin medication for CVD reduction in this group should be evaluated within the context of other treatment options available which may instead modify cholesterol absorption, such as ezetimibe or plant sterols. In conclusion, the data indicates that metabolic risk in type 1 diabetic subjects may be beneficially managed by a combination of dietary and pharmaceutical interventions. Future research is required to delineate the possible interplay of lipogenesis, free fatty acid metabolism, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in this group, as well as the investigation of alternative cholesterol-lowering treatments in this group for prophylaxis of vascular disease.']"
2017-06-30T00:00:00Z,Modulating glioma-mediated myeloid-derived suppressor cell development with sulforaphane,"['Understanding the mechanisms of glioblastoma and cancer induced immunosuppression are key to developing effective immunotherapies. In this study, we have demonstrated a simple method for generating large amounts of immunosuppressive MDSCs by culturing normal monocytes in glioma-conditioned media. This method can be used for further mechanistic studies to understand the factors driving MDSC function and accumulation. Our cytokine array data suggests a number of potential secreted factors that may play a role in MDSC accumulation in GBM. MIF, an abundant cytokine in three unique human glioma conditioned medias, may play a role in mMDSC formation as an MIF neutralizing antibody negates the effect of GCM on monocytes. MIF has tautomerase activity which has been linked to its functional activity and is inhibited by the phytochemical sulforaphane. Sulforaphane inhibits the formation of mMDSCs in vitro when monocytes are exposed to glioma conditioned media, decreases their expression of immunosuppressive PD-L1, and drives them towards a mature dendritic cell phenotype which promotes T-cell proliferation. Sulforaphane has additional activity directly against glioma cells directly at concentrations that are not toxic to normal monocytes and lymphocytes and can be achieved in serum through oral administration. Sulforaphane is available through a normal diet from cruciferous vegetables, can be administered orally as a supplement or drug, and has low toxicity in humans. It is thus attractive for further investigation in GBM patients as an immunomodulatory agent and/or for its direct anti-tumor effects.']"
2017-11-17T00:00:00Z,Health effects of saturated and trans-fatty acid intake in children and adolescents: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"['Advice to reduce saturated fat intake of children results in a significant reduction in total and LDL-cholesterol levels as well as diastolic blood pressure without adverse effects. Results of this review suggest that the greatest effect on cholesterol occurred when SFA was replaced with PUFA or a mixture of PUFA/MUFA, although benefit was observed even when replacement was unclear. Results further suggest that the greatest reduction in cholesterol occurred when SFA intake was less than 10% of total energy intake. Elevated cholesterol has been linked to CVD in adults and preclinical markers of atherosclerosis in children, thus reducing saturated fat intake from an early age may help to reduce the risk of CVD later in life. CVD is a major contributor to the substantial global economic burden of NCDs. Projected increases in NCDs over the next two decades could cost up to 75% of global gross domestic product (GDP) as a result of healthcare costs and lost productivity due to death or disability.[64] Interventions targeting reduction in saturated fat intakes amongst children and adolescents could translate into major cost savings by reducing risk of CVD. Interventions should focus on reducing intakes of highly processed fried and nutrient-poor fast foods and snacks, processed meats and fatty meats. High-fibre fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, lean meats and reduced fat dairy foods should be the core components of children’s diets.']"
2015-02-23T00:00:00Z,Response of Benthic Foraminifera to Organic Matter Quantity and Quality and Bioavailable Concentrations of Metals in Aveiro Lagoon (Portugal),"['Polluted sediment in the form of both organic matter and metals can be found in the most confined zones of Ria de Aveiro. Whereas pollution by organic matter can lead to a growth in foraminifera density, when biopolymer concentrations of high quality increase, the rise of available metal concentrations causes a decline in foraminifera density and diversity.Species such as E. margaritaceum, P. mediterranensis, Q. seminula, E. williamsoni, G. praegeri, C. ungerianus and L. lobatula are sensitive to pollution caused by organic matter and metals, whereas A. tepida and E. excavatum are tolerant to pollution by organic matter and metals. This is even the case in low oxic environments where pH values are relatively high. A. mexicana, T. inflata, E. macrescens, T. comprimata and M. fusca respond positively to the increase of available concentrations of Zn, As, Cu and Hg, but avoid Pb, as do A. tepida and E. excavatum. Meanwhile, more sensitive species to metal enhancement, such as Q. seminula, B. ordinaria, B. pseudoplicata and B. elegantissima, tolerate pollution by Pb.Despite the fact that many species may not directly feed on biopolymers and may have a diversified diet, our results indicate that some may take advantage in environments enriched in, for instance: i) proteins, A. tepida; ii) lipids, H. germanica and S. lobata; and iii) carbohydrates, E. excavatum, T. inflata, E. macrescens, T. comprimata, A. mexicana and M. fusca.The environmental stress does not reach the critical threshold in Aveiro Lagoon, since foraminifera are not barren in the most confined and polluted zones.']"
2019-07-25T00:00:00Z,Microbiome evolution during host aging,"['The interactions between the host and its commensal microbes reach homeostatic balance during youth and adulthood, resisting insults from several external factors, including pathogens. Perturbations to this homeostatic balance can derive from changes in the environment, in diet, and from exposure to drugs such as antibiotics. However, challenges to the host–microbiota balance can also derive from intrinsic factors within the host, i.e., from the vast constellation of alterations that occur during the aging process, including cellular senescence, inflammation, and cancer. On the other hand, microbe–microbe interactions within the host could in principle also lead to host–microbiota disbalance, which could in turn contribute to host aging. Whether the microbiota adapt to the physiological changes occurring during host aging, or whether they actively participate to host dysfunction, remains an important open question. Understanding host–microbiota dynamics during host aging will critically inform future therapeutic interventions. If the microbiota exacerbate the cellular, tissue, and systemic changes that occur during host aging, then targeting the microbiota could, in theory, help therapeutically relieve some of the aging-related pathologies but would, in principle, not impact systemic aging. On the other hand, if the microbiota causally participate in triggering host aging, then interventions that target the microbiota could result in systemic, preventative, and bona fide anti-aging interventions.']"
2016-08-25T00:00:00Z,Food Environments around American Indian Reservations: A Mixed Methods Study,"['This study enhances our understanding of the food environment surrounding tribal areas. In particular, our adjusted analyses suggest that the disparity in food availability for tribal areas compared to non-tribal areas in California is not entirely due to urbanicity and per capita income. Additionally, our qualitative analysis suggests that individuals living in tribal areas perceive significant barriers to the acquisition of healthy food. A better understanding the food environment surrounding tribal areas is critical given the potential role of those environments in the disproportionate burden of obesity and diabetes among American Indian populations. This research suggests that interventions to improve diet-related health outcomes in these communities should consider the structural barriers to access faced by many populations living on or near tribal lands. In addition, when considering policy initiatives to improve food environments so that all populations have access to healthy, affordable foods, Native American tribal lands should be prioritized. Additionally, tribal communities can use this information to identify barriers to the attainment of healthy food as a potential need to be addressed in their communities. This recognition can lead to innovative community-led solutions to prioritize healthy food access in underserved areas. Further research to better describe and understand the food environments surrounding tribal areas should include more precise measurements of food quality to capture intra-categorical differences of food outlets and a broadly representative qualitative sample to help contextualize the data.']"
2018-12-18T00:00:00Z,An exploration of reported food intake among inmates who gained body weight during incarceration in Canadian federal penitentiaries,"['In conclusion, inmates are vulnerable to weight gain while incarcerated in Canadian penitentiaries probably in part because of the food they eat (or do not eat). Inmates who gained the most weight reported lower healthy food consumption (vegetables, fruit, legumes, cereal, dairy and legumes). Inversely, inmates who gained less weight reported eating those healthy foods daily. Given food intake is a modifiable risk factor for weight gain during incarceration, the findings from our study could help decision makers when choosing how to feed inmates, and which foods to have available to them. The commissary store (or “canteen”) appears to be more influential on weight gain than the food provided by food services (run by Correctional Service Canada). Making the commissary (or “canteen”) an efficient target for weight loss interventions or a means to improve the food environment in prison. Further research could examine the effectiveness of interventions aimed at increasing healthy food consumption through the commissary store (or “canteen”). An analysis of existing interventions in the community could be helpful to see what could be adapted to the prison environment. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis of the modified diets provided to inmates with special dietary needs and beliefs could also provide more insight into weight gain during incarceration.']"

Other studies have previously investigated the effects of genetic variation, age and sex using an identical or higher-throughput Illumina platform. However, this is the first study that has examined such factors in a Mexican American population. We have demonstrated here, further evidence supporting a role for genetic effects on DNA methylation, by replicating previous findings and presenting new data. Although several of our findings overlap with previous studies, the identification of novel CpG loci that are heritable, regulated by genetic variation, or that are influenced by age and sex may suggest the existence of ethnic-specific factors that drive regulation of DNA methylation. Such novel findings could also suggest that currently published studies, as well as our own, may be underpowered in their ability to detect true associations or have generated false positive results due to small sample sizes. Differences that are seen across studies could also be due to environmental effects, some of which may themselves be ethnic- or population-specific (e.g. different diets, residential areas). We also provide nominal evidence that DNA methylation may be implicated in obesity in Mexican Americans, however additional follow up studies, particularly in a larger population are required to fully assess such implications.']"

European perspective on benefits and challenges associated with cross-border health communication campaigns,"['This study investigated the challenges in planning and operationalising cross-national health communication campaigns in Europe. Despite its European focus, the findings are instructive for cross-national communication campaigns for the prevention of chronic diseases carried out in other regional contexts. Gathering insight through expert focus groups organised around the four main risk factors for chronic diseases (smoking, alcohol consumption, sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy diet), it is evident that while cross-national campaigns have explicit advantages, they must address national and sub-national variations across a range of dimensions if they are to be successful. These include primarily epidemiological, cultural, and legislative differences. In order to do so, a keen awareness and focus on the local context is needed. This entails the active inclusion of local actors in the design, planning and implementation phases of campaigns. That said, deciding which roles and tasks should be decentralised and which should be centralised within higher levels of governance remains a delicate and balancing act. Further research is needed into transferability of know-how from local/national to cross-national settings, and into balancing standardised components of a cross-national campaign with locally adapted ones. A key caveat remains that isolated from legislative action, cross-national communication campaigns are limited in their potential to produce a long-term effect on behaviours and therefore health outcomes. We therefore encourage further studies to explore the two issues in conjunction.']"
2018-09-07T00:00:00Z,Cariogenic potential of sweet flavors in electronic-cigarette liquids,"['A novel finding of this study is that certain e-liquid ingredients interact with hard tissues of the oral cavity in such a way that resembles high-sucrose candies and acidic drinks that adversely affect teeth. This is an important finding that suggests the complexity of e-cigarettes on human health goes beyond respiratory and cardiac systems and may have significant implications on oral health. It is a common perception among e-cigarette users that vaping is less harmful or is without health risk. Though it is acknowledged here that e-cigarette aerosols contain less harmful and potentially harmful constituents compared to combustible tobacco products, the data suggests e-cigarettes produce viscous aerosols that change surface characteristics and have biological consequences. Viscous e-liquids made from propylene glycol and glycerin, along with sweet flavors facilitate attachment and provide additional food source which pathogenic oral bacteria such as S. mutans prefer. Youth and young adults are a uniquely vulnerable population to dental caries due to their high-sucrose diet and poor to minimal oral hygiene practice [87–90]. This study suggests that flavored e-cigarette products negatively affect teeth and pose potential oral health risk. These two facts advocate that there is an urgent need to further research e-cigarettes, e-liquids and flavors in the context of human health and disease.']"
2018-06-20T00:00:00Z,Convergent evolution of a mobile bony tongue in flighted dinosaurs and pterosaurs,"['Trends in the evolution of tongue structure in archosaurs lie in stark contrast to those observed in lepidosaurs (tuatara, lizards and snakes), taxa that commonly informed early reconstructions of charismatic extinct forms, such as dinosaurs. In lepidosaurs, which show remarkable diversity in hyoid shape, there remains a primary respiratory function for the hyoid elements. The hyobranchial elements (multiple sets of ceratobranchials) show a primarily dorsoventral movement that is deployed during buccal pumping [35]. The hyoid structure shows strong muscular links to the pectoral girdle that are lost in archosaurs [18] and any tongue protrusion is via attached fleshy extensions rather than bony components [1]. In Archosauria, the evolution of novel respiratory mechanisms apparently drove a simplification of the tongue [18] that was retained in most taxa. Only with the evolution of flight (birds and pterosaurs) and in select quadrupedal herbivores was tongue structure elaborated. Shifts in locomotor mode appear to introduce novel selective pressures on food manipulation during feeding and linked changes in diet. While mostly carnivorous non-avian dinosaurs elaborate dentition, extant birds show complex, functionally-linked diversity in rostral shape and tongue structure. Why this appears to be exclusively seen within extant birds (primarily Neognathae) to the exclusion of pterosaurs and other dinosaurs is unexplained. To explore why living birds show such trends, we may need to explore body size dynamics, the diversification of flowering plants or the diversity dynamics of potential prey.']"
2008-02-29T00:00:00Z,Parallels between Pathogens and Gluten Peptides in Celiac Sprue,"['Infectious pathogens adapt to and cause disease in a particular host by evolving virulence traits that provide a context-specific, selective advantage to the pathogen (e.g., by enabling it to breach a specific host epithelial barrier, or by facilitating its dispersal via induction of diarrhea) [209]. By contrast, it is difficult to imagine how the ability of immunotoxic gluten peptides to resist gastrointestinal proteolysis, to exert damaging stress on epithelial cells, to be specifically deamidated by TG2, or to engage in high affinity HLA DQ2 binding affords any increase in fitness to the grains encoding these peptides. Nonetheless, gluten peptides possess all of these attributes, each of which is a de facto virulence trait essential toward the pathogenesis of celiac sprue. Moreover, these peptides persist as human pathogens uniquely due to our purposeful cultivation of the grains that produce them, and our quite intentional exposure to them by way of diet. Gluten peptides, then, are quintessentially accidental pathogens that cause disease in the most obliging of hosts.Consequently, the eradication of celiac sprue as a human disease is achievable through widespread adoption of natural or engineered strains of wheat, rye, and barley with less toxic properties. Unless and until this occurs, non-dietary therapies are needed to safeguard celiac sprue patients trying to maintain a gluten-free diet in the midst of ubiquitous gluten. Such therapies require a solid understanding of the mechanisms by which immunotoxic gluten peptides cause disease, and of the factors that render afflicted individuals susceptible. Many questions remain to be answered before we can claim such complete knowledge. First, celiac sprue exhibits features of chronic inflammatory, genetic, autoimmune, and pathogen-induced diseases, but the respective etiological contributions of each are uncertain. It is not clear, for instance, whether anti-TG2 autoantibodies advance pathogenesis, or if they are merely bystanders in the humoral response. Genetic predisposition for disease is clearly imparted by HLA DQ2, but 60% of the genetic risk for celiac sprue remains unattributed. A genetically tractable animal model will greatly facilitate the search for these unknown disease determinants, possibly identifying genes involved in intestinal permeability and innate immunity. Still other players involved in disease progression are known, but their site of action is not. For example, it is not clear where the selective deamidation of ingested gluten peptides occurs. Likewise, the antigen-presenting cells that present DQ2-bound gluten to CD4+ T cells in the lamina propria remain to be definitively identified. A major outlying question concerns the provenance of the inflammatory immune response. Celiac sprue is widely regarded as a T cell–mediated inflammatory disease, but the discovery of an IL-15-mediated innate response to gluten calls into question whether adaptive immunity alone can cause disease. Importantly, both the immunogenic 33-mer and the innate p31–49 peptide induce characteristic villous flattening and increased IEL infiltration when administered alone to celiac patients [210,211]. Here again, the reconstitution of celiac sprue in a suitable animal model will be critical toward clarifying which processes are necessary and sufficient to provoke disease. Finally, the most important question in celiac sprue research is how we can apply our knowledge of its pathogenesis toward the development of an effective non-dietary treatment, and thereby improve the quality of life for patients living with the disease.']"
2014-01-31T00:00:00Z,Pastoralism in Northern Peru during Pre-Hispanic Times: Insights from the Mochica Period (100–800 AD) Based on Stable Isotopic Analysis of Domestic Camelids,"['The present study underlines the adaptive capacities of the Mochica people to their environment. Irrigation allowed for the development of extensive agriculture in a very arid environment. Herders also adapted their practices to this difficult environment. This study also emphasizes the role of maize in different aspects of Mochica economic life. Further work will be conducted on Mochica camelids from different valleys to confirm these first results and to compare herding practices on a regional scale. Strong relationships might have been established between two major religious centers, such as the Huacas de Moche and El Brujo, and their hinterlands. A better understanding of these relationships is required in order to describe how herd management was spatially organized. Camelids from domestic contexts should also be analysed to compare them with camelids from ritual contexts, to determine whether or not they have the same origin and to gain insights into meat exchange in the different Andean ecozones. Our study also indicates that diversity in herding practices existed in the lowlands, as already described for higher altitudes, even though only animals with similar functions (funerary and ritual) were analysed. Species-specific identification of llamas and alpacas was not possible from the osteological study of archaeological remains. This would, however, provide a better understanding of the relation between camelid functions and herding practices.An increasing number of studies have used stable isotopic analyses to document camelid diet and herding practices in Peru, Chile and Argentina, during the pre-Hispanic period [34], [128]–[129], [139]–[141]. Together with the data presented in this study, these analyses have identified variations in the geographic locations of camelid breeding and pastureland and/or foddering practices outside the modern geographic range. Our work underscores regional and temporal variations in Andean pastoralism and disparity with the classical model of vertical exchange. Most previously published studies were performed on bone tissue and make no reference to the age of the sampled individuals. Because of the remodeling of bone tissue, age is essential for reconstructing the individual life history of each specimen and for identifying the place of birth. The serial analysis of tooth enamel brings new information on camelid pastoralism and complements bone collagen analysis. The combined analysis of different tissues, which form at different times, enables us to detect potential diachronic change in diet and geographical location throughout an animal’s life. Besides, tooth enamel is better preserved over time than bone collagen. The poor quality of preservation of bone collagen in the Moche Valley was also observed for human remains at Cerro Oreja [135]. Moreover, enamel analysis offers the opportunity to independently assess the geographic habitat of organisms through climate records. δ18Oenamel values provide some information but inferences are limited so far because the environmental and biological factors that might influence δ18Oenamel values need to be better understood. The influence of the circulation of surface water that might mask the difference in δ18Oe w values between ecological zones, breastfeeding and milk consumption are some of the factors that have to be documented. The duration of tooth mineralization in domestic camelids would also need to be determined. Finally, a more precise reconstruction of the geographic location of pastureland and mobility is expected from the combination of the measurement of δ13C, δ15N and δ18Oenamel values with 87Sr/86Sr values.']"
2019-09-06T00:00:00Z,"Skull remains of the dinosaur Saturnalia tupiniquim (Late Triassic, Brazil): With comments on the early evolution of sauropodomorph feeding behaviour","['Part of the osteology of the Carnian (Late Triassic) dinosaur Saturnalia has been described in a series of papers [3,7,15,38,58]. Here we provide the first detailed description of the only skull cover elements known for the taxon (Fig 15), which belong to one of the paratypes (MCP-3845-PV), filling a gap on our knowledge on the anatomy of this taxon. The newly described material provides stronger support for the inference that Saturnalia possesses a reduced skull, typical of later sauropodomorphs. Furthermore, when this information is analysed alongside other aspects, including dental and brain-tissues anatomy, it suggests that the initial skull reduction of sauropodomorphs might have been indeed associated with an increase in efficiency of a predatory lifestyle as previously suggested [33].\n10.1371/journal.pone.0221387.g015\nFig 15\n\nReconstruction of the skull of Saturnalia tupiniquim in lateral (A) and dorsal (B) views, with preserved bones highlighted in green.\nAbbreviations: anf—antorbital fenestra; bo—basioccipital; d—dentary; emf—external mandibulary fenestra; en—external naris; f—frontal; l—lacrimal; lt—laterosphenoid; ltf—laterotemporal fenestra; m—maxilla; orb—orbit; p—parietal; po—postorbital; pp—paroccipital process; prf—prefrontal; q—quadrate; so—supraoccipital; sq—squamosal; stf—supratemporal fenestra.\n\n\nThe description presented here will be source for future phylogenetic and/or comparative studies dealing with the early evolution of dinosaurs and sauropodomorphs. The results of the two phylogenetic analyses highlight the uncertainty on the relations among Carnian sauropodomorphs, with the hypotheses showing differences on the affinity of taxa such as Buriolestes, Chromogisaurus, Eoraptor, Pampadromaeus, Panphagia, and Saturnalia (see also [26]). Thus, the hypothesis that features associated with the acquisition of a more omnivorous/herbivorous diet appeared in a stepwise fashion among sauropodomorphs does not fit to all possible phylogenetic scenarios. Nevertheless, the dental anatomy of Saturnalia adds evidence that the group achieved a relatively broad ecomorphological disparity in the Carnian, what might explain their higher diversity when compared to other dinosaur groups in the oldest dinosaur-bearing strata in South America.Based on the new data from Saturnalia and other recently discovered taxa, the early evolution of the sauropodomorph diet can be traced in more detail. Carnian sauropodomorphs show great variety in tooth morphology, but still seemingly correspond to at least partially faunivorous taxa. One exception is the recently discovered Bagualosaurus [11], the tooth and postcranial anatomy (i.e. increase in body size) of which shows that a shift to a more herbivorous lifestyle have happened still during the Carnian. Our PCoA analysis reveals marked shifts in the morphology of the jaw features associated with the feeding behaviour through time. These shifts are ultimately linked to transformations in the postcranial anatomy (see also [9,10]), and highlight that the first 55 million years of sauropodomorph evolution, from the Late Triassic (Carnian–c. 230 Ma) to the last stages of the Early Jurassic (Toarcian–c. 175 Ma), were marked by important changes in the ecomorphology of the group.']"
2015-06-17T00:00:00Z,The Geographic Distribution of a Tropical Montane Bird Is Limited by a Tree: Acorn Woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus) and Colombian Oaks (Quercus humboldtii) in the Northern Andes,"['Our results support the hypothesis that a biotic interaction with an important food resource limits a tropical bird’s large-scale geographic distribution. Tropical species have been hypothesized to inhabit distributions largely shaped by biotic interactions [57]. However, few studies have marshaled quantitative evidence that biotic interactions limit distributions of tropical species [58–60], and the influence of biotic interactions with important food resources on the distributional limits of tropical birds has seldom been previously considered in a species distribution modeling framework (but see [24]). It is especially intriguing that Acorn Woodpeckers in the Northern Andes are apparently limited by the presence of Colombian oaks despite their generalist diet—tropical populations of Acorn Woodpeckers flycatch for insects, drink sap, consume acorns, fruit, grains and eat an array of insects [30,61]. Thus, although Acorn Woodpeckers in Colombia can occur at sites where oaks are absent [30], and tropical populations of Acorn Woodpeckers do not store acorns in large granary trees as do North American populations [30,62], oaks appear to be a sufficiently important food resource that they influence Acorn Woodpecker distribution at a broad geographic scale, perhaps because Acorn Woodpeckers regularly drink sap from Colombian oak trees [30]. Further studies should investigate Acorn Woodpecker diet in the Northern Andes. Regardless, our results suggest that a biotic interaction with oaks limits Acorn Woodpecker broad geographic distribution but may not influence local patterns of abundance and distribution within the northern Andes, a reversal of the commonly noted pattern that biotic interactions influence local patterns of abundance and distribution but not broad geographic patterns [3].We conclude with a call for further case studies to test whether biotic interactions influence large-scale distributional limits (e.g., [22–25]). Such studies are especially appropriate in birds, where reciprocal transplant experiments to experimentally assess the impact of biotic interactions on distributional limits are nearly impossible, but voluminous distributional data facilitates construction of species distribution models to explore how biotic interactions impact species’ distributional limits. Acorn Woodpeckers may be extreme in their apparent reliance on a particular species of tree as a food resource. However, we suggest that many tropical birds may inhabit distributions that are limited more by the presence of single plant species that are important food resources than by abiotic climatic factors. For example, a number of tropical bird species are specialized on bamboo seeds (Neotropics; [63]: Asian tropics;[64]: Melanesia; [65]; these birds likely inhabit distributions limited more by bamboo distribution than by climatic factors [66]. Similar scenarios may apply to other specialist foragers, such as Phaethornis hermits (hummingbirds) that forage primarily on Heliconia flowers [67], or the Giant Conebill (Oreomanes fraseri) and Point-tailed Palmcreeper (Berlepschia rikeri) that are tightly associated with, respectively, high-elevation Polylepis forests in the Andes and Mauritia palm groves in the Amazon [29]. Future research will determine the extent to which biotic interactions with plants that provide important food sources structure distributions of tropical montane birds.']"
2014-11-05T00:00:00Z,Snout Shape in Extant Ruminants,"['Using a two-dimensional representation of the ruminant snout in ventral aspect, we have demonstrated that there is a strong relationship between snout shape and feeding ecology within a highly diverse sample of the major ruminant clades, but only when the data set is restricted to members of the relatively well-defined browser and grazer classes. This between-group discrimination is statistically robust, and supported by recent analyses of the relationship between diet and the shape of the anterior dentary [43]. Snout shape variation is shown to be strongly controlled by phylogenetic similarity, but with this phylogenetic component not affecting the overall dispersal patterns of snout shapes in discriminant space and proportion of successful categorisations. Snout shape variation is also found to be strongly correlated to body size, although this relationship breaks down in a phylogenetically controlled comparison. This corroborates previous hypotheses of relations between feeding style, body size, and ecology, and that while evolutionary similarity is an important component of ecology, snout shape appears to reflect a genuine functional signal.Based on our results, it is further apparent that previous categorisations, which included putative ‘intermediates’, or ‘unknowns’ here, of snout shapes relative to feeding strategy are not fully adequate in their depictions of the full range of exhibited morphological variation (i.e., ‘browsers’ do not strictly have ‘pointed’ premaxillae, and ‘grazers’ do not just have ‘blunt’ premaxillae as asserted previously by many authors). The geometric complexity of premaxilla morphology is more extensive than this and forms a continuum of shape variation within the modern ruminant fauna. Our results suggest that attempts to place thresholds on other related factors involved in feeding are problematic and quantitative testing is required a priori (following the recommendations of Gordon and Illius, [34]).In light of these results, inferences made by Janis et al. [92] - that intake rate forces covariation in the anatomical strength of the mandible - could be explored further to determine the relationship between grazing and browsing ruminants and the relative robustness of the masticatory apparatus. We suggest, in a manner analogous to that of Codron et al. [46], that ruminant diets represent a continuum with variation explicitly occurring on a spatiotemporal (geographical and seasonal) scale for all feeding strategies. This requires additional analysis in terms of ruminant phylogenetic affinity, [98], [99], [100], species’ ranges, and functionally significant ecological parameters. Additionally, the role of different ecological categories based on dietary strategies could be explored beyond the traditional browser-intermediate-grazer trichotomy, such as that for African bovids by Gagnon and Chew [101].The fact that feeding style-based categories were demonstrated to be associated with snout shape in this investigation offers a model for future ecological studies regarding the reconstruction of palaeodiets using a morphometric dataset to delimit and identify extinct browsing and grazing species [36], [38]. This aspect of palaeoecology could feasibly be integrated with additional indicators of diet, such as isotopic signatures and microwear in teeth [99], [100], [102], or the hypsodonty index [103]. Indeed, the incorporation of additional ecological predictors has been demonstrated to increase the accuracy of dietary classification [42].It is conceivable that our results are the product of a lack of consistency in the ecological definitions of functional feeding groups for ruminants – either in theory or in practice – with respect to other morphophysiological traits. The functional significance of snout shape in relation to bite size, intake rate, body size and selectivity was not addressed explicitly by our investigation. Indeed, our results indicate that closer inspection of these relationships is required. Quantitative metrics describing these ecologically significant parameters should provide a firmer basis for these in (anticipated) future studies [97].What is undoubtedly necessary in future studies is the dissection of recovered signals to determine what proportion of trait covariation can be explained by phylogenetic relationships [94], [95]. Applicable methods include comparative phylogenetic modelling, which has gained increasing interest in the integration of ecology and macroevolution (e.g., [95], [104]), and demonstrated in the current study in the context of multivariate statistics. This will facilitate the teasing apart of genuine adaptational signals as opposed to morphological similarity based on common ancestry. Calculation of the rates and direction of snout shape evolution in ruminants, while incorporating fossil data, will be important in elucidating the ecological history of ruminants. Furthermore, if singular or multiple functional traits are found to be phylogenetic artefacts, it may be possible to track the sequence of acquisition, and therefore trace the macroevolutionary and ecological coevolution of ruminants. However, the results obtained here suggest that while phylogeny exhibits a strong control on snout shape in ruminants, it does not affect their ecological classification. Indeed, snout shape and profile-based classification can be explained by a combination of phylogenetic similarity and evolutionary history, body size, and ecology. Finally, in addition to phylogeny, factors such as ontogeny and range size should be scrutinised within a similarly rigorous morphometric-statistical framework to detect potential allometric variation, possible synchronisation of trait acquisition, and evolutionary patterns of character acquisition that might differ between sexes.']"
2015-04-02T00:00:00Z,Altered Circadian Rhythm and Metabolic Gene Profile in Rats Subjected to Advanced Light Phase Shifts,"['Organisms have strong advantages when their biological rhythms match and maintain a phase relationship with the environmental cycles. The circadian systems are linked to the light/dark and nutrient environment by a network of local tissue specific clocks in both the brain and periphery. This combination is achieved by a group of genes that act in feedback loops and integrate the circadian clock oscillations and metabolism [12]. Although there is evidence of the relation between circadian rhythm disruption and obesity, the mechanisms involved are unclear. The difficulties arise from the tissue specific action of the genes involved in circadian rhythm and metabolism, but also from several other factors, such as the nutrient status and meal timing, which by themselves alter the circadian system [14].In previous studies, animals treated with high-fat diet (HFD) showed a disruption in behavioural and molecular circadian rhythms, higher activity during the light phase, and an increase in food consumption [15]. In our case, we submitted young rats, fed with a standard diet, to 8 weeks of phase shifts (advances, delays and advances + delays). Body weight was maintained in all groups. This was not surprising since rats were fed normal chow and phase shifts were applied during a short period of time. Interestingly, at this time point serum glucose, insulin and leptin levels were already decreased but only in the advanced group. We thus hypothesized that the decrease of leptin could induce orexigenic neuropeptides in the hypothalamus and be the first signal of possible alterations at the transcriptional level in metabolic pathways. We cannot rule out that the other groups of rats submitted to phase shifts (delays and advances + delays) might also have manifested some alterations in metabolism. However, we decided to focus on the analysis of the group that was most likely to show alterations: the advanced group, which shows the most altered rhythm. Leptin acts as a satiety signal and inhibits NPY and AgRP [16]. The mRNA levels of both neuropeptides increased in the hypothalamus in the advanced group. This fits with the low levels of leptin observed in the advanced group and suggests modifications in the regulation of feeding. Other studies based on sleep time restriction also showed altered leptin levels in WAT resulting in deregulation of adipose metabolism [17]. Chronic advances produce dissociation in the circadian system, which implies that rats may also feed in the light period [18][19]. Although the feeding pattern and body temperature was not measured in our study, alterations in food intake may underpin alterations in serum glucose, insulin, and leptin. Thus, the discrepancy between light-dark cycles and food intake might have contributed to the alterations (i.e. insulin or leptin) found in our study. Further experiments should clarify what would happen under chronic phase advances and food restricted to darkness.The rhythmic behaviour of the chronic advanced group was different from the rest. This group showed most alterations in the manifestation of the motor activity rhythm, resembling the pattern observed when rats were submitted to LD cycles with a period shorter than 24h with the presence of two simultaneous circadian rhythms with different period [20,21]. Since chronic delays produced only a single rhythm with a PV similar to that of controls, we suggest that the cause of the metabolic alterations are not the phase shifts by themselves but the dissociation of the circadian rhythm. Changes in both Bmal1 and Per2 mRNA levels in all tissues studied, at the onset of darkness (and onset of activity), of the advanced group compared with controls indicate an alteration of the circadian system. This coincides with other models of circadian disruption found with different phases shifts (e.g. rats submitted to LD mimicking the rotating shift-work with 8h phase delay every second day [22] or reversing the photoperiod every 3–4 days [23]).All our results are referred to the onset of darkness, which limits our experiment, since many metabolites have circadian expression throughout the day. The lack of variation in cholesterol, triacylglycerides and NEFA serum levels of the advanced group may have been due to the serum collection time (2h after the start of the dark phase) and is consistent with the findings of Pan et al. [24]. These authors showed that triacylglicerides and cholesterol levels did not change in clock deficient mice at the onset of the dark phase. In addition, we did not observe changes in FGF21 serum levels between control and the advanced group. Although we have seen a decrease in liver FGF21 mRNA levels, which is considered the main FGF21 secretory tissue, other metabolic tissues such as WAT, BAT, skeletal muscle and pancreas might have contributed to the lack of differences in FGF21 serum levels [25,26]. Moreover, other changes seen in the present study such as the differences in BAT weight are unlikely to vary throughout the day. The advanced group showed a decrease in glucose levels, which could mean an initial alteration of glucose metabolism due to chronic phase shifting. While some studies in Bmal1 knockout mice showed alterations in glucose metabolism [27,28], a recent paper based on Bmal1 knockout mice did not report glucose alterations in serum [29]. It has been observed that Clock and Bmal1 knockouts in mouse pancreas produced hypoinsulinaemia and diabetes [30]. Although the expression of BMAL1 increased in the advanced group of rats, we hypothesize that either up- or down-regulation of the circadian rhythm genes may affect insulin production and signalling. Thus, despite serum insulin was decreased, Glut4 was overexpressed in WAT, suggesting a deregulation of the insulin signalling pathway.PPARα is involved in fatty acid oxidation and regulates FGF21 production in the liver. Fasting or mice treatment with the PPARα agonist Wy-14,643 induces FGF21 mRNA expression [31][32]. On the contrary, PPARα deficient mice showed decreased FGF21 mRNA levels and fasting or PPARα agonist treatment did not induce FGF21 mRNA expression [32]. Although both control and the advanced group of rats were fasted for 8–10h before sacrifice, the advanced group showed a decrease in liver Fgf21 and Pparα suggesting a predisposition to obesity. It is worth noticing that the same factors that decreased in liver, increased in WAT, indicating tissue specificity.In rats subjected to advanced phase shifts, BAT mass was increased and histological examination showed a brown-to-white transformation with lipid accumulation. The expression of the BAT differentiation marker Ucp1 decreased as well as that of Fgf21, which is expressed during thermogenic activation [25]. Moreover, Cpt1B mRNA expression was decreased, indicating reduced lipid oxidation. BAT is present and active in adult humans and decreases in obesity and type 2 diabetes [33]. Brown adipocytes enhance energy expenditure, increasing glucose and fatty acid uptake. Thus, activation of BAT might be a potential tool to counter obesity [34]. According to this, the loss of BAT differentiation in the advanced group of animals reflects an initial state of obesity.The expression of lipid metabolic genes in WAT was strongly altered in the advanced group. Lipid oxidation (Cpt1B, Fgf21, Pparα and Pgc1α) and synthesis (Srebp1C, Fas and Agpat2) were increased. Pparα has been implicated in obesity and metabolic diseases [14] while Pgc1α plays an important role in the crosstalk between circadian clock circuitry and metabolism [35]. It is noteworthy that in previous studies animals treated with HFD showed a decrease in WAT BMAL1 and SIRT1 [36], while in our case animals were under chow diet and both were up-regulated. This indicates that the consequences of diet in lipid metabolism are different from the effects produced by circadian rhythm alterations.Metabolic syndrome is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation and increased ER and ROS damage [37]. Inflammation has also been reported in the hypothalamus at the initial state of obesity [38]. Our results show that the expression of markers of inflammation and ER stress were increased in WAT (Inos and Pdi) and hypothalamus (Inos) of advanced rats.In summary, our experiments showed alterations in metabolic, inflammatory and ER stress factors in young animals submitted to chronic advanced phase shifts without diet manipulations such as restricted feeding or HFD. Our study also questions the ability of young subjects to cope with phase shifts and highlights the role of stable circadian rhythms in the prevention of metabolic diseases. Although further studies in humans are necessary to extrapolate the present data, our results suggest the need to assess the direction of the shift work schedules in order to prevent metabolic alterations and their pathological consequences.']"
2017-04-11T00:00:00Z,Global trends in dietary micronutrient supplies and estimated prevalence of inadequate intakes,"['We estimated global micronutrient supplies at the national level of eight vitamins and six minerals, their bioavailability, and prevalence of inadequate intake, including an estimated Prevalence of Inadequate Micronutrient Intake Index (PIMII) and a Micronutrient Density Index (MDI). We found that the MDI has improved over the past 50 years in most regions, but it has declined in sub-Saharan Africa. The PIMII has declined in all regions during this period—although in sub-Saharan Africa it only started to decrease in 1990—due to increased total energy supplies and/or dietary micronutrient density. Increasing the availability of food energy supplies is still necessary for countries whose energy supplies fall short of their population’s requirements, and this may reduce both hunger and micronutrient deficiencies, although efforts to increase dietary micronutrient density should also be considered.Countries with adequate energy supplies but a high estimated prevalence of inadequate micronutrient intakes may benefit from a greater focus on increasing the nutrient density of the food supply through diversification, fortification, and biofortification; improving access to and utilization of nutrient-dense foods; and nutrition education. General approaches to reduce poverty and increase education, especially of women, are integral to sustainably addressing malnutrition in low- and middle-income countries. Our indices may be used on their own, or in conjunction with the Global Hunger Index [62] or specific anthropometric indicators such as stunting and wasting or overweight and obesity to understand spatial and temporal trends in malnutrition, dietary quality, and related health effects.']"
2018-04-03T00:00:00Z,Does growth path influence beef lipid deposition and fatty acid composition?,"['Results from the present study showed that growth path influences fatty acid metabolism with repercussions on longissimus thoracis muscle IMF composition, with beneficial effects on meat nutritional quality. When compared to continuous growth bulls, meat from the discontinuous group had greater levels of 18:1 isomers and lower levels of branched chain fatty acids, which could reveal an important impact of discontinuous growth on rumen microbial metabolism. Increased expression of genes associated with fatty acid beta-oxidation where shown during feed restrictionwhereasduring re-feeding predominate the expression of genes associated with fatty acid synthesis. This pattern can be observed in Alentejana bulls, after 9 months of compensatory growth,. When compared to continuous growth bulls some genes such as ELOVL5 and FASN, which have a key role in fatty acid syntheses and elongation, were up-regulated in discontinuous growth bulls. It was observed a clear trend on delta-9 desaturase activity indices, which were consistently higher in discontinuous bulls, suggesting an important effect of growth path on SCD1 and SCD5 mRNA levels. However, this was not associated to differences in the expression of both genes. As for others, it is possible that these genes may have an important role in fatty acid metabolism during refeeding but are no longer up-regulated at slaughter. These results contribute to the knowledge about the mechanisms involved in fatty acid metabolism during compensatory growth at a molecular level and could help to identify genomic biomarkers that can be used in the future in the selection of cattle used in traditional beef production systems in Mediterranean areas.']"

To address the factors associated with poor treatment outcomes revealed in our study, a systematic multi-pronged approach would be needed. Accordingly, since the time this analysis was conducted, RNTCP policies and interventions are built to address these factors and are being scaled-up in India. These are designed to detect DR-TB early with universal rapid molecular DST before multiple prolonged treatment exposures or before cavitary disease sets in; to treat all variants of DR-TB promptly with regimen designs guided by baseline SL-LPA triage for FQ and/or SLI resistance including shorter MDR-TB regimen (if susceptible to FQ and SLI) or longer DST guided regimen with newer drugs like Bedaquiline; to build systems for real-time DR-TB surveillance, decentralized counseling to promote adherence, nutritional assessment and supplementation to avert weight loss and influence of undernutrition and to prevent further emergence of DR-TB with transition to daily FDC regimen for DS-TB. However, highest political commitment to invest in a robust national strategic plan, systematic vigilant scale up of these new interventions with evidence guided course correction will remain the key to ending TB and DR-TB in India.']"
2017-12-27T00:00:00Z,Maternal metabolism affects endometrial expression of oxidative stress and FOXL2 genes in cattle,"['The present study has demonstrated that maternal metabolism rather than lactation perturbs endometrial function in cattle. ICAR areas have been identified as the endometrial regions more affected by perturbations in maternal metabolism in post-partum cows. We identified FOXL2 and oxidative stress-related enzymes as genes whose expression was modified by the absence of lactation. Based on our gene expression data in endometrial ICAR areas of these pregnant females, lactating cows were not significantly different from heifers whereas previously published analyses of circulating metabolites (insulin, IGF1, glucose, NEFA) in these same females indicated that lactating cows were distinct from heifers and dry cows during postpartum in the absence of pregnancy [39]. Pregnancy may have brought about modifications in expressed factors and biological functions in the endometrium of lactating cows that were not detected with our candidate gene approach. Certainly more genes and other biological functions in the endometrium are affected, and their identification prompts the need for more comprehensive molecular analyses of this tissue. Considering the driving property of the endometrium on the trajectory of embryo development [13], it appears critical to determine if molecular modifications detected at the endometrial level have an impact on conceptus features that have been shown to react to subtle modifications in dam energy metabolism [5]. These investigations may provide new approaches for nutritional strategies that could alleviate the negative impact of lactation on prenatal programming of adult performances when lactation and pregnancy overlap.']"
2019-05-07T00:00:00Z,Association between the time spent watching television and the sociodemographic characteristics with the presence of overweight and obesity in Colombian adolescents (secondary analysis of the ENSIN 2010),"['In conclusion, there is a significant prevalence of overweight and obesity among adolescents in Colombia. For overweight, the associated sociodemographic factors were: being a woman, high socioeconomic status, residing in an urban area, being an Indian, watching television and / or video games for three days in the last week and watching two or more hours of television and / or video games in one day. On the other hand, obesity is associated with sociodemographic factors such as: being a woman, medium socioeconomic level, medium-high and high, being Afro-Colombian, watching television and / or playing video games in the last seven days and watching television and / or video games for seven days during the last week. By adjusting the models by age and by all variables, overweight and obesity showed the same significant associations although with different values, being a woman, socioeconomic level III, IV or more and residing in an urban area.In searches of information made by the authors, it was observed that the present study shows the most current findings of overweight-obesity association with the time spent watching television and sociodemographic determinants in a representative sample of adolescents from Colombia. Overweight and obesity in adolescents could be addressed through the control of sociocultural behaviors, such as: the good use of new technologies; establish limits to watch television between 1 and 1.5 hours per day, especially on holidays; perform and / or increase the level of physical activity; decrease the consumption of products with high caloric content and low nutritional value, essentially, while watching television.']"

The models presented here have better predictive value (R2p) than the models prior work in small vessels (180 ml) batch cultures over 35-days with similar treatment factor combinations [20]. The sparsely sampled design space was allowed accurate modeling of complex relationships in fed-batch bioreactors. Prior work with SF bioreactors shows sucrose conversion to rhizome mass in turmeric can be scaled from batch to fed-batch over longer periods of time [14]. Similarly, NSF technique, 2.5 l vessels, and experimental designs used in this work could predict mineral use and optimal nutrition for larger-scale bioreactors.Potassium nitrate and P induce fresh and dry plant biomass when water and sucrose are supplied in adequate amounts through a fed batch process. NSF technique is recommend when 1) propagating at low plant density which is appropriate for increasing the number of elite plants in vitro, and 2) using high plant density required more nutrients to produce more biomass. However, rhizomes have a different optimal medium than multiplication ratio and fresh biomass production with the incipient nutrients stress of SF necessary to maximize rhizome dry biomass. Optimal concentrations of the mineral nutrients in a media formulation changes with the desired response and the process used.']"
2017-06-28T00:00:00Z,Climatic anomaly affects the immune competence of California sea lions,"['The consequences of having suboptimal immune responses could be devastating to the entire CSL 2014 and 2015 cohorts, particularly if a highly virulent pathogen were to ‘enter’ the population. Even in absence of such a challenge, without proper nutrition, pups are likely to be unable to elicit responses against opportunistic pathogens, and mortality would expectedly be high. We returned to SBA in February 2016 and found that the entire CSL colony was reduced by 77%, relative to the previous year during the same dates (total count: 584 in 2016 vs. 2,555 in 2015). Extremely few live pups were found at the archipelago (343 in 2016 vs. 1,567 in 2015) and most of those that were present were severely emaciated and weak. An unusual high number of carcasses were also recorded. It is too early to understand the impacts that the abnormal oceanographic conditions will have on CSL pups later in their life, but based on life-history theory, their fitness would expectedly be poor. Furthermore, as the high SST conditions encompassed the northeastern Pacific, the entire CSL population could be impacted, as has been reported for other pinnipeds during past El Niño events [10].In conclusion, we have shown that abrupt and unexpected environmental changes can affect key physiological components. The observed effects of the abnormally high SST linked to The Blob and El Niño are unlikely to be limited to the CSL; the entire northeastern Pacific ecosystem could potentially be vulnerable. Under the current climatic scenario, systematic surveys within this region would be invaluable to determine the full scope of effects and assess their wider and long-term consequences.']"
2017-07-17T00:00:00Z,Impact of maternal body mass index and gestational weight gain on neonatal outcomes among healthy Middle-Eastern females,"['The developmental origins of many chronic diseases begin during the embryonic phases due to the interactions between the maternal health status and the genotypic variations, thus the importance of adequate weight of pregnant females to prevent future illnesses of offspring’s. Gaining “too much” or “too little” throughout pregnancy represent another significant danger for both the mother and the baby. In the light of the rising prevalence of overweight and obesity worldwide, it’s not surprising that women of childbearing age are among the first line victims too. Our results revealed significant negative neonatal outcomes when women start their pregnancy with an inadequate BMI; thus, nutritional counseling by health care professionals is crucial to reach an optimal BMI before conception when planning a pregnancy and monitor GWG throughout gestation. Since pregnancy is recognized as an ideal time for education and intervention, pregnant women would be strongly motivated to adopt a healthier lifestyle for the benefit of the fetus.Future researches will aim at evaluating growth velocity and development of newborns that were included in this study, evaluate maternal postpartum weight retention and childhood obesity and at enrolling a larger sample of women from different Lebanese regions in prospective studies in order as well as studying the impact of new variables such as dietary intake and physical activity, in addition to BMI and GWG on maternal and neonatal outcomes. Collaborations should be planned on national level and with neighboring countries to monitor these aspects related to feto-maternal health, to improve the health outcomes of future generations.']"

The overall food web response to guanotrophication was a long-lasting erosion of the benthic pathway in favour of the planktonic one, especially when guano input was higher. Primary consumers, mostly generalist deposit feeders, showed consistent trophic switches as an adaptation to the differing availability, and presumably nutritional quality, of organic matter sources. Secondary consumers had a more omnivorous feeding regime and triggered the coupling of planktonic and benthic pathways in the subsidized pond. Community-trophic niche width varied according to guanotrophication seasonality: it narrowed and widened when guanotrophication increased and decreased respectively. In contrast, the similarity of food chain length among all ponds may be due to the opposite effect of disturbance due to intense guanotrophication and increased primary productivity, rather than to homogeneity in the ecosystem processes among ponds.To conclude, assessment of food web structure and metrics revealed different ecosystem processes and dynamics between ponds, as an effect of the differing ornithogenic subsidies. In particular, seasonal variability in the isotopic metrics was associated with changes in guanotrophication, indicating a detrimental condition when the trophic effects of guano input intensify.Lastly, the study of a food web influenced by continuous seabird nutrient subsidies contributes to a better understanding of the potential role of seabirds in aquatic ecosystems, an issue which has until now been overlooked.']"
2016-03-01T00:00:00Z,Content and Composition of Branched-Chain Fatty Acids in Bovine Milk Are Affected by Lactation Stage and Breed of Dairy Cow,"['U.S. American nutrition guidelines state that most dairy product choices should be fat-free or reduced-fat, based on the potentially detrimental health effects of SFA [64]. Nonetheless, there is no conclusive evidence that whole milk consumption is harmful to human health [7]. The reduced intake of milk fat in response to these guidelines may result in consumers lacking in various bioactive FA provided by whole-fat dairy products. The profile and content of bioactive FA in milk varies with stage of lactation and breed. A serving of whole milk from HO cows has a higher content of RA, anteiso-15:0, iso-17:0, and n-3 FA (at 5 DIM) than milk from JE cows. Overall, milk from cows at 5 DIM had a higher content of n-3 FA, VA, CLA, iso-17:0, and 17:0. This research suggests that HO cows have a more desirable FA profile from a human health standpoint on a per serving basis, although the numeric difference in total bioactive FA (n-3, VA, CLA, and OBCFA) is modest (281 vs. 253 mg per serving for HO and JE cows, respectively). Regardless of breed, stage of lactation was the predominant factor affecting bioactive FA, with milk from cows at 5 DIM containing a higher amount of bioactive FA than cows at 275 DIM on a per serving basis (340 vs. 240 and 253 mg/serving for 5, 185, and 275 DIM, respectively). Additional research is needed to elucidate the mechanism of the shifts in the milk OBCFA to in order to develop dairy products with an enhanced profile.']"
2016-01-25T00:00:00Z,Analysis on Soil Seed Bank Diversity Characteristics and Its Relation with Soil Physical and Chemical Properties after Substrate Addition,"['The mixed substrates showed a greater advantage for SSBs than single substrates, both in improving the number of species、density and diversity indexes. For improving the three indexes, the mixed substrate composed of rice husk carbon and vermiculite with the volume ratio 1:1 was the best when mixed again with surface soil at the ratio of 30%. The mixed substrate of turfy soil and perlite could effectively enhance the soil moisture content, while the mixed substrate of rice husk carbon and vermiculite could improve the nutritive element content of soil. Plants also reflected obvious regularities of distribution on soil factor gradients. Three obvious cluster groups were presented, of which the first cluster was distributed at the places with a relatively higher content of AK and AP; the second cluster was distributed at the places with relatively higher soil moisture content; and the third cluster of plants didn’t have any obvious relationship with soil physical and chemical properties. Through CCA ordination analysis, AK and AP were considered the most important soil factors. By linear multivariate regression analysis, the correlation coefficients between the AK, AP and the growth height and density were relatively high and significant. The linear regression equation was also significant with P< 0.05, and the equations were: growth height = 142.728 − 1.514TC + 30.218AP − 5.083TN + 10.839AK + 1.234mc; density = 68.216 − 4.609TC + 9.566AP − 35.492TN + 19.779AK − 1.591mc.']"
2018-02-14T00:00:00Z,Mapping human vulnerability to climate change in the Brazilian Amazon: The construction of a municipal vulnerability index,"['The results presented here are a pioneering attempt to evaluate the social-environmental and health vulnerability of the population of the state of Amazonas to the impacts of climate change. The major contributions of this study are the development of a set of indicators adapted to the reality of Brazil and the mapping of the vulnerabilities of the municipalities of the state of Amazonas using a climatic perspective. The results have shown that a first step towards making the population of Amazonas better prepared to cope with climate impacts would be the improvement of their life and health conditions, as poverty was one of the factors that most influenced the current vulnerability of the municipalities.Another important step towards improving adaptive capacity is to invest in the infrastructure of municipalities, such as health care networks and disaster preparedness, since drought and flood events for the Amazon region may become more frequent and intense. Although this does not represent a greater risk of death to the local population, which is already adapted in many ways, a greater severity of climate events implies a threat to food and the nutritional security of the region. The dependency of the smallholder on the river flood regime, which determines not only the appropriate time for farming and the viable crops, but also the flow of goods between the small cities and Manaus, is evidence of how harmful a change in rainfall and hydrological patterns of the Amazon Basin could be.The methodology applied was developed to be simple and easy to implement so that it could be appropriated by decision-makers at municipal and state levels. The methodology allowed the interpretation of vulnerability in a synthetic manner and the targeting of resources and actions according to regional peculiarities. In the future, this method is likely to be applied to other Amazonian states of Brazil that share the same socio-spatial characteristics as the municipalities of the state of Amazonas.']"
2016-10-21T00:00:00Z,"Diversity in Secondary Metabolites Including Mycotoxins from Strains of Aspergillus Section Nigri Isolated from Raw Cashew Nuts from Benin, West Africa","['The diversity in secondary metabolites including mycotoxins from isolates of Aspergillus section Nigri, analysed using UHPLC-QTOF-MS, revealed several metabolites produced by 7 different species that contaminated cashew nuts samples from Benin. In pure cultures on a laboratory medium, ochratoxin A and fumonisins, the 2 main toxic compounds from black Aspergilli, were produced by strains of 2 predominant species in A. section Nigri, namely A. niger / A. welwitchiae and A. carbonarius, although A. carbonarius is unable to produce fumonisins. Ochratoxins and fumonisins were produced by a relatively little proportion of the isolates of A. niger and A. carbonarius, but it is well know that species of A. section Nigri are the most isolated on cashew kernels, given a substantial number of species that may produce mycotoxins in cashew nuts. Even though the presence of fungi has not always meant the presence of mycotoxins, the production of ochratoxin A and fumonisins by isolates on A. section Nigri on cashew nuts could constitute an additional and hidden problem in term of mycotoxins content, and can negatively affect cashew nut safety and the nutritional quality of the nuts.There are no regulations on ochratoxin A and fumonisins for raw and processed cashew nuts like those of EU and WHO on aflatoxins. Nevertheless, these findings suggest more investigations in order to detect the presence and the levels of ochratoxin A and fumonisins and to evaluate their exact contribution to the total level of mycotoxins in cashew kernels. But immediate actions should emphasize on the prevention by strengthening post-harvest practices that can lower fungal contamination along the cashew nut value chain, mainly during nut storage, where high contamination of species belonging to black Aspergilli are noticed.']"
2013-08-12T00:00:00Z,Application of Artificial Neural Networks to Investigate One-Carbon Metabolism in Alzheimer’s Disease and Healthy Matched Individuals,"['The present study represents the first attempt to use ANNs the understand folate metabolism in AD and healthy matched control subjects, and reveals the importance to evaluate this pathway as a whole rather than to take into consideration its components one at once. Among 30 initial variables of the pathway, 16 of them seem to contain significant information to discriminate between AD and control subjects in our cohort, and the semantic connectivity map here generated reveals both already known and novel connections among variables and disease risk (Figure 3). Of particular interest are variables, such as TYMS and DNMT3B genotypes, that albeit not previously detected in genetic association studies might play a significant contribution when considering the complexity of interactions with other variables of this pathway. Though we achieved good results using ANNs for our small dataset, results are not necessarily generalizable to other populations but need to be validated independently in future studies. Differences might arise from a population to another one, due to different dietary habits or to a different distribution of the studied polymorphisms and other geographic factors. However, our system is able to understand the connections among studied variables and those of relevance in a particular dataset. The addiction of other variables, such as brain volume, DNA methylation content, DNA damage, and so on, coupled with the possibility to graphically visualize the strengths of connections among all the studied variables, could be a helpful and timely tool to unravel the link between folate metabolism and AD, particularly in a period when nutritional supplementation has been often suggested as a preventative strategy to delay epigenetic modifications linked to the onset of age-related disease such as AD [69].']"
2014-12-30T00:00:00Z,Genome-Wide Identification and Comprehensive Analyses of the Kinomes in Four Pathogenic Microsporidia Species,"['Microsporidian kinomes consist of the AGC, CAMK, CMGC, CK1, STE, Other, and Atypical groups, but lack RGC, TK and TKL groups. Their ePKs catalytic domains, critical amino acid residues and motifs are relatively conserved. Some kinases involved in nutrition and energy signaling, and stress responses, were lost. But genes related to cell cycle, development and growth were well conserved.Our results revealed the following novel findings: 1), the N. ceranae kinome (27 ePKs and 4 aPKs) except E. cuniculi, is the smallest eukaryotic kinome characterized to date; 2), microsporidian kinome size reduction is in good agreement with proteome compaction, albeit with increased kinome densities accompanying proteome reduction; 3), microsporidia share 35 subfamilies with the fly and human kinomes, 33 with the worm, and 25 with the yeast. Nearly three-quarters of the kinase subfamilies from a common ancestor were lost in the microsporidia including some critical kinases in metabolism, apoptosis, cellular proliferation, differentiation, mitotic progression, cytokinesis and morphogenesis process; 4), the coevolution of microsporidia and their hosts is not reflected in protein kinases. In both the mammal- and insect-pathogenic microsporidia, no remarkable differences were observed in kinase family distribution, domain architecture, key amino acid residues, gene gain and loss, or selective pressure.In conclusion, our results further enriched and updated the microsporidian protein kinase database, provide some valuable information for future functional investigations of protein kinase gene family for drugs identify candidates to control pathogenic diseases.']"
2015-06-02T00:00:00Z,Direct Effects of Microalgae and Protists on Herring (Clupea harengus) Yolk Sac Larvae,"['The role of microplankton organisms have largely been overlooked in studies examining early feeding in marine fish larvae (the ‘protozooplankton-ichthyoplankton link’, [46,47]) despite laboratory studies demonstrating that larvae pursue, attack and consume microplankton [48–50], and field studies reporting that protists can form a large portion of the gut contents of marine fish larvae [49,51]. In this study, the duration of the ‘window of opportunity’ for first-feeding was ~3-fold greater in herring larvae reared in the presence compared to the absence of phytoplankton and an heterotrophic protist. When naïve larvae were exposed to copepod nauplii, larvae reared with algae and protists attacked prey more frequently than those reared in only seawater. The presence of microalgae and dinoflagellates did not change the trajectory of growth or life span but the precocious feeding may have important implications when larger micro- and meso-zooplankton are available. Precocious feeding is likely important to growth and survival of marine fish larvae and there are potential nutritional benefits/decrements for larvae foraging on larger prey (copepods) which have consumed different types of algae and protists. Therefore, we recommend that future studies examining the role of algae and protists on yolk sac larvae include additional treatments with larger prey (copepods) and that measurements be extended into the exogenous feeding period. Furthermore, to adequately assess match-mismatch dynamics of larvae in the field, measurements of microalgae and protists should be integrated within routine monitoring programs as well as both indirect markers such as stable isotopes [51] and direct markers such as proteomics or genetic analyses of gut contents [52].']"
2018-11-27T00:00:00Z,A metabolome-wide characterization of the diabetic phenotype in ZDF rats and its reversal by pioglitazone,"['In summary, an in-depth analysis of metabolic changes associated with genetic, nutritional and pharmacological perturbations in the female ZDF rat was conducted using mass spectrometry. All perturbations induced pronounced shifts in metabolism that were consistent with the phenotype observed by established clinical biomarkers and an in vivo imaging analysis. The diabetic state in obese rats was associated with hyperglycemia and decreased amino acids levels, reflecting stimulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis, dyslipidemia and elevated β-oxidation. As mass spectrometry achieves a resolution to single components rather than capturing whole classes, subtle differences in metabolite profiles, e.g. between short chain, long chain and polyunsaturated fatty acids, or between amino acid subclasses could be detected. Most of the biochemical signatures of diabetes were reversed by pioglitazone, underlining the broad impact of PPARγ activation that is overall beneficial for metabolic parameters. With 420 biochemicals in serum, 443 in liver and 603 in intestine, the study represents the most detailed metabolomic investigation of the ZDF rat model and of TZD effects reported so far. It deepens the understanding of the ZDF rat model and provides an extensive dataset that can serve to pinpoint similarities and differences on the metabolite level between the ZDF rat and humans with diabetes. Overall, the metabolite alterations in major biochemical pathways further validate the ZDF rat as a suitable preclinical model of diabetes in humans. For an enhanced understanding of the observed change patterns, a system-oriented view, built by linking metabolite levels with the transcriptional regulation of their biosynthesis and catabolism might be a fruitful extension for future studies.']"
2013-04-12T00:00:00Z,Dietary Iron Concentration May Influence Aging Process by Altering Oxidative Stress in Tissues of Adult Rats,"['Despite the molecular mechanisms for the regulation of iron absorption, the chronic consumption of a diet with high iron content by adult rats resulted in the accumulation of iron in the liver, spleen and gut, increased oxidative stress in the majority of studied tissues and reduced the activity of some antioxidant enzymes. Although the restriction of dietary iron only reduced iron levels in skeletal muscle, with the exception of spleen and muscle, it protected the other studied tissues against oxidative damage to lipids and proteins and resulted in increased activity of GPx in spleen. However, dietary restriction of iron also caused higher weight loss, increased oxidative stress in muscle and spleen and resulted in high activity of Nox in liver of adult rats. The results of this study indicated that iron supplementation may accelerate aging processes by increasing tissues oxidative damages, while iron restriction may retard. However, iron restriction may also impair other physiological processes that are not associated with aging. Considering the limitations of the animal model used in this study, the treatment of elderly patients with iron chelators could reduce oxidative stress in some tissues but could also lead to cell dysfunction due to the depletion of bioavailable iron. On the other hand, the iron fortification of several foods, which occurs in various countries, may increase oxidative stress and, consequently, compromise both the quality and the life expectancy meanly of elderly populations. In conclusion, adult organism may be more vulnerable to changes in the concentrations of dietary iron than young, because they lose their capacity to control the iron absorption by the modulation of hepcidin levels.']"
2016-07-28T00:00:00Z,Phylogenomics and Divergence Dating of Fungus-Farming Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) of the Genera Sericomyrmex and Apterostigma,"['Results from our phylogenetic and dating analyses suggest that the genus Sericomyrmex has undergone a very recent, rapid diversification, reflected by short branch lengths and recent divergence dates. Most surprisingly, the overall genetic similarity between the three Sericomyrmex morphospecies is unexpectedly high. It is our hope that these results will inspire further investigation into the genetic mechanisms underlying rapid radiation with little genetic change in Sericomyrmex. In addition to this phenomenon and its implications for speciation, recent research on social parasites and agro-predators makes this genus an exciting model system for studying behavioral ecology, coevolution, and chemical ecology [62–64]. The transcriptomes sequenced in this study could provide the foundation for future research in gene discovery, phylogenomics, population genomics, and conservation genetic studies [65,66]. In our analyses of gene families (arginine metabolic pathway, Cytochrome P450, hexamerins, RYamide, desaturase, and chitinase) we failed to find two arginine anabolic enzymes in the paleoattine ant A. megacephala, suggesting that the loss of these enzymes, confirmed previously only in the clade Neoattini, was likely lost at the origin of the fungus-farming ants. We recovered a surprisingly small number of CytP450 genes, which are associated with detoxification and unspecialized diets. Additional research is required to confirm these gene losses, since our data do not include larval transcripts, and therefore cannot be interpreted as conclusive. Finally, we hope the transcriptome of A. megacephala will prove a useful tool for future research on the underlying genetics that makes this species the only lower attine ant known to cultivate a higher attine fungus [9].']"
2018-03-26T00:00:00Z,Simulated tri-trophic networks reveal complex relationships between species diversity and interaction diversity,"['While this model will be useful for developing basic hypotheses concerning the drivers of trophic interaction diversity, there are details in our model that merit further work. We utilized this simulation to test hypotheses about accumulation patterns of species and interactions, but this modeling approach is also appropriate for investigating spatial scaling of interactions and species. A great deal of progress has been made towards understanding species diversity, but we lack even a rudimentary understanding of the determinants and spatial or temporal dynamics of interaction diversity. Food web simulations may be particularly useful to investigate more about the relationships between local and regional interaction diversity [60,61], which will provide insight into the utility of the preponderance of large regional networks that are used to address big issues in ecology and conservation.In conclusion, we demonstrated that in highly specialized communities, trophic interactions accumulate more quickly than species. We showed that diet breadth and taxonomic richness both interact to influence relationships between species and interaction diversity. Importantly, this model demonstrated that the position and number of trophic levels being investigated strongly impacted correlations among species and interaction diversity, which is critical for biodiversity research and conservation efforts. Interaction and species diversity are most divergent when incorporating more than two trophic levels, so utilizing interaction diversity as a metric of biodiversity will be useful for multi-trophic investigations for both applied and basic research questions such as spatiotemporal dynamics, a biogeographical theory of species interactions [8], and the effects of climate change on biological networks.']"
2018-05-10T00:00:00Z,5000 years of dietary variations of prehistoric farmers in the Great Hungarian Plain,"['In summary, the results of the isotopic data analysed here suggest changes in dietary patterns from Early Neolithic to Early Iron Age that are not in all cases associated with cultural and genetic shifts. The dietary practices of the individuals from the Early Neolithic Körös site of Tiszaszőlős-Domaháza is in accord with the genetic data. Their dietary isotopic profiles resemble the continuity of a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer pattern with an important reliance on freshwater resources consumption. The Mesolithic genomic signature of one of the individuals, together with similar dietary patterns, might indicate some evidence of contact between Early Neolithic communities and indigenous hunter-gatherers, as previously suggested [13]. A diet based on terrestrial C3 plant resources seems to be common from Early Neolithic to Copper Age periods, in accordance with the genomic stasis [13]. Although a genomic shift was shown with the advent of Bronze Age technology, isotopic results from Early Bronze Age individuals suggest that they were not accompanied by important changes in dietary pattern and that they continued with the same subsistence practices as in previous Neolithic and Copper Age times. However, the Late Bronze Age, together with Early Iron Age individuals, have significantly higher δ13C ratios than previous times suggesting a dietary change with a higher consumption of millet, which is in accordance with its wide cultivation in Europe from the second millennium BC. Nitrogen isotopic ratios from both domesticated fauna and humans are suggestive of consumption of fertilised crops from Middle Neolithic, which may be probable due to the use of secondary agricultural products (manure) [29].']"
2014-07-16T00:00:00Z,Balancing Energy Budget in a Central-Place Forager: Which Habitat to Select in a Heterogeneous Environment?,"['Combining RSF to survey data, diet characterization, and calorimetric analyses allowed us to characterize habitat selection processes of a central-place forager from an energy trade-off perspective. It also shows that other factors such as predation risk associated to deterrence programs at landfills can also play a role in the process of habitat selection at large spatial scales as suggested through the concept of landscape of fear [53]. This approach was applied to a species that had to move over a large area to find food in a heterogeneous environment where habitat profitability also varied in time. Despite the complexity brought up by travel costs and habitat sampling issues, we were able to show that classical optimal foraging theory can make qualitative predictions applicable at the landscape level. This adds to the few evidences that optimal foraging theory has the potential to be scaled-up to the landscape level as predicted by Lima and Zollner [6]. Moreover, once classical models will have been modified such that their constraints are adapted to large spatio-temporal scales (e.g., [11], [54], [55]), GPS data loggers will allow us to test these models by linking the foraging behaviour of individuals to their breeding performance [14]. Such progress would make significant strides toward understanding the links between movement behaviour, habitat selection, fitness, and population dynamics within heterogeneous landscapes. For instance, this approach could be applied to many gull populations around the world to link their dynamics to food availability through landfill, agriculture, and fishery management.']"
2019-09-25T00:00:00Z,Antioxidant properties of potato tubers (Solanum tuberosum L.) as a consequence of genetic potential and growing conditions,"['The conducted research on the influence of the production system, locality and potato cultivars on the content of particular antioxidant compounds revealed that potatoes can contribute to a higher intake of antioxidants in the human diet due to the quantity and regularity of potato consumption [14, 42]. Especially organic farming caused a significant increase of the antioxidants pool and antioxidative activity of potato tubers at least in the case of the investigated varieties. However, an up to 50% lower yield should be taken into account. The results confirmed a main influence of the production system, the locality, and the year of experiment, the latter reflecting an impact of the weather conditions. The choice of the potato variety played a secondary role. However, the well-established cvs Satina and Jelly produced higher concentrations of the desired health promoting compounds and can be recommended for both integrated and organic production. In conclusion, this study is a relevant contribution to the breeding programs with the target of enhancing the antioxidant properties of potato tubers and implicate the use of new and improved clones such as 13-VIII-49, 13-VIII-50 and 13-VIII-60 for further work, especially for organic farming. The application of a multidimensional comparative analysis (MCA) allowed an effective evaluation of the influence of chosen factors on many antioxidant properties in a more sophisticated way by building a synthetic value that enables a comparison in order to draw a general conclusion. Future studies shall continue to validate the chosen, promising clones for their sensory properties and tolerance to diseases such as late blight. Finally, the effect of other factors, such as storage and processing ability should be considered.']"
2017-07-19T00:00:00Z,Does culture create craving? Evidence from the case of menstrual chocolate craving,"['In sum, we present evidence for a role of acculturation in the experience of menstrual chocolate craving. In the absence of significant between-group differences in overall chocolate and other food craving prevalence, these results suggest that exposure to U.S. culture increases the likelihood that menstruation is identified as a perceived trigger or cause of chocolate cravings, perhaps in an effort to justify consumption of an otherwise “forbidden” food. Findings have several important implications. They inform our understanding of diet-related health in immigrants to the U.S., who are initially at relatively lower risk of overweight (the “healthy migrant effect”) [35], an advantage that dissipates as a function of decreased consumption of ethnic foods [36]. Menstrual craving has been linked to higher body mass and elevated eating disorder symptomology [37], suggesting that it may be another potentially preventable negative consequence of dietary acculturation specifically in women.Importantly, our findings also add to growing evidence suggesting that the craving construct, or at least certain elements of the craving experience, may be uniquely meaningful in North America. For example, most languages outside of English lack a fully equivalent translation of the term “craving” [38]. It is increasingly recognized that sociocultural factors can dramatically alter the course and outcomes of disorders traditionally attributed solely to biological abnormalities (e.g., schizophrenia) [39]. Future research should examine the impact of acculturation on the experience and manifestation of conditions characterized by recurrent cravings, including addictions, eating and weight disorders, paraphilias, and impulse control and obsessive-compulsive disorders.']"
2016-04-20T00:00:00Z,Oxidative Stress and Metabolic Perturbations in Wooden Breast Disorder in Chickens,"['The findings in this study suggest that Wooden Breast disease in commercial chickens is accompanied by a unique biochemical signature that may have diagnostic potential. Future studies that examine the plasma or serum from affected and unaffected animals may confirm the utility of these metabolites as non-invasive biomarkers. A predictive accuracy of 100% by random forest analysis (RFA) for detecting affected cases is remarkable considering that the chickens used in this study were sampled from two genetically distinct purebred lines and one commercial broiler population (more information about genetic diversity in these populations can be found in Fu et al., 2015 [53]).Although the exact etiology of this novel muscle disease is currently unknown, our study provides important information regarding metabolic pathways and biochemicals involved in the pathogenesis of Wooden Breast disease. The presence of oxidative stress in affected muscle, which has been previously hypothesized through gene expression [6] and microscopic analyses [1], is well supported by our metabolomics findings. In addition, our findings provide mechanistic insights into metabolic pathways potentially contributing to oxidative stress in affected muscle. The results confirm altered glucose metabolism in affected chickens, which has been previously postulated based on findings from a RNA-sequencing experiment [6]. Finally, our results suggest that vitamin C supplementation may help lower the incidence of the Wooden Breast myopathy in modern broiler chickens. Future research using different levels of vitamin C in the broilers’ diet may help elucidate the usefulness of vitamin C supplementation.']"
2017-08-14T00:00:00Z,Microbiota of little penguins and short-tailed shearwaters during development,"['The results from this study identified that the development of the seabird microbiota differs greatly between LP and STS. In the little penguin, there were significant differences in changes throughout development, with a significant upward trend in the abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Whereas, in the short-tailed shearwater there were no significant differences throughout development with a high level of similarity between each age class. However, there is low similarity in the microbial composition between adults and chicks for both the STS and LP, indicating that the adult’s microbiota may have a negligible influence over the chick’s microbiota. The differences between little penguins and short-tailed shearwaters could be in part due to differences in diet composition, digestive physiology, nesting environment, host phylogeny and reproductive strategy, all of which have been previously shown to strongly influence the microbial composition of vertebrates [7, 72–74].In seabirds, fledging body mass is associated with juvenile survival [75–78] and therefore, the accumulation of fat reserves is important for post fledging survival. In little penguin chicks the relatively high abundance of butyrate-producing microbes could influence body mass, as previously observed in poultry [62]. Although the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes in short-tailed shearwaters strongly resembles that of obese humans, mice and Australian Sea Lions (Neophoca cinerea), the microbes within the phylum Firmicutes (Lysinibacillus, Leuconostoc and Lactococcus) have not previously been associated with energy extraction, lipid accumulation or obesity. Due to the absence of information on the functional role of the dominant microbiota, we are unable to elucidate the role of the GI microbiota in fledging survival of little penguins and short-tailed shearwaters.']"

The underlying mode of action apparently includes anti-inflammatory effects, in particular inhibition of IL1B production and protection of intestinal integrity unrelated to alterations in gut microbial ecology (Fig 7). Taken together, supplementing the diet of pigs with OBE might represent a promising strategy to counteract SCI-related disorders in commercial settings of pig production.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0174239.g007\nFig 7\n\nSupposed metabolic targets involved in OBE mediated effects.\nRepeated LPS injection stimulates the systemic secretion of pro-inflammatory IL1B and simultaneously suppresses feed intake and growth in challenged animals. OBE is capable of counteracting LPS stimulated IL1B secretion most likely through interaction with NF-κB signal cascade. OBE treatment further increases the concentration of junctional mRNA (OCLN, CDH1, ZO-1) and promotes TJ-functionality as indicated by decreased ion flux (TEER) and improved cobalt to mannitol ratio. Increased gene expression of junctional proteins as well as an improved TJ-functionality can be linked to enhanced gut integrity, further supporting animal growth and performance. Particular importance is devoted to the finding that the growth promoting effect of OBE is mediated independent of changes in gut microbial composition and diversity. Plain connections represent observed (solid) and supposed (interrupted) metabolic effects of chronic LPS challenge. Colour-filled arrows indicate effects of OBE treatment.\n\n\n']"
2017-05-17T00:00:00Z,Effect of dietary restriction and subsequent re-alimentation on the transcriptional profile of bovine ruminal epithelium,"['Following a period of dietary restriction, we described evidence for reduced gene expression and cellular interactions in rumen papillae tissue of Holstein Friesian bulls. This was in conjunction with an apparent enhanced immune response potential. During subsequent re-alimentation induced CG, our data suggest that greater nutrient intake is consistent with an up-regulation in transcriptional activity of ruminal epithelial tissue, which may in turn lead to greater nutrient uptake through an increase in papillae surface area and ultimately contribute to increased feed efficiency typical of CG, thus supporting the accelerated growth phenomenon of both the rumen as well as the animal. In contrast to that observed for diet restricted cattle a period of improved feed efficiency was consistent with a reduction in the abundance of transcripts for genes involved in immune response, potentially allowing more energy to be channelled towards growth within the rumen papillae. Our results also suggest that the structural state of the gastrointestinal tract may play an important role in governing feed efficiency, with an increase in rumen papillae surface area during re-alimentation potentially contributing to improvements in nutrient absorption during periods of accelerated growth. The new knowledge generated in this study offers further insights into some of the many molecular processes underlying nutrient restricted and CG states in cattle. However functional studies are now warranted to validate the hypotheses put forward in the current study. Furthermore, our DEG patterns provide baseline data which may be further interrogated and used to identify animals with superior genetic potential for CG and associated feed efficiency.']"

Coupling metataxonomics with metagenome prediction gives insights into the genes and metabolic pathways associated with a microbiome, and is a very powerful technique for the functional profiling of microbial communities. Here, it was applied to the profiling of the rumen microbiome in dairy calves fed differentially supplemented diets. Copper and grape-pomace feed supplementations appeared to alter the rumen microbiome, both in terms of species diversity and gene functions. Results were in line with previous findings in both ruminal, human and murine microbiota. The addition of grape-pomace, in particular, seemed to modify the rumen microbial population, with an apparent effect also on methanogenic bacteria and methane metabolism in the rumen. It needs be emphasized though, that Archaea and methanogenic taxa were not specifically targeted by the sequencing approach employed in this study, and results should therefore be considered as indicative.Overall, although from a small-scale experiment, the results presented here offer an interesting characterization of the rumen microbiota in dairy calves and the effects that copper and grape-pomace feed supplementation may exert. Grape-pomace, in particular, is a common byproduct from wine processing, and knowledge of its effects on the rumen microbiome will be helpful in assessing its potential as feedstuff for livestock. Using local industrial byproducts as animal feed constitutes a nice example of circular economy applied to the agri-food industry. Further experiments are however needed to confirm the neutral-to-positive effects of grape-pomace on the bovine rumen microbiome.']"
2018-11-07T00:00:00Z,"Tooth development, histology, and enamel microstructure in Changchunsaurus parvus: Implications for dental evolution in ornithopod dinosaurs","['Given the previous focus on dental histology in derived, Late Cretaceous carnivores and herbivores in the literature [5], the present histological analysis of the teeth and jaws of Changchunsaurus parvus from the Cretaceous Quantou formation in Jilin Province, China, provides the first in-depth look at tooth histology and development in a dinosaur that may lie close to the base of the ornithopod radiation [40]. This has important bearing on our understanding of the evolution of the more complex dental batteries seen in hadrosaurids from the more modest, single-rowed dentitions of most herbivorous dinosaurs. These histological sections have revealed several surprising features that may have evolved in association with herbivory in this early ornithischian, including the presence of wavy enamel and an unusual tooth replacement mode. In contrast, the presence of root cementum and a periodontal ligament connection of the tooth to the alveolus are probably symplesiomorphic features in ornithischians and in dinosaurs more generally. The presence of replacement foramina close to the apex of the jaw and a short contribution of interdental bone contrasts strongly with the condition in hadrosaurids. We use this comparison to hypothesize that hadrosaurids have evolved a reduced lingual wall of the jaws and, correspondingly, greater contributions of interdental bone via a shift in the position of the dental lamina towards the base of the jaws. Using these data as an example, we advocate that similar studies of early members of major dinosaurian clades are needed in order to incorporate histological characters into phylogenetic analyses and to understand how dinosaur dentitions have evolved over millions of years to cope with their diverse diets.']"
2018-12-19T00:00:00Z,How much for a broken heart? Costs of cardiovascular disease in Colombia using a person-based approach,"['CVD significantly increases the average cost of a patient. The paper presented point estimates of such costs using a person-based approach, which is a more accurate cost estimation in social health insurance schemes where the core of the risk is the individual rather than healthcare services. Relative estimates showed that CVD patients cost around 10 times more than non-CVD patients. The main policy implication of these findings is that prevention of new CVD cases is a crucial strategy for financial sustainability of the health system. Reduction of the financial burden of healthcare for CVD patients must be achieved through higher savings from avoided cases rather than savings from strategies to reduce the cost of CVD-related healthcare services, such as efficiency gains or reduction of input prices.Cost estimates obtained here can be extrapolated to countries with similar conditions in the process of performing cost assessment of their own health insurance benefits. Cost estimates by age and gender presented in this paper allow those countries to calculate their own average cost by combining these estimates with their own demographic structure.For future research, the methodology can be extended to other morbidities such as cancer and COPD. Such results can be used in NCD policy simulation analysis, providing a more realistic approach to avoided costs from population interventions on NCD risk factors such as smoking, unhealthy diets and lack of physical activity. Those estimates are useful for policymakers, in particular, for MoH and Ministries of Finance when discussing budgeting of the health system or the allocation of additional resources for prevention of NCDs.']"
2004-05-11T00:00:00Z,The Human Sense of Smell: Are We Better Than We Think?,"['Much about the sense of smell seems enigmatic and conflicting. This is partly because of the inherent difficulties in presenting smell stimuli, and partly because there is not yet a recognition of all the relevant mechanisms that are involved.It may be hoped that the hypotheses and mechanisms discussed here can help to address and resolve the mystery of the apparent noncorrelation of olfactory receptor gene numbers with smell acuity, and in doing so stimulate a major reassessment of human smell perception. Such an effort cuts across many academic disciplines. Molecular biologists need to continue their efforts to characterize the olfactory genomes of humans and nonhuman mammals more closely, to compare how different organisms sample odor space. Physiologists need to devise high-throughput systems to test these odor spaces. Behavioral neuroscientists need to develop increasingly accurate tests of olfactory function that enable comparisons across different species. Psychologists need to explore even more vigorously the subtle ways that smells can influence human behavior. Anthropologists and paleontologists need to study the olfactory parts of the cranium and face from this new perspective, to reassess the role that both orthonasal and retronasal smell may have played in primate and human evolution.The factors reviewed here suggest that the sense of smell is more important in humans than is generally realized, which in turn suggests that it may have played a bigger role in the evolution of human diet, habitat, and social behavior than has been appreciated. All of these considerations should stimulate a greater interest in this neglected sense.']"

For the first time, we report that ANC in purple corn increase insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells in vitro potentially through activation of FFAR1. A summary of the effects of the ANC from purple corn in pancreatic β-cells and hepatocytes is shown in Fig 10. The implications of this discovery provide basic understanding to propose future studies, such as in vivo research to confirm this bioactivity, and validation of possible allosteric cooperation in the activation of FFAR1 between ANC and drugs. In addition, the ANC from purple corn enhanced in vitro hepatic glucose uptake, which can contribute to maintaining glucose homeostasis. In general, the anthocyanin-rich extracts were more effective than pure ANC.

2018-07-12T00:00:00Z,Supplementation stocking of Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in small boreal lakes: Ecotypes influence on growth and condition,"['Supplementation stocking is rarely without impacts [6, 13, 27], and predicting the outcomes of supplementation remains a great challenge for management and conservation biology [92–94]. Our study showed that direct and indirect impacts varied depending on the similarity between the source and recipient stocks. Impacts of supplementation were generally small; however, the Lake Trout supplementation strategy in Quebec already incorporates multiple measures to minimize negative impacts (e.g., supplementation with F1 from a wild broodstock and supplementation at the fingerling or yearling stages). Nonetheless, we observed that supplementation stocking modified population growth and condition. We also noted detrimental effects associated with hybridization. Therefore, the similarities between source and supplemented populations must be considered within the decision framework of supplementation management. This can be assessed through simple metrics such as the population’s growth rate, maturation time or diet.In the case of Lake Trout supplementation, ecotypes of source and recipient populations must be viewed as another risk factor that could lead to deleterious effects such as domestication [10, 11, 24, 29]. Ignoring a population’s genetic history and local adaptations can lead to a lower than expected return on investment by increasing cannibalism of juvenile Lake Trout and weakening the body condition of hybrid fish. On the other hand, our results show that supplementation stocking using more similar source/recipient population pairs has negligible ecological impacts. Finally, a precautionary approach in supplementation stocking practice should favor, whenever possible, use of local broodstock or at least a source population similar to the population being supplemented.']"
2018-09-12T00:00:00Z,Phenological responses of 215 moth species to interannual climate variation in the Pacific Northwest from 1895 through 2013,"['This study analyzed the phenological responses of moths to interannual temperature variation in the PNW region of the U.S. and adjacent areas in Canada over a period from 1895 through 2013. Using a relatively streamlined analytical approach and drawing from a large database of natural history collection records for 215 moth species, we found that, on average, moths have flown earlier in years with warmer late winter (February) to early spring (April) temperatures. Most of the warmest years for the region have occurred in the last few decades, and the area is predicted to experience even greater warming over the coming decades. Thus, the average phenological advance of 1.9 days/°C seen across the moths in our study suggests that future phenological shifts in the region could be substantial. Our study also documented considerable variation in both the direction and magnitude of phenological shifts exhibited by different moth species, even within functional groups defined by adult seasonality and larval diet breadth. This variation highlights the tremendous challenges we face if we are to predict accurately how ecological interactions involving any given species may be altered under future climate change. Future efforts to better understand the factors underlying the highly variable phenological responses of moth species to temperature variation may benefit by considering different temporal windows of temperature variation, tailored to the seasonality of each species, as well as by considering the effects of interannual variation in precipitation on moth phenology.']"
2019-05-03T00:00:00Z,Temporal genomic contrasts reveal rapid evolutionary responses in an alpine mammal during recent climate change,"['Temporal sampling of genomic data has the potential to provide powerful insights into the evolutionary effects of rapid environmental change [18]. Here we built on previous works [1, 9, 33] by generating targeted genome-wide sequence data from 294 chipmunks spanning a century of climate change. By integrating high throughput sequencing, cost and time-effective targeted enrichment technologies, and sophisticated inference methods, we provide powerful comparative insights into demographic and evolutionary responses of two montane species experiencing rapid environmental change. Our genomic time-series approach demonstrates one way that historical archives can be used to study biological responses during recent environmental change [9, 11, 18]. Temporal genomic data can provide a means to understand the current state of populations and their potential evolutionary trajectories, providing powerful tools to inform the conservation of populations experiencing changing environments.The identification of targets of positive selection during the recent upslope range contraction in T. alpinus points to a candidate gene and potential phenotypes associated with physiological stress that warrant further study. We caution that further evidence, such as differences in over-winter survival across genotypes or other functional studies, are necessary to demonstrate a causal relationship between Alox15 and response to climatic-induced stress. Further, our capture experiment only covered a subset of protein coding genes (~50%) and did not include extensive coverage of regulatory regions that may often modulate rapid evolutionary responses [63]. That said, alpine chipmunks also show greater stress response to changes in external conditions [64], a narrower range of activity patterns [31], and more pronounced shifts in diet and functional aspects of cranial morphology when compared to T. speciosus over the past century [27, 30]. Thus, the combination of phenotypic, behavioral, and now genetic evidence points to some component of physiological stress as a key factor in the greater sensitivity of T. alpinus to environmental change.Even in the absence of links to specific phenotypes or fitness, the identification of evolutionary responses at specific genes should help inform future on-ground studies focused on identifying the proximate causes of warming-related population declines across the range of this or other affected species [32]. Indeed, the potential for adaptive evolution to rescue populations in decline has emerged as an important concept in conservation biology [65], with increasing efforts to directly incorporate evolutionary principles into conservation planning [66]. As a cautionary note, our results suggest that putatively adaptive responses in T. alpinus at Alox15 (Fig 4), as well as rapid shifts in functional morphology and diet [27, 30], have nonetheless been insufficient to prevent extensive extirpation of lower elevation populations of this alpine specialist.Comparative analyses of species range shifts over the past century have provided powerful insights into the ecological impacts of and biological responses to rapid environmental changes [1, 19, 21–23]. Here we have begun to extend these ideas to a comparative population genomic framework. Moving forward, we suggest that the true power of analyzing genomes and phenotypes of historical museum archives lies in the potential to extend across species [9, 11]. Though the occurrence of museum records tend to be highly punctuated through space and time for a given species, historic collection efforts, such as those led by Joseph Grinnell and other early naturalists, usually surveyed many co-distributed species. With comparable contemporary sampling efforts, these invaluable archives will enable comparative community level insights into the impacts of and evolutionary responses to rapidly changing environments.']"
2017-02-03T00:00:00Z,Characterisation of zinc delivery from a nipple shield delivery system using a breastfeeding simulation apparatus,"['Delivery of zinc from tablets using the NSDS was shown as feasible using a breastfeeding simulation apparatus. During the simulations, zinc was released into breast milk pumped through the breastfeeding simulation apparatus under physiologically relevant fluid flow conditions. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry was demonstrated as a successful method for detecting the zinc released into the breast milk. This detection technique can be applied to future human nutrition and drug delivery studies.Administration of zinc from each of four rapidly disintegrating zinc tablet types used in the NSDS was tested. Of the tested tablets, the total zinc release of tablets of differing hardness but the same compositions was not significantly different from one another based on unpaired t tests using Welch’s correction. Further, for tablets of differing composition but similar hardness the total zinc release was not significantly different from another by the same test.Future work could include testing the efficacy of zinc delivery over a wider range of potential breastfeeding conditions by modifying the tested milk composition, suction rates, and milk flow rates. Alternative tablet compositions, sizes, hardness, or API dosages could also be tested. Furthermore, other dosage forms could be tested with the NSDS. Other NSDS designs could also be investigated to alter the fluid flow through the device and therefore potentially the release properties of the loaded dosage form.There is a strong need for increased paediatric zinc supplementation and therapeutic availability. If scaled up globally and optimised, the NSDS could potentially be used to administer this nutrient, which could be an influential method of decreasing child mortality, especially due to two of the leading preventable causes of death, pneumonia and diarrheal disease [29].']"
2018-12-27T00:00:00Z,"An alternative to mineral phosphorus fertilizers: The combined effects of Trichoderma harzianum and compost on Zea mays, as revealed by 1H NMR and GC-MS metabolomics","['In this work we evaluated, in a pot soil experiment, the effect of Trichoderma inoculation on the growth and nutrient uptake of Zea mays plants treated either with or without different inorganic and organic P fertilizers. Besides the phenological appraisal of biomass and nutrient content, we investigated the changes caused by the fertilizer treatments on the polar metabolites extracted from maize plants and detected by both GC-MS and 1H NMR techniques.All applied treatments with different P sources were very effective in influencing both the metabolic profiles and the P uptake of treated plants. However, the metabolic responses varied with the type of P fertilizer and whether or not the amendments were conducted in combination with the Trichoderma inoculum.In particular, the combined use of Trichoderma OmG-08 and compost (B2P3 and B2P4), significantly improved the plant P uptake and the abundance of metabolites related to photosynthesis with positive repercussions on the produced shoots dry biomass, as compared to controls (B0P3, B0P4). However, the noted differences in shoot dry weight and P content for B2P3 samples in respect to B2P4 plants, suggest that there was also a different response of maize plants to the type of applied compost due to a varied molecular composition.Conversely when combined with mineral fertilizers, the Trichoderma OmG-08 negatively affect the plants growth. Also the metabolic and the nutritional parameters observed in B2P1 and B2P2 treatments were worse than for B0P1 and B0P2. The B2P0 plants were found to be adversely influenced by the inoculation with Trichoderma, most probably because of the competition for the available rhizosphere nutrients between plants and microorganism.Hence, our results confirm that the combination of Trichoderma OmG-08 with composts fertilizer may provide a valuable alternative to satisfy the plant P demand, thus reducing the use of the scarce and environmentally unsustainable mineral P fertilizers.']"
2019-07-18T00:00:00Z,Identifying performance benchmarks and determinants for reproductive performance and calf survival using a longitudinal field study of cow-calf herds in western Canada,"['For future studies of reproductive performance in client-owned herds, we suggest focussing effort on the accurate collection of pregnancy testing data, stillbirth and calf loss information. Investigators should work with producers to encourage more complete reporting of abortion losses and consistently reporting calf death losses within meaningful categories for age at death rather than just reporting all losses between 24 hours of age and weaning. While the present study was not based on a random sample of all cow-calf producers, the results are most applicable to cow-calf clients of veterinary practices and the data were comparable to previous reports from western Canada. Future studies should also focus on accurate and specific production information for defined periods of risk for calf loss (i.e. within 24 hours of birth, 24 hours to 1 month) as compared to summarizing all losses from birth to weaning. Reporting bias due to sales and purchases of cattle are less likely to be an issue in defined periods during the calving season as compared to later during and after the breeding season.The percentiles reported when summarizing individual production metrics can be used by veterinarians and producers to benchmark herd performance, to set realistic goals for improvement and to define thresholds requiring diagnostic investigation. The finding of greater variation among herds in heifer performance than among cows suggests opportunities for improvement in heifer management. The finding that later breeding and calving herds were more at risk for poor pregnancy percentages provides documentation of a problem suspected by producers and veterinarians and will require further investigation to determine the best way to minimize the nutritional challenges of getting cows pregnant later in the growing season.']"

Our studies did not address the physiological or molecular mechanisms of erythritol toxicity. In some insects, ingested erthritol can inhibit uptake of nutritive sugars through the gut wall [11]. Ingestion of erythritol may alter nutrient and/or water absorption and/or efflux.However, erythritol in tissues is not always toxic to arthropods. For example, some insect species that are seasonally exposed to freezing conditions produce erythritol and other polyhydric alcohols as tissue cryoprotectants [12], [13]. Larvae of one antarctic midge can safely ingest erythritol from food plants and sequester it for adult cryoprotection [14]. Toxic effects of ingested erythritol may be dose-dependent, as our data suggest.Of note, erythritol is not the only sweetener known to be toxic to insects. For example, mannose has been shown to be toxic in honey bees [15], [16]. However, mannose was not toxic to Drosophila melanogaster or to Ceratitis capitata [15]. Further study will be required to determine if erythritol is toxic to other insect species.A large body of literature has shown that erythritol consumption by humans is very well tolerated [5], [17]–[19], and indeed, large amounts of both erythritol and Truvia are being consumed by humans every day throughout the world. Taken together, our data set the stage for investigating this compound as a novel, effective, and human safe approach for insect pest control. We suggest targeted bait presentations to fruit crop and urban insect pests are particularly promising.']"
2015-04-14T00:00:00Z,Comparative Transcriptome Profiling of the Early Infection of Wheat Roots by Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici,"['This study is the first to analyze the transcriptome of Ggt and infected wheat root using Illumina platform. A comparison of Ggt in culture to that in roots showed that there were 3,258 2-fold DEGs, of which twice as many were up-regulated than down-regulated. Some of these DEGs have previously been shown to be closely related to Ggt pathogenicity, but many have not been previously associated with Ggt and are promising candidates for further investigation. To the best our knowledge, this study is the first to use Illumina deep sequencing technology to compare the entire transcriptome of Ggt growing saprophytically in culture to Ggt grwoing parasitically in wheat roots. qRT-PCR of a small number of the DEGs showed that expression can be very specific to certain times during the infection, and some DEGs may play specific roles either early or late in the disease.The use of fungal genomics and transcriptomics has started to make major contributions to identifying genes required for pathogenesis, such as those related to signaling, penetration, fungal nutrition and host colonization [61]. The results of this study has contributed to advancing our knowledge of this pathosystem by revealing that Ggt preferentially expresses a considerable number of genes during parasitic growth in roots to signal changes in its environment as it colonizes the root, to combat host resistance mechanisms related to cell wall appositions and antimicrobial compounds, as well as to degrade the plant cell walls, possibly both for obtaining nutrients and allowing for growth of its hyphae through the root tissues. Ultimately, targeting these candidate virulence genes by further analysis, such as gene disruption, will result in a better understanding of these virulence mechanisms of Ggt, which may lead to improving its control resulting in higher yields of wheat and other crop hosts of Ggt worldwide']"
2015-07-02T00:00:00Z,Spatial Patterns and Temperature Predictions of Tuna Fatty Acids: Tracing Essential Nutrients and Changes in Primary Producers,"['We developed a framework that can quantify and predict the spatial and temporal variability of various fatty acid parameters measured in the tissues of large commercially important marine predators. Using this framework we found that the supply and availability of EFA are likely to be negatively affected by increases in sea surface temperature, particularly in temperate environments. The changes in fatty acid proportions and concentrations reflect shifts in phytoplankton dynamics, including species composition and size structure, and describe mechanisms by which marine energy pathways and ecosystem stability could change. The models presented can be used to infer the fatty acid composition of other generalist marine top predators with similar movement patterns and metabolic parameters. They can also be used to understand potential future impacts driven by natural and anthropogenic climate change. Indicators of climate change are thought to be important in planning adaptation strategies for harvested marine species [72]. Indeed, measuring the fatty acid composition and content of regularly fished resources offers a cost effective approach to understand trophic structure dynamics and their response to change. International efforts are now needed to assess broad, global-scale patterns in marine fatty acids similar to that being undertaken for isotopes [73] and trace elements [74].Assessing and monitoring entire ecosystem dynamics from nutrient inputs to top predators is notoriously difficult, largely because there are very few methods that can detect multi-scale and food web integrated signals [75]. As fatty acids are derived from primary producers and are essential for marine organisms to grow, reproduce and survive, they provide excellent tools to simultaneously examine bottom-up drivers of energy transfer, trophic structure and nutritional condition or health at the organismal and community scales.']"
2017-05-18T00:00:00Z,Human plasma metabolomics in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,"['Our results demonstrate for the first time that plasma NMR metabolomics of patients with AMD detects small changes in the levels of selected amino acids and organic acids, as well as particular lipid moieties and protein levels. The changes observed are not very robust, but appear to be associated with the presence of the disease and its severity, rather than age, based on the identification of the particular age-dependent metabolite sets in each cohort. Other potential confounders (gender, smoking history, BMI, comorbidities) were also found not to affect the proposed AMD signatures significantly. Furthermore, the AMD-specific metabolite variations detected were found to partially differ between the two cohorts (Coimbra, Portugal and Boston, US), thus indicating that nutritional and other lifestyle habits may be determining the metabolic response in AMD in different regions. A particularly important result of this study is that, in each cohort, a subgroup of metabolite changes tended to differentiate the controls from the patients diagnosed with early AMD stage (namely acetate, creatine, dimethyl sulfone, cholesterol, HDL-choline and unsaturated fatty acids for Coimbra subjects, and albumin, histidine, glutamine and also unsaturated fatty acids for Boston subjects). This is an important observation that needs to be further investigated since it may contribute to the future definition of AMD biomarkers.In summary, our results suggest that even though the overall metabolite changes detected in relation to AMD in both cohorts are of low magnitude and weak statistical relevance, they appear to be AMD-specific and should, therefore, be explored further in expanded cohorts and with methodologies targeting the metabolic domains of the specific compounds identified. This work has the potential to offer novel biomarkers for AMD, as well as to improve the current understanding of the pathogenesis of this blinding disease.']"

In this study we propose for the first time a full characterization of the complete casein cluster through the transcripts analysis of the four llama casein genes. The sequence of the correctly assembled transcripts allowed us to establish the exonic structure of each gene.Exons skipping and duplication events were evidenced. We were able to identify two variants A (215 amino acids) and B (207 amino acids) in the αs1-casein gene as result of the alternative out-splicing of the exon 18, which opens the possibility for further genetic studies. No splicing were evidenced in the β- and αs2-casein, although in the latter one extra exon was found through the comparison with the dromedary camel sequence. A cryptic exon of 43 bp was found in the κ-casein. This finding is particularly interesting because it leads to have two possible ATG (Methionine) as translation start codon.The characterization at cDNA level of llama casein is fundamental for the detection of genetic variability, for studies involving the identification of protein variants as well as post translational modifications. In this regard, the differences predicted in the pI might be responsible for different migration patterns for the llama casein fractions in iso-electro-focusing (IEF) experiments. Therefore, the information herein reported might be helpful to establish new IEF standards in llama and useful for the identification of protein variants.This work adds fundamental knowledge on the molecular basis of milk protein genes in llamas and can be useful for the understanding of the evolution of casein genes especially in Camelidae. Future studies will allow to figure out the functional characteristics (nutritional and dietetic) of this milk to better meet the food requirements of rural population, but also for the newborn offspring.']"
2016-05-20T00:00:00Z,"The Lithic Assemblages of Xiaochangliang, Nihewan Basin: Implications for Early Pleistocene Hominin Behaviour in North China","['Here we have provided the most up-to-date study of XCL lithic assemblages, a key Early Pleistocene site in the Nihewan Basin of China. At ca. 1.36 Ma, XCL is among the oldest Early Pleistocene sites in China, slightly younger than other Nihewan sites dated to between ca. 1.7–1.6 Ma [2,11]. The presence of hominins in the Nihewan Basin, at 40°N, has been considered a major biogeographic event and a new evolutionary threshold for hominins, as this is the northernmost location of early humans in Eastern Asia [2, 5], though it has been suggested that hominins were not present in these northern latitudes during cold periods or during sub-freezing seasons of the year [72]. During ameliorated periods, Early Pleistocene hominins presumably expanded and utilized the Basin for diet-related activities, implied by the presence of vertebrate fossils in sites and evidence for use-wear on lithics, indicating the processing of plants and animals [19]. Though hominin visits to the Nihewan Basin may have been short term and infrequent, on account of the northern and highly seasonal position of the region [72], our study indicates that Early Pleistocene hominins demonstrated considerable technological flexibility, utilizing freehand and bipolar techniques in variable frequency, thereby overcoming limits of small clast size and poor quality materials to obtain sharp-edged implements for subsistence activities. More widely, the lithic evidence from the Nihewan Basin supports the notion that versatility in Mode I tool-making and behaviour was critical in allowing expanding (and re-expanding) groups of hominins to cope with, and adapt to, unfamiliar Eurasian landscapes and changing habitats [73, 74].']"
2016-10-13T00:00:00Z,The TreadWheel: A Novel Apparatus to Measure Genetic Variation in Response to Gently Induced Exercise for Drosophila,"['We have presented a novel method to exercise flies called the TreadWheel. Flies are intrinsically motived to move to the top of their enclosures, thus the TreadWheel induces low-impact exercise in adult Drosophila by slowly turning their enclosures. Our studies tested two five-day exercise regimes, one with short exercise bouts separated by short rest periods (Study A) in a cluster once a day and the other with a long continuous bout of moderate exercise once a day (Study B). We found that exercise through the short bout regime decreases body weight, total triglycerides, and glycogen and increases protein content and climbing performance. The short bout exercise regime had significantly varying impacts across genotype and sex for body weight, triglycerides, protein, glycogen, and glucose levels, indicating that studies of exercise effectiveness should consider these factors as well. We also found that the moderate exercise regime had variable effect across genetic lines for glycerol levels and feeding behavior. We suspect that the variation in line effects was in part due to the variation in motivation the distinct genotypes demonstrated. The moderate exercise study also demonstrated that a number of genes involved in mitochondrial and metabolic function change expression in response to exercise, showing that the molecular mechanisms involved in the exercise response in other systems also play a role in flies. Thus, the TreadWheel is a valuable tool for future high-throughput studies on how genotype interacts with exercise and other environmental factors like diet to influence the metabolic health and longevity of organisms. The ability to exercise Drosophila with a low stress regime will also lead to discoveries of which metabolic pathways are modified by exercise in this well characterized model organism.']"
2018-02-23T00:00:00Z,The impact of poverty reduction and development interventions on non-communicable diseases and their behavioural risk factors in low and lower-middle income countries: A systematic review,"['While current research on the duel impact of interventions on development, poverty reduction and NCD prevention is scarce, great potential exists for future programmes. It is essential to note that a key finding of this review is the lack of evidence for development interventions on NCD outcomes, as well as the lack of inclusions of NCDs in interventions outcome measures. A historical dominance of development interventions on addressing undernutrition has meant the measurement tools and study designs continue to focus on measures of undernutrition despite the growing double burden of malnutrition and NCDs. Measurement structures and programme focus on undernutrition do however create great potential. The promotion of healthy diets within development interventions is an important area for future focus.Addressing health and NCDs is essential for interventions to have a sustainable impact on development and achieve the SDG targets. Failure to do so could compound current health problems and hinder development. Setting NCD sensitive objectives and measurements within poverty and development interventions could lead to simple adjustments, with great impact. Results from our review also highlight how NCD risk factors within LLMICS stray from the four commonly targeted behaviour changes. In measuring risk and impact on NCDs within future interventions, it is recommended to tailor programmes to country-specific risk factors. Improved measurement tools and guidance could enhance this process and strengthen multi-sector action and impact measurement to address NCDs within LLMICs. These improvements would also help to standardize reporting and expand the research field. As a growing number of development interventions impact on NCDs to achieve the SDGs, the evaluation of NCD outcomes and publication of results within academic literature is highly encouraged to promote best practice and inform effective resource allocation.']"
2018-05-16T00:00:00Z,The hidden costs: Identification of indirect costs associated with acute gastrointestinal illness in an Inuit community,"['This study used a mixed methods design to identify and characterize the indirect costs associated with AGI in Rigolet, Canada. Although there is a well-developed literature on cost-of-illness methods and estimates, few studies examine the costs of illness from a setting-specific perspective or in settings where an acute illness occurs chronically over time in the population, resulting in studies overlooking many important indirect cost contributors. The findings from this study emphasize the importance of considering the numerous indirect cost contributors of AGI in Inuit communities that are perpetuating existing Inuit health inequities, including the economic impacts of missed paid employment, missed subsistence activities, altered diet, decreased mental well-being, decreased social welfare, and seasonality. The results were used to develop a case-based indirect cost-of-illness study framework that accounts for all reported cost contributors, and could be adapted for other Inuit communities and self-limiting illnesses. Using this more comprehensive cost-of-illness study framework, public health decision-makers could obtain a more accurate estimate of the costs of illness within a community, and develop and prioritize funding, policies, and programs accordingly.This study presents one approach to guide future case-based studies, offering a micro-level understanding of the costs of illness in a specific setting. This approach should be extended to other health research locations to gain a clearer understanding of the various costs of illness in different settings. Although this study offers important information on the indirect costs of illness borne by individuals in Rigolet, future research is needed to quantify these costs and to understand how these costs compare to those in other settings.']"

When controlling for environmental and genetic variability, shifting microbial communities were detected in a single population of channel catfish across fish age; however, the required changes in dietary formulations across development is likely to have influenced microbiota composition as well. Despite these shifts of the gut microbiota, shared bacteria were also identified across fish age, with Cetobacterium somerae found to be a dominant bacterial species in the intestinal tract of catfish after the larval stage, irrelevant of age. And while pathogenic bacterial taxa were detected at each time point, fish exhibited no signs of disease suggesting those pathogenic bacteria may be commensal microorganisms that are opportunistically pathogenic only when the host’s physiology deviates from homeostasis. In addition, we showed that the intestinal microbiota of channel catfish are distinct from the surrounding environmental microbiota. However, the environment (diet and water-supply) likely serves as an inoculum to the fish gut, as there were shared taxa between intestinal and environmental samples as well. The results of this study have implications on the applied management of catfish aquaculture and currently represent the only temporal characterization of the gut microbiota of channel catfish. Our results highlight the variability in gut microbiota between individuals and age classes as a potential source of variation when conducting other research on the biology and culture of these commercially valuable fish, as well as serve as a reference for future research on pre- and probiotic supplementation in catfish. Furthermore, these results help increase our basic understanding of temporal variation in the microbial composition dynamics in the gastrointestinal tract of teleost fish.']"
2017-02-15T00:00:00Z,Ecological networks to unravel the routes to horizontal transposon transfers,"['Here we argue that the conceptual framework and methodological tools provided by network theory can shed new light on the process of HTT. Applying this approach is becoming increasingly feasible thanks to the affordability of genome sequencing and the exponential accumulation of genome sequence data for a wide range of organisms (outside of model species). This outpouring of genome sequence data, together with new analytical tools to systematically detect HTT [12,18,95], should soon enable the placement of a large number of HTT events across a dense network of species, as well as the assembly of an empirical HTT matrix. The increasing availability of public databases on relationships between eukaryotic species as well as their relationships with their microbial communities (e.g., DNA-based diet analysis, host–vector relationship, virome, and microbiome) will allow further exploration of the role of these factors in shaping the HTT network and ultimately the evolutionary dynamics of TEs.The application of network theory in ecology has yielded profound new insights into the dynamics of communities and ecosystem processes from the properties of interacting organisms [96,97]. We argue that this approach can be adapted to provide a new conceptual framework and methodology to unravel the dynamics of TE movements between eukaryotic species, with TEs being virtually ubiquitous throughout the tree of life. The development of HTT networks will promote cross-disciplinary insights and the merging of concepts and knowledge borrowed from a vast array of biological areas, including ecology, genetics, genomics, cell biology, virology, bacteriology, and parasitology. Such an integrative approach will open up new avenues to perform and interpret large-scale analyses of genome composition resulting from HTT and, consequently, to better understand a pivotal process in the evolution of multicellular eukaryotes.']"
2019-08-20T00:00:00Z,Relationships between feeding and microbial faeces indices in dairy cows at different milk yield levels,"['The higher concentrations of NDF and ADF in the diet of non-lactating cows led to higher concentrations of cellulose and lignin in their faeces. The change in quality was accompanied by higher ratios of G+/G- bacteria, based on PLFA analysis, and higher concentrations of fungi, based on fungal GlcN and ergosterol analysis. Milk yield × farm interactions indicate that the farm-specific variability in feedstock quality is too strong to assess the effects of small differences on the faecal microbiome composition. In the near future, it will be easier to separate differences in feedstock quality between low yielding and high yielding lactating groups with costly and labour-intensive molecular biomarkers under the fully controlled conditions of an experimental farm. However, NIRS estimates of N and C fractions were able to model microbial and especially fungal biomarkers successfully, so that the N2O emission potential and the fertilizer value of cow faeces can be predicted from considerably larger sample sets under practical farming conditions.Averaging all data, concentrations of MBC by fumigation extraction and MC by amino sugar analysis were on a similar level, suggesting that both methods in principle give reliable information on faecal microbial biomass. Amino sugar analysis has the advantage that this approach can be carried out in dried samples. However, feedstuff-induced changes in microbial community structure affected conversion of MurN to bacterial C as well as of chloroform-labile C and N to MBC and MBN, respectively. The view of the prokaryotic microbiome created by PLFA and archaeol analysis strongly differs from that of DNA based methods, pointing to a need for further improvement of all methodological approaches currently available. This is also true for eukaryotic microbiome, as fungi apparently contribute a considerable percentage of approximately 20% to the faecal microbiome, which requires more attention in the future.']"
2019-04-03T00:00:00Z,The toxicity of coated silver nanoparticles to Daphnia carinata and trophic transfer from alga Raphidocelis subcapitata,"['The type of AgNP coating and medium significantly influenced the degree of aggregation and the behaviour of AgNPs. Based on the 48 h EC50 values of D. carinata, we found that the Ag+ ions are significantly more toxic than AgNPs. The toxicity of E-AgNP and C-AgNP were not significantly different, but T-AgNPs were comparatively about 2.5 times less toxic. Since other characteristics such as shape, size and charge are quite similar, the difference in toxicity could be attributed to the effect of different coatings. Feeding experiments revealed that the ingestion rates of NP treated algae were significantly lower than untreated algae revealing associated AgNPs with algae change daphnid feeding behaviour which could have longer term negative effects on D. carinata population. However, findings from this study are not sufficient to conclude the cause of changed behaviour. Ingestion rates of algae treated with differently coated NPs were not markedly different showing that different types of coatings had little effect on D. carinata feeding. Our findings also demonstrated the diet-borne transfer of AgNPs from AgNP contaminated R. subcapitata to D. carinata. In the algae exposed to AgNPs, T-AgNP bioaccumulation was the highest while C-AgNPs were the lowest. However, bioaccumulation of Ag in daphnids through trophic transfer did not correlate with the accumulation profiles of Ag in algal cells. The percentage Ag retained in daphnids was highest for T-AgNP treated algae while it is lowest for C-AgNPs. These results demonstrate that type of coating may have effects on AgNP accumulation profiles at different trophic levels. The behaviour of differently coated NPs in medium, their toxicity profile and trophic transfer data generated in this study demonstrate the importance of considering type of coating in environmental risk assessment.']"
2015-08-14T00:00:00Z,Trend of Narratives in the Age of Misinformation,"['Conspiracy theories are considered to belong to false beliefs overlooking the pervasive unintended consequences of political and social action. Social media fostered the production of an impressive amount of rumors, mistrust, and conspiracy-like narratives aimed at explaining (and oversimplifying) reality and its phenomena. Such a scenario provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the dynamics of topics emergence, production, and popularity. Indeed, in this work we focus on how conspiracy contents are consumed in the Italian Facebook.The understanding of consumption patterns behind unsubstantiated claims might provide important insight both at the level of popularity of topics as well as to prevent misinformation spreading. Users activity in terms of likes and comments on posts belonging to different categories are similar and resolves in similar information consumption patterns. Conversely, if we focus on the lifetime—i.e., the distance in time between the first and the last comment for each user—we notice a remarkable difference within topics. Users polarized on geopolitics subjects are the most persistent in commenting, whereas the less persistent users are those focused on diet narratives. Finally we focus on the mobility of users across the different semantic categories. In particular, we address the patterns behind the consumption of different topics with respect to the user’s engagement. Previous works [4, 5] showed that users tend to aggregate around their preferred information and build their own narrative in social echo-chambers. In particular, conspiracy users resulted to be more focused and self-contained on their specific contents. Here we find that, in their own echo-chamber, users can jump independently from one semantic category to another, and such a probability increases with the user engagement (number of likes on a single specific category). Each new like on the same category increases of the 12% the probability to pass to a new one.']"

The small species is about the size of a skunk (Mephitis mephitis) or genet (Genetta genetta) and retains the broad talonid basins and connate metaconids, short upper molar metastyles, and broad upper molar protocones of a generalist carnivore, comparable to those of a skunk or mongoose that supplement a diet of vertebrate prey with arthropods and some fruits, nuts, and other plant material [66, 67]. The distal humeri that are likely attributable to Masrasector nananubis preserve morphology that is consistent with the species having been a fast-moving and largely terrestrial carnivore; this conclusion is supported by multivariate morphometric analysis of distal humeral morphology.Masrasector is resolved by Bayesian and parsimony phylogenetic analysis within the Afro-Arabian clade Teratodontinae. Teratodontines are closely related to Hyainailouridae (Apterodontinae + Hyainailourinae) and “indohyaenodontines,” but the relationships between Hyainailouridae, Teratodontinae, and Indohyaenodontinae differ depending on the phylogenetic method. A closer relationship of Teratodontinae to Hyainailouridae than to Hyaenodontinae or Proviverrinae is supported by the shared presence of a distinctive nuchal crest that narrows to the foramen magnum, an elongate neurocranium that lacks distinct postorbital processes, and a mid-cranium constriction of the parietals.The cranium of Masrasector nananubis is the oldest known from an Afro-Arabian hyaenodont. Coupled with the extensive sample of dentaries and referred humeral specimens, Masrasector nananubis is one of the most complete Afro-Arabian hyaenodonts aside from Apterodon. With a large sample of specimens and a detailed record of multiple anatomical regions, Masrasector now shifts from being a fragmentary problem taxon to a cornerstone of character development for all future studies that explore the evolutionary history and ecological diversity of Hyaenodonta.']"
2017-04-18T00:00:00Z,"Stronger diversity effects with increased environmental stress: A study of multitrophic interactions between oak, powdery mildew and ladybirds","['In this study, we found evidence of mitigating effects of species richness on oak PM, being modulated by environmental factors. These modulated mitigating effects were linked to multitrophic interactions with a mycophagous ladybird, which seemed to prefer feeding on infected leaves from trees with lower water status under laboratory conditions. These findings are in line with expectations of how the Stress Gradient Hypothesis interacts with positive effects of species richness on ecosystem functioning, in this case the mitigation of pathogen infection severity through trophic control. Previous studies have found little response of PM infections to dry or wet meteorological conditions, other than physical inhibition of spore germination by rain drops, and conflicting results for the effects of neighbourhood tree species richness on PM infections, but our results suggest that the same may not hold for ladybird mycophagous activity. Interactions between plant hormonal responses to abiotic and biotic stressors may explain this environmental modulation of trophic control, but more research is needed to elucidate these mechanisms. The substantial mycophagy rates we noted in both our field and lab study suggest that these mycophagous ladybirds may play a considerable role in mitigating the impact of oak powdery mildew. While we did not find a significant relationship between species composition and PM levels, our results suggest that mixing tree species may have a mitigating effect through enhanced ladybird activity under drier climatic conditions. In addition, given our observations in the field and during our lab study, promoting the presence of plant species vulnerable to other powdery mildew species, such as Heracleum sphondylium and Sonchus oleraceus, may strengthen ladybird activity by increasing their numbers and allow them to mix their diet.']"
2017-08-10T00:00:00Z,Ranking 93 health interventions for low- and middle-income countries by cost-effectiveness,"['Cost-effectiveness is not the only criterion on which to choose health priorities, however it is useful for identifying what is given up when a less cost-effective intervention is prioritized. It is also a useful tool for advocacy for increased health budgets. This survey has used cost-effectiveness measures from several hundred studies for LMICs to help identify candidates for priority health packages, which may assist policymakers considering how to move to universal healthcare coverage. Comparisons with a similar analysis just over a decade ago demonstrate the degree of change that has occurred.This survey has identified some of the gaps where future research on cost-effectiveness is needed. Given the ongoing decline in infectious disease burden and the growing burden of NCDs, more analyses for NCDs are needed for LMICs. It will not be possible to achieve the aim of health convergence within a generation without initiating interventions to reduce NCDs (where the lag between intervention and outcomes is often much longer than for infectious diseases). The survey highlights the lack of any study of cost-effectiveness for childhood cancer and the dearth of information on cost-effective interventions for mental health in LMICs. Another area for future work includes the cost-effectiveness of resource-appropriate treatment of early-stage cancers (such as breast and cervical). Given the growth of obesity worldwide, cost-effectiveness studies of interventions to change patterns of diet and inactivity in urban areas are needed. A new (as of March 2016) publicly-available online global database of cost-effectiveness studies using DALY outcomes will make future updates easier [26].The major changes in ranking of health priorities over the past decade, underscore the need for periodic repetition of “league table” exercises such as this.']"
2019-07-31T00:00:00Z,Past aquatic environments in the Levant inferred from stable isotope compositions of carbonate and phosphate in fish teeth,"['The environmental history of fish ecosystems in the southeast Mediterranean during the Early to Late Holocene was studied by investigating the stable isotope composition of Sparidae tooth enameloid. The provenance of Sparidae from marine versus hypersaline lagoonal water was recorded in the δ18OPO4, δ18OCO3 and δ13C values of modern and ancient fish teeth, which reflects the wide range of saline habitats encountered during their migratory life cycle. The enameloid δ18OCO3 as well as the Δδ18OCO3-PO4 offset and δ13C values of Holocene Sparidae teeth from the Levant are consistent with those of modern fish, indicating only minor diagenetic alteration. The δ13C of Sparidae tooth enameloid reflects the water DIC of the fish habitat and its diet. Thus, carbon cycling in past fish environments can be characterised using the δ13C of fish teeth.Paired δ18OPO4-δ13C and δ18OCO3-δ13C values of ancient Sparidae tooth enameloid were used to infer the environmental history of fish from coastal and lagoonal settings in the Levant. Our results indicate that Late Holocene hypersaline lagoons evolved from typical southeast Mediterranean coastal water under high rates of evaporation and limited carbon input from terrestrial sources. This lagoon formation occurred in association with the postglacial stabilisation of the sea level about 3,500 years ago, however, first lagoons had already formed during the Early Holocene and were likely influenced by freshwater input. Overall, the pairing of δ18OPO4-δ13C and δ18OCO3-δ13C of fish tooth enameloid is therefore, a potential tool to infer past hydrological balance and environmental shifts of fish ecosystems. This enables us to gain new insights into past fishing grounds that were exploited by (pre-)historic humans.']"
2013-09-30T00:00:00Z,New Specimens of the Rare Taeniodont Wortmania (Mammalia: Eutheria) from the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and Comments on the Phylogeny and Functional Morphology of “Archaic” Mammals,"['Three new specimens of the rare early Paleocene taeniodont Wortmania otariidens are described here. These include one of the most complete cranial specimens known for the species, which is the first Wortmania specimen to include associated upper and lower teeth, and another fossil that is only the second known specimen that includes postcranial remains. These specimens provide new anatomical information on this rare genus, which was one of the first mammals to evolve moderately large size and extreme functional adaptations (for scratch-digging and a high-wear diet) after the extinction of the dinosaurs (Figure 15). This new information allows for comparison with other, more fragmentary taeniodont specimens and leads us to conclude that Robertschochia sullivani is a junior synonym of Wortmania otariidens. These specimens also provide new data with which to examine taeniodont phylogeny and functional morphology. A revised version of a published phylogenetic analyses of Taeniodonta, which incorporates new morphological data from the new specimens, suggests that “Conoryctidae”, a previously proposed clade of small, taeniodonts with supposedly “generalized” skeletons, is monophyletic, but this clade is only found with ordered characters and falls apart when unordered characters are used. Wortmania, is placed within the subclade Stylinodontidae, a group of larger-bodied and more robust taeniodonts, as previously proposed. Preliminary analysis also suggests that all taeniodonts for which postcrania are known possess at least some postcranial adaptations for scratch-digging, and that Wortmania was somewhat intermediate in its digging capabilities between more generalized and gracile taxa such as Onychodectes and the largest, most robust stylinodontids such as Stylinodon and Psittacotherium.\n\t\t\t\t10.1371/journal.pone.0075886.g015Figure 15\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tReconstruction of Wortmania otariidens.\n\t\t\t\t\tArtwork by Matt Celeskey, 2012.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t']"
2017-05-03T00:00:00Z,The environment as a driver of immune and endocrine responses in dolphins (Tursiops truncatus),"['Using a complex suite of endocrine and immune parameters, the cross-population comparisons assessed in this study provide insight into the differences in immune and endocrine parameters between groups of dolphins living under disparate environmental conditions. Overall, the differences found in immune parameters appear to reflect differences in the environmental conditions under which these four dolphin populations live reflective of their exposures to pathogens and foreign antigens. As expected, the largest differences were found between managed-care groups and wild dolphins reflective of the different environments in which they live and the veterinary care and diet supplied under managed-care conditions. The major differences occurred in the immune measurements. The findings related to the endocrine system were less easy to interpret since environmental variables such as water temperature and collection methods, factors that influence -measured hormones, varied between the populations.Collectively, these data indicate that the environment shapes the immune and endocrine responses in dolphins. Many of the differences found between managed-care dolphins and wild dolphins are consistent with their environments and associated pathogenic antigenic stimulation. On the other hand, the biological significance of these differences cannot be determined; many of the statistically significant differences may not be accompanied by a biologically significant response or health effect. A more robust understanding of the effects of environmental variables such as pathogen exposure on immune function may be obtained by further studies assessing how basic immune defenses differ between wild and managed-care animals. A greater understanding of the interplay between the dolphins’ endocrine and immune systems and the role of such interactions in clinically relevant responses may provide valuable insights into how disruption within one or more of these compartments may influence the dolphins’ ability to regulate inflammation and disease processes.']"
2014-11-07T00:00:00Z,Metabolomics as a Tool for Discovery of Biomarkers of Autism Spectrum Disorder in the Blood Plasma of Children,"['This initial study provides proof of concept to further pursue development of metabolic biomarkers of ASD. We have demonstrated that a profile of altered metabolites in the blood plasma from a well-curated sample set from clinically diagnosed children with ASD and TD individuals between 4 and 6 years of age, can be detected by a combination of several MS-based metabolomic analyses. Statistical models developed from the derived metabolic data distinguished children with ASD from TD individuals with better than 80% accuracy in both the 61-sample training set and the 21 sample validation set.The broad metabolite profiling methods developed here can also be employed to discover a wide variety of additional metabolites, leading to the determination of biochemical pathways and mechanisms that are involved in the etiologies of ASD, and advancing the understanding of autism in broader patient populations, eventually leading to new modes of therapy. Given the pronounced clinical and co-morbid features of ASD, it is possible that metabolic profiling of individual patients may enable individualized therapeutic approaches for improved outcomes.\nFuture Endeavors\nFurther research is currently being carried out in much larger and younger patient populations to confirm these results, discover and confirm additional diagnostic metabolites and determine which are the most robust for evaluating ASD risk. We are also comparing metabolite profiles in clinically defined subtypes of ASD to determine whether predictive accuracy can be increased through better phenotyping of the ASD population. Analysis and consequential stratification will be performed based on covariables such as medication, sex, special diet, race, ethnicity, onset and co-morbid features such as gastrointestinal distress or seizure disorders may lead to a more accurate set of diagnostic metabolic profiles.\n']"
2014-04-30T00:00:00Z,Influence of Molting and Starvation on Digestive Enzyme Activities and Energy Storage in Gammarus fossarum,"['The present study assessed the effects of physiological parameters (gender and female reproductive cycle) and food availability on two energy metabolic responses (digestive enzyme activities and Ea) in G. fossarum. This ecophysiological study of Gammarus fossarum provides novel biological information, which will facilitate a better understanding of the physiological and biochemical responses of gammarids. These data could also help to understand energy metabolism in gammarids. We determined the effects of the reproductive cycle on the activities of digestive enzyme and Ea in females, and highlighted the more stable responses found in males. In female gammarids, two hypotheses may explain the fluctuations in their digestive activities and energy storage levels: (i) physiological events (molt, oogenesis, and spawning) and (ii) reproductive behavior (amplexus). We also demonstrated the effects of food on the digestive activities and energy outcomes in both genders. First, the effect of the food quantity was illustrated by higher amylase activity levels when more food was available. Second, the effect of food quality was highlighted by the stable trypsin activity level in organisms fed a monospecific vegetable diet with no protein supplements. Given the responses of these biomarkers, we suggest that the experimental designs used in field studies should aim to reduce the effects of these parameters, which are possible confounding factors in active biomonitoring. To limit the effects of physiological processes (such as molt and reproduction) on the biological responses being studied, we advocate the use of calibrated males. In the field, the possible differences in the trophic levels among study sites could be limited by using caging approaches, where the organisms are fed ad libitum. In conclusion, our results confirm that males fed ad libitum can be used in different active biomonitoring studies [9], [10], where their metabolic responses can serve as biomarkers.']"
2013-12-18T00:00:00Z,From Food Insufficiency towards Trade Dependency: A Historical Analysis of Global Food Availability,"['In this article, we investigated past global trends in food availability by quantifying country-level dietary energy supply and production during 1965–2005. Further, we examined how food self-sufficiency has developed globally, and analysed the role of food trade in improving food security. We found that food availability has improved considerably while food self-sufficiency has remained relatively low during the entire study period. Trade of food products has, thus, soared in importance in securing an adequate food supply. In many parts of the world, diets are increasingly abundant in calories and animal source foods.Within the past 50 years, the world has thus moved from food insufficiency towards an increasing dependency on food trade. This has improved food availability, but mainly in regions with a sufficiently strong economy to be a notable player in the trade markets. While a secure food supply has been intentionally outsourced in various parts of the globe, a large share of global population is still living with insufficient food supply. Food security is not merely a question of food availability but increasingly also a question of access to food. At global scale food supply would be sufficient to feed the entire population but its uneven distribution leaves a notable proportion of population food insecure while others live in abundance of food. Thus, while global food supply could be increased by e.g. novel technological solutions, reform of current agricultural practices and reduction of food waste [4], [55], any substantial improvement in food security will require real efforts for a more equal distribution of global food supply.']"

Almost 50% of the weight loss effect of MnTBAP is due to decreased caloric intake and, unlike other metalloporphyrins, appears to be independent of HO-1. Further, the decrease in adiposity following MnTBAP treatment appears to contribute to enhanced insulin sensitivity, an effect that may mediated by tissue-specific changes in PKB content and phosphorylation. Overall, these data demonstrate that MnTBAP promotes weight loss and enhances insulin action by reducing caloric intake and increasing PKB activity. In conclusion, our results indicate that MnTBAP and possibly other SOD mimetics not only offer a new treatment strategy for obesity and insulin resistance, but may also prove effective against muscle wasting conditions where PKB activity is impaired.Obesity and insulin resistance have both been associated with the over-production of ROS and oxidative stress [4]. This association led to investigations that demonstrated improved insulin action by enhancing the antioxidant defense system [5–8]. Although antioxidants can reduce oxidative stress and improve insulin action [5,6,8], this effect was thought to be independent of changes in adiposity until Pires et al. [15] recently demonstrated that MnTBAP reduced ROS and prevented weight gain during a short-term HFD regimen in lean mice. The present study expands the work of Pires et al [15] by showing MnTBAP reverses pre-existing obesity following long-term HFD feeding. Taken together, Pires et al and the present study establish MnTBAP and possibly other SOD mimetics as a new avenue for the treatment of obesity.']"
2015-06-10T00:00:00Z,"Effects of Row-Type, Row-Spacing, Seeding Rate, Soil-Type, and Cultivar Differences on Soybean Seed Nutrition under US Mississippi Delta Conditions","['This research demonstrated that increasing seeding rate resulted in increases of protein, linolenic acid, sucrose, glucose, raffinose, B, and P concentrations on both single- and twin-rows. However, the increase of these constituents became either constant or declined at the higher rates (40 and 50 seeds m–2). A later maturity cultivar (GP 533) accumulated higher seed protein and linolenic acid than the earlier maturity cultivar (94M80) on both row- types under normal conditions of temperature and drought. However, the earlier maturity cultivar (94M80) accumulated higher oil and oleic acid concentrations in seeds. The positive correlation between sucrose and glucose with SR in single- and twin-rows in 2009 and 2010 in clay soil and sandy soil indicated that these sugars were the most influenced by seeding rates, and the negative correlation between SR and stachyose may be due to a possible inverse relationship between stachyose, and sucrose, glucose, and fructose, especially under environmental stress conditions of heat and drought. Since the positive response of seed protein, sugars, and minerals was between 20 and 40 seed m-2, SR beyond 40 seed m-2 may have a negative impact on seed quality as they create inter-plant competition for water and nutrients. Since we used limited cultivars in our study, we cannot generalize the trend of seed nutrients obtained in this experiment to be shown by other cultivars unless a big number of cultivars with different maturity groups and genotypes are used. These results are useful to soybean growers for optimizing agronomic practices for higher seed quality. Since higher seed protein and sugars, especially sucrose, glucose, and fructose, are desirable traits for soybean nutrition and taste, optimizing seeding rate to achieve higher levels of these seed constituents is an important goal for soybean industry, and needs further research.']"

Differences were found when volunteer’s people were at work. Most probably office workers compensate for the lack of physical activity during business hours in their free time.To our knowledge this is the first comparative approach to shift and non-shift workers employed in the health care industry with regard to their physical activity, nutrition, metabolism, chronic stress and sleep. These findings and range of parameters have not been described in a central European cohort yet.Shift-working had no overall effect on physical activity but was associated with different eating habits and greater stress levels. Office workers appear to compensate for less physical activity during work in their off hours.Further studies should enrol a larger sample size and longer periods of monitoring, e.g. four weeks. Advanced developments like smaller and lighter fitness-tracking armbands could be used as actigraphy in future studies to encourage study participation. The relation between shift work and impairment should always be noted by comparing shift-working and non-shift-working study groups of similar working environment (e.g. health-care workers).The amount of MVPA and overall activity measured by METs should be used in future studies due to their clinical relevance and reproducibility.Considering the theoretical foundation of this study—the biopsychosocial model- further studies should also acquire data about e.g. individual education, social status, income etc. By obtaining a larger and more representative sample size, evaluation of shift-work’s retrospective impact on social parameters such as family structure, career could be realized.']"
2013-09-04T00:00:00Z,Metagenomic Profiling Reveals Lignocellulose Degrading System in a Microbial Community Associated with a Wood-Feeding Beetle,"['This study represents the first large scale functional metagenomic analysis of the midgut microbial community of a cerambycid beetle with documented lignin degrading capabilities [8]. A taxonomically diverse assemblage of bacteria and fungi are associated with the midgut of A. glabripennis and this study has shown that this community harbors the enzymatic capacity for extensive contributions to the digestion of woody tissue in this system. Of relevance is i) a microbial community dominated by bacterial and fungal aerobes and facultative anaerobes, indicating an appropriate aerobic environment in the midgut for microbial enzymes involved in oxygen-dependent lignin degradative processes, ii) the similarity of the A. glabripennis midgut microbiota to the Sirex fungal gallery community and its distinction from other herbivore gut communities, including the termite hindgut communities, iii) detection of genes encoding secreted oxidative enzymes proposed to disrupt β-aryl ether linkages and hypothesized to have roles in cleaving β-aryl ether linkages in lignin, iv) detection of extracellular H2O2-generating enzymes, and v) detection of a number of genera with predicted lignocellulolytic and hemicellulolytic capabilities. The midgut community of A. glabripennis has the metabolic potential to produce enzymes to help this wood-boring insect overcome major nutritional challenges associated with feeding in woody tissue and we hypothesize that interactions between the beetle and its gut microbes drive this insect’s ability to colonize and thrive in a broad range of healthy host trees. This wood-degrading system should also have great potential for the development of novel lignocellulose degrading enzymes for applications by the biofuels industry. This study provides the first glimpse into the metabolic potential of the gut community associated with a cerambycid beetle and lays the foundations for future hypothesis-based research, including more in-depth biochemical studies, comparative metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and pathway modeling to assess potential metabolic cross-talk between this beetle and its gut microbes.']"
2015-06-02T00:00:00Z,How Are Physical Activity Behaviors and Cardiovascular Risk Factors Associated with Characteristics of the Built and Social Residential Environment?,"[""While there is increasing evidence for the effect of the built residential characteristics on the PA behavior of individuals, the influence of the social environment and the simultaneous evaluation of multiple risk behaviors/risk factors has received less attention to date. The present study attempted to fill this gap by deliberately including social characteristics in the study design and investigating smoking and nutritional behavior—two central behavioral dimensions of the participants' cardiovascular risk factor profiles-, BMI and fasting blood glucose as well as PA behavior. While the present study does not encompass a complete cardiovascular risk factor profile, we captured many of the most important risk factors and found most of them to be associated with characteristics of the built and social residential environment.While there exists a growing amount of studies investigating possible links between both built and social residential characteristics and PA behavior, the number of articles on the influence of neighborhood characteristics on other cardiovascular risk factors, e.g. BMI or fasting blood glucose, remains small. Future studies should embrace a greater variety of cardiovascular risk behaviors/risk factors in order to elucidate the complete array of (causal) pathways between residential characteristics and risk factors.Moreover, future research should focus on integrating both innovative objective and subjective measures for characteristics of the residential environment. As a majority of the existing evidence documenting associations between characteristics of the residential environment and risk factors as well as risk behaviors is mainly cross-sectional [40], future research should use prospective longitudinal designs or natural experiments in order to be able to acquire knowledge about causal links rather than merely about observed associations. With the ultimate goal of our research in mind—solving real-world problems—future research should last but not least strive to draw conclusions in such a way that they can more easily serve as guidelines for political decision makers.""]"
2015-05-04T00:00:00Z,Metabolic Heat Stress Adaption in Transition Cows: Differences in Macronutrient Oxidation between Late-Gestating and Early-Lactating German Holstein Dairy Cows,"['The objective of the present study was to compare the macronutrient oxidation in late-gestating versus early-lactating dairy cows fed either ad libitum during high ambient temperatures or pair-fed at thermoneutrality. Earlier studies utilizing the pair-feeding approach [12–14] focused on mid-lactating cows which are highly susceptible to heat stress at their maximum of milk production. In contrast, our focus was set on the transition cow, because the transition phase is not only a vulnerable period, but highly determinative for the subsequent lactation. To gain novel insights into the oxidative metabolism of different macronutrients during heat stress and pair-feeding beyond the level of metabolite analysis, we applied the technique of indirect calorimetry. We could demonstrate that fat oxidation is not affected by heat-induced reduction of feed intake in both, late-gestating and early-lactating cows despite a different lipolytic response. Moreover, cows under high ambient temperatures exhibited a metabolic shift towards a pronounced carbohydrate oxidation. To provide a sufficient supply of carbohydrate precursors under hot thermal conditions, these cows extensively degrade tissue protein reflected in the response of plasma urea, creatinine and methyl histidine concentrations. However, the acute metabolic heat response in late-gestating dry cows seems to differ from early-lactating cows as the prepartal adipose tissue is not refractory to lipolytic signals which were present in both stages and the degree of amino acid oxidation may be lower than in the postpartal situation. Both differences might be attributed to nutrient requirements of the fast-growing, near-term fetus and to a higher heat tolerance due to a lower endogenous metabolic heat load in dry cows. It might be useful to consider these divergent demands in the development of nutritional strategies for the attenuation of heat stress impairments of dairy health and performance in the future.']"
2017-09-14T00:00:00Z,Dealing with AFLP genotyping errors to reveal genetic structure in Plukenetia volubilis (Euphorbiaceae) in the Peruvian Amazon,"['The comparison of eight datasets showed that it is better to perform variant multiple data filtering by combining several different approaches. Despite the understandable differences, the “Error” datasets (error-2, error-3, error-4, and error-5), showed more consistent results than “RawGeno” datasets (rep-100, rep-150, all-100, and all-150). The estimation of clusters was independent of reproducibility of the underlying dataset. The exception was hierarchical analysis in STRUCTURE where, thanks to the gradual reduction in the number of individuals and markers, the background noise was predominant over the structural signal in datasets with higher error rates. However, noticeable differences were found in the genetic diversity estimation between datasets. Data quality considerably influenced estimates of genetic diversity, which is a concern for conservation genetics.P. volubilis represents a traditional Peruvian oil crop for human nutrition. Recently, a growing interest in this crop has been noted within the food and pharmaceutical industry. Breeding of sacha inchi allows for improvements in the required characteristics, but for the successful creation of varieties it is necessary to learn about its genetic diversity and variability. Our study showed that, due to long-term phenotypic selection and low gene flow, P. volubilis exists as very isolated subpopulations corresponding with the sampling localities. The degree of differentiation between the subpopulations is probably due more to socio-economic connectivity among the sites than to biological connection, because seeds are transported over different distances. Using the AFLP technique and appropriate filtering data and estimation of error rate can be successfully applied for genetic structure estimation. For the first stage of the breeding process, it would be interesting to create a collection of samples originating from neighboring localities. However, questions remain regarding the degree of variability within loci affected by selection for the desired phenotype. Answers could be provided by association studies aiming to identify these loci.']"
2017-03-28T00:00:00Z,In vitro skin models to study epithelial regeneration from the hair follicle,"['Skin models are useful tools to study various aspects of skin biology, physiology, renewal, wound repair and regeneration and skin diseases. However, it should be noted that they do not mimic every element of native skin nor do they replace all of its functions. These models are deprived of essential communication with the rest of the body including neuroendocrine communications that play an integral role as central regulators of body homeostasis [44, 45]. They also lack functional immune system and regulation and, blood flow important for cellular nutrition and metabolism [46]. The development of an ideal, fully functional skin model has therefore not been attained yet. However, over the years, ongoing research into the cellular and molecular mechanisms which govern the various processes during skin development, repair, renewal and regeneration has led to major advancements in the construction of these skin models that more closely resemble native skin by the incorporation of a variety of cell types including neuronal cells [47], immune cells, melanocytes, endothelial cells, and hair follicle-like structures [48, 49].In this study, we have established an in vitro skin model that mimics the conditions in vivo to study epithelial/mesenchymal interactions and epithelial regeneration from hair follicles. Both DEs supported the initial maintenance of implanted hair follicles, in particular PSU. These follicles provided progenitor epithelial cells that generated epidermis only in DED skin equivalents similar to in vivo. The skin equivalents implanted with PSU were our model of choice. A superior morphology was associated with DED skin equivalent implanted with PSU in vitro. Based on our in vitro and in vivo studies, we conclude that micrografting of PSU into tissue engineered skin may highlight an alternative method to skin grafting of full-thickness wounds. This could be the way forward for the treatment of wounds, potentially saving time and split-skin donor sites.']"
2013-10-08T00:00:00Z,"Obesity and Association with Area of Residence, Gender and Socio-Economic Factors in Algerian and Tunisian Adults","['The aim of the present study was to compare Algeria and Tunisia regarding the prevalence of obesity and its associated socio-economic factors, in the context of the large-scale trends of globalization, modernization and societal changes that both countries are currently experiencing [1]. The nutrition transition appears more advanced in Tunisia: while both countries showed a high prevalence of overweight and obesity (especially among women), the overall burden of overweight and obesity was somewhat higher in Tunisia. As well, in Algeria there was to some extent a double burden of malnutrition [52] at the national level, because thinness was persistent among men. We showed a similar high gender obesity gap in both countries, as women were much more corpulent than men. This was likely due to the similar socio-cultural gender-related issues common to countries in the region, although differences exist between the two countries in the relationship between marital status and obesity. We also highlighted country-specific environmental and socio-economic patterning of corpulence by showing that the relationship with area of residence (urban/rural) and household welfare was much more marked in Tunisia. Nevertheless in both countries even among the poorest households, a fifth of the women were obese. Taking into account the developmental origins of obesity, this could foreshadow an even higher burden of obesity among the poorest in the subsequent generations, in turn fuelling even larger inequalities in health [3]. The observed similarities and differences should be taken into consideration for managing the heavy burden of overweight, obesity and related NCDs in the two countries. Prevention of obesity, especially among women, is a major public health issue in both Tunisia and Algeria, though with country-specific issues regarding the management of obesity inequalities (here associated with area of residence or socio-economic position) that should be taken into account when devising national obesity policies [53].']"
2015-09-02T00:00:00Z,A Single Dynamic Metabolic Model Can Describe mAb Producing CHO Cell Batch and Fed-Batch Cultures on Different Culture Media,"['In this work, we have further developed, accounting for the regulation of glycolysis, and adapted a kinetic metabolic model previously described for other CHO cell lines. The model was challenged with experimental data from two different culture media used in batch and fed-batch cultures. In such model, the initial conditions and the feed composition are the only inputs required to perform culture simulations. A single set of kinetic parameter values allowed describing CHO cell nutritional and metabolic behaviours under batch and fed-batch cultures using two different culture media (Biogro-CHO and PowerCHO-2). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time a metabolic model that includes such a wide array of intracellular concentrations is used to compare culture media and fed-batch strategies for CHO cells. Given its flexible dynamic structure, while the model is cell line-specific, our results suggest that it is not culture medium-specific. In addition to the concentration profiles, given the dynamic nature of the model, we performed a dynamic metabolic flux analysis from model simulation that was in agreement with literature. Model simulations suggest that the cell line used in this study (CHO-DXB11) has a robust metabolism, showing little changes in terms of flux distribution throughout nearly all of the exponential and plateau phase. That metabolism was maintained regardless the medium or the culture mode for most of the culture duration. The fed-batch mode showed stabilizing cell metabolism for an extended period of time. However, sustained amino acids metabolism in fed-batch cultures led to important ammonia accumulation, which may have limited growth while resulting, however, in higher mAb production. We thus believe such model can be further used as an in silico platform and challenged for the identification of optimized medium composition and fed-batch culture strategies, guiding and accelerating bioprocess development steps.']"
2020-02-06T00:00:00Z,Complementary transcriptome and proteome profiling in the mature seeds of Camellia oleifera from Hainan Island,"['Currently, increasing attention has been paid to the health and nutritional benefits of C. oleifera thanks to it being rich in fatty acids. This research was an attempt to systematically investigate the transcriptome and proteome of C. oleifera mature seeds from Hainan Island. A total of 59,391 transcripts, 40,500 unigenes, and 1691 protein species were identified using RNA-seq technology and shotgun proteomic method. Analyses of biological function annotations, correlations from transcriptome to proteome, and protein-protein interactions were also carried out. The results indicated that these specific proteins were divided into 24 groups based on the KOG functional classification, with the great majority being relevant to posttranslational modification, protein turnover and chaperones, carbohydrate transport, and metabolism. Then, the identified proteins were categorized by GO analysis, illustrating that single-organism, cellular, and metabolic processes were the relatively large categories. Furthermore, 823 proteins were mapped to 17 KEGG pathways, and the most abundant proteins were annotated to nucleotide metabolism pathway followed by translation and amino acid metabolism pathways. It was noteworthy that there were 116 proteins related to lipid metabolism, among which 38 specific proteins were involved in protein-protein interactions. The expressions of 21 candidate unigenes encoding target proteins were diverse to different growth stages from the qRT-PCR analysis. Overall, the conjoint analysis of transcriptome and proteome offered a complete picture with regard to the pathways of transport, metabolism, biogenesis, and posttranslational modification. Meanwhile, the study also deepened our understanding of the metabolic networks involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation and paved the way to expedite C. oleifera breeding with higher oil content and better oil quality. Further studies should pay more attention to determine the detailed roles of lipid-associated proteins with unknown specific functions by using differential proteomics techniques.']"
2016-09-19T00:00:00Z,Linkage between Fitness of Yeast Cells and Adenylate Kinase Catalysis,"['Here we report an approach that enables in vivo analysis of effects of perturbations of adenylate kinase catalytic parameters in yeast cells. In the experiments growth rates of cells were quantified in response to Adkeco variants with mutations that “cleanly” perturb the targeted parameters (kcat and KMATP) without compromising the enzyme’s structural integrity or thermal stability. First we showed that cytosolic Adk is required for yeast viability in our strain background, and that a catalytically dead but properly folded variant (K13Q) could not restore viability. These results supports that the relative fitness of the yeast strains is depending on the level of Adk activity. The intracellular ATP concentrations in yeast cells are in the low millimolar range [37–39]. The Michaelis constant is related to the dissociation constant (Kd) for a given substrate, and it has been shown that the Kd of ATP binding to Adkeco is 50 μM [40] which is close to the value of KMATP determined here (~70 μM). With KMATP values used as a proxy for ATP binding affinity it is, in fact, expected that all Adk variants used in this study should be saturated with ATP inside yeast cells since the KMATP values ranging from 34 to 417 μM are below the expected cellular ATP levels. This inference was corroborated with the cell growth experiments since no correlation between relative fitness and KMATP values was observed (Fig 8B). Thus, from a standpoint of KMATP, the Adk variants are all fully functional in the cellular milieu and the growth defects observed in the experiments can be attributed to variations in kcat (determined at 20°C). It was found that yeast cell growth at the optimal temperature (30°C) was not affected by the mutations (except for Adkeco0.0002 with a kcat of 0.06 s-1 that was unable to rescue the inviable phenotype), which is remarkable as the kcat of one of the mutants is only 0.4% compared to wild-type Adk1yeast. In contrast, in response to external stress by growth at a sub-optimal temperature of 20°C the relative fitness of yeast was impaired when the kcat value was less than 7% of the Adk1yeast value. Taken together the data show that the kcat value of Adk1yeast is well above the threshold value required for cell growth under optimal and sub-optimal conditions and that there is substantial overcapacity in the catalytic turn over by Adk in yeast cells. A similar functional dependency of relative fitness with a massive catalytic overcapacity has been observed in E. coli for the enzyme β-galactosidase [15, 41]. Thus, both the present study in a eukaryotic organism and the cited β-galactosidase studies in a prokaryotic organism indicate that only a fraction of evolved enzymatic activity may be required for optimal cell growth under laboratory conditions. The data presented here show that, at least a part of the overcapacity in catalytic power is required for organisms to survive external stress conditions that may apply to organisms in their natural habitats. There exist other ways of inflicting stress conditions to yeast in laboratory growth experiments and examples thereof are; oxidative stress, and nutritional stress. For the conceptual discovery here temperature was chosen since it is a parameter that can be accurately controlled and no additional variables such as nutritional uptake or intracellular concentrations (of for instance hydrogen peroxide in oxidative stress experiments) needs to be considered. Additionally, the plasmid shuffling system developed here is a useful platform in order to promote novel discoveries in Adk enzymology. This can in principle be performed by searching for intragenic suppressor mutations that can revert/save an inviable phenotype dependant on mutation of key catalytic residues. Intragenic suppressor mutations may bypass the effect of the mutation leading to inviability and this bypass effect can generate novel information on, for instance, the plasticity of active sites. A second application to the method lies within enzyme design, here it is possible to make use of the fact that yeast can survive with a very low kcat value at 30°C (Fig 7). One useful experiment that contains significant information on design would be to evolve adenylate kinase activity from an unrelated ATP binding enzyme. Random mutation of the gene encoding this scaffold enzyme followed by transformation into the yeast plasmid shuffling system would generate viable colonies only if adenylate kinase activity has evolved.']"
2016-07-08T00:00:00Z,"The Socioecology of Territory Size and a ""Work-Around"" Hypothesis for the Adoption of Farming","['The intensification of land use is a process associated with the evolution of human societies. How and why intensification occurs and its consequences for social evolution are a matter of intense research. In this paper, I have combined a model of territory size from ecology with cultural evolutionary theory from anthropology to investigate the processes that determine the territory sizes of agricultural societies. I have also proposed a work-around hypothesis for the decision to farm and used this hypothesis to compare the territorial dynamics of forager and farmer societies. The main results are that, consistent with forager societies, the composition of the diet and ethno-linguistic population size determine the territory sizes of agricultural societies. Similarly, the scaling relationship between territory size and population size is sub-linear in agricultural and forager societies. These macroecological patterns are consistent with the work-around hypothesis for the decision to farm.I would like to end by mentioning two important directions for future research. First, we need to compare alternative models that may explain the sub-linear scaling of population and territory size across subsistence types in the first place. This scaling relationship may be the result of a universal law of energy use predicted by a metabolic theory of ecology [17]; alternatively, this scaling relationship might only result under specific technological or social circumstance suggested by social and economic theory [16]; or the sub-linear scaling relationship could be the result of bias in our statistical methods. Second, although the work-around hypothesis presented here is plausible, it needs to be tested against alternative hypotheses. For instance, one alternative is that individuals adopt farming simply because farming allows populations to live in larger groups and individuals recognize that by living larger groups they can generate further economies of scale. In economic parlance, economies of scale create a rising tide that lifts all boats, absent any “market imperfections.”']"
2016-08-12T00:00:00Z,Genetic and Sex-Specific Transgenerational Effects of a High Fat Diet in Drosophila melanogaster,"[""In this study, we found that there was only a moderate link between parental reaction to a high fat diet and their untreated descendants' phenotype, and the associations exhibited extensive genotype-specific reactions. This indicates that there is a potential for deleterious effects to occur in descendants even when the ancestor did not demonstrate a negative reaction to the environmental stress. Additionally, a transgenerational effect in one sex was not a reliable indicator of effects in other related traits. For example, female pupae were affected in some genetic lines while males were not affected (Fig 2).Sex-specific treatment and phenotyping across generations has shown its usefulness in Drosophila, humans, and mice, where the two sexes can perform in dramatically different ways. Sex-specific effects may offset each other and prevent researchers from detecting transgenerational environmental impacts if the sexes are not analyzed separately. Future studies should focus on the elucidation of the sex-specific effects by parsing treatment groups further (e.g. high fat treated maternal grandfather) and phenotyping males and females separately. Additionally, the additive effect of sex should be considered in organisms whose ancestors of both sexes were raised in a high fat background, as in Valtonen et al. [11]. These additional tests will help determine the origin, and thus mechanism, for the transgenerational transmission of dietary information.Finally, the dramatic differences between all genetic lines show the importance of testing multiple genotypes to assess the genetic diversity of a transgenerational trait, since not all genotypes react to the same extent or direction. Epigenetic effects only evaluated in a single genetic background may lead to inaccurate conclusions because of genetic variation in a real population. Awareness of genetic variation for the impact of ancestral environment could provide important insights into the varied causes of the current obesity epidemic.""]"
2018-03-22T00:00:00Z,"From top to bottom: Do Lake Trout diversify along a depth gradient in Great Bear Lake, NT, Canada?","['Rates of speciation for some freshwater fishes are among the highest known for vertebrates, but spatial and temporal distribution of energy and physical habitats, limits the number of species or morphs that can co-exist [92, 136]. However, we do not understand the extent and relative importance of different variables that constrain or promote diversity [137]. Ecological opportunity cannot be the entire story of diversification, because the presence of ecological opportunity has not always led to adaptive radiation, which raises the question whether adaptive radiation can occur in the absence of ecological opportunity [3]. In Great Bear Lake, intraspecific diversity of Lake Trout, with its high phenotypic variation not strongly associated with either horizontal or vertical ecological partitioning axes [27], does not represent the usual pattern of divergence observed within Lake Trout elsewhere or salmonids in general. This lack of correspondence to the ecological theory of adaptive radiation [36, 138, 139] joins examples across a variety of taxa that counter the long-standing hypothesis that specialized morphology corresponds to a specialist diet. Possibly, such situations might be more frequent than previously thought [140]. Multiple niche axes along different environmental gradients appear to structure Lake Trout diversity within Great Bear Lake. If multiple selection axes exist in Great Bear Lake, the question then arises as to whether they favor divergence or counteract each other’s influences? Opportunities to study examples when phenotypic variation is high (fish are really plastic, see e.g., [31, 45, 114]) are useful in understanding the origin and fate of incipient stages of speciation. The ambiguity surrounding the mechanism(s) driving divergence in Lake Trout of Great Bear Lake should be seen as part of the highly variable nature of ecological opportunity and divergent natural selection itself [100, 124].']"
2014-12-31T00:00:00Z,Ecological Changes in Coyotes (Canis latrans) in Response to the Ice Age Megafaunal Extinctions,"['Here we show, on average, Pleistocene coyotes were experiencing stronger dorso-ventral forces on the mandible during feeding and hunting than living coyotes. This suggests that Pleistocene coyotes were hunting larger prey more frequently and incorporating harder food (such as bone) into their diet. While it is possible that coyotes were scavenging more than hunting, the shape of the thickened anterior corpus suggests that they were also hunting with a higher frequency. This anterior mandibular thickening is also seen in modern canid species that hunt large prey with regularity, due to the repeated “leap and bite” strategy that transmits forces from the prey to the front of the face in canids [19], [31]. Additionally, since coyotes are the third most common fossil at the Rancho La Brea tar pits, they were trapped with high frequency, which was the argument for sociality that Carbone et al. [13] used in their study. The prior study by Meachen and Samuels [12] suggested that in the Pleistocene coyotes were larger, more carnivorous, and traveled in social packs. Here, we concur with that finding, and from the shape of the mandibular corpus we also suggest that coyotes were not mainly scavenging, but actively hunting larger prey. Meachen and Samuels [12] showed that the major environmental changes that occurred at the end of the Pleistocene were the major drivers for this change, including possibly both the extinction (Canis dirus) and influx (C. lupus) of other predators and the extinction of many possible prey species.Coyotes have clearly changed since the Pleistocene and in conjunction with the end-Pleistocene extinction events. Present day species interactions between coyotes and gray wolves give us insight into the evolution of the coyote from what it was in the past into what we see today. Extinction events do not just affect the species that go extinct, but also affect many of the species that remain. For coyotes, interactions between closely related competitors are likely the driving force behind major evolutionary changes.']"
2019-03-12T00:00:00Z,Prey availability and temporal partitioning modulate felid coexistence in Neotropical forests,"[""This is the first study providing a large-scale insights into the co-occurrence of five forest hyper-carnivore species throughout the Neotropical region, assessing patterns across protected areas of differing size and intactness. We have shown that jaguar, puma and ocelot exhibit clear spatial preferences at local to landscape scales according to prey availability. We found that prey availability is more important for felid space-use than either landscape variables or species interactions, which likely supports the notion of multi-species convergence on productive prey sites, rather than competitive interactions.Competition was more important in explaining spatial and temporal segregation among jaguars and pumas, than between either of these apex predators and ocelot. Otherwise, interspecific competition played an important role between ocelot and smaller sympatric cats [18], since both the local occupancy and circadian activity rhythms of ocelots affect jaguarundi and margay.A recent global-scale study of co-occurrence of sympatric carnivores found that similar-sized species sharing the same temporal activity patterns and dietary habits were more likely to co-occur than expected by chance [7]. Although, the study used a categorization to describe general activity patterns and diet, not capturing variations on carnivores' behaviour at a particular study area. Indeed, our results showed that some spatial and temporal overlapping may occur, mainly between the three largest species, but go further assessing finer-scale of resource availability and diurnal rhythms, detecting niche partitioning in a local scale and differences in felids’ behaviour across study sites. In this paper, we highlight the importance of understanding the implications of interspecific interactions to conservation and management strategies, particularly in terms of rapidly declining carnivore populations, which may have major impacts on the diversity of lower trophic levels [2].""]"
2017-11-16T00:00:00Z,Climate change mitigation opportunities based on carbon footprint estimates of dietary patterns in Peru,"['As far as the authors were able to ascertain, this is the first study in which an environmental indicator has been estimated for average Peruvian dietary patterns. Results demonstrate that there are certain differences in terms of food intake from a geographical perspective, with distinct food consumption patterns on the northern coast, in the Andean highlands and in the Amazon basin. Considering GHG emissions from the production and distribution of food for household and FAFH consumption, the variation between the average citizens of the cities assessed ranged from 1.0 t to 1.8 t CO2eq.Interestingly, from a socioeconomic point of view, there is a fivefold increase in GHG emissions between the lowest and highest expenditure quintiles for food consumption in the household. The carrying factor for this variation is the fact that lower classes have limited access to high carbon-emission food products such as red meat, and, to a lesser extent, a lower caloric intake per capita. In fact, unlike the current European or North American consumer, higher levels of obesity are found in Peruvian quintiles with higher purchase power.The findings in this study demonstrated that actions in terms of food loss reduction or the substitution of ruminant meat in the diet for other, less carbon intensive, protein rich food products can lower per capita emissions considerably. In fact, some of these actions would imply substantial mitigations of GHG emissions on a national level. However, it should be noted that sustained economic growth and the expansion of the medium class in Peru could cause a substantial increase in the amount of animal protein consumed. When added to population growth and the risk of increased cattle ranching, this increase in animal protein consumption could mean Peru facing a struggle to comply with its international commitments in terms of climate change mitigation unless adequate policies are put in place.']"
2014-10-15T00:00:00Z,Landscape Management of Fire and Grazing Regimes Alters the Fine-Scale Habitat Utilisation by Feral Cats,"['We demonstrate increased predator activity after intense fires and with grazing by large herbivores, which is likely to increase predation rates on small mammals. Small mammals are the preferred prey of cats, and form a substantial part of the diet of cats in the study region (55% of prey volume, from 33 stomach contents; unpublished data). Furthermore, the preference of cats for open and intensely burned areas depended on small-mammal abundance, and was reduced in habitats where abundance of small mammals was low. These patterns of habitat selection by cats correspond with declines of small mammal populations with intensifying fire and/or grazing regimes in mainland northern Australia, outside complex rocky outcrops [20], [21], [22], [54], [55], [56], [57]. Our work supports the hypothesis that the declines in small mammals across northern Australia are driven by cat predation facilitated by simplification of ground layer structure. However, this evidence is not direct, and other possible mechanisms including trophic alterations [25] and disease [19] may still have a role. Further research needs to measure whether mortality of prey is greater in more open areas. Regardless, the magnitude of the impacts of cats globally [58] suggests that our findings provide a general mechanism for prey decline in ecosystems with grass-dominated understoreys.The results presented here suggest that manipulation of habitat through careful management of fire and grazing could be used to reduce impacts of cats over large landscapes. Reducing the frequency of intense fires and removing introduced herbivores is likely to be beneficial for small mammals - especially if this management is focussed on naturally mammal-rich habitats, and if it increases ground cover. Vegetation structure is pivotal in creating ideal landscapes for predators to hunt, and/or refuges for prey to hide.']"
2014-09-10T00:00:00Z,Paleomicrobiology: Revealing Fecal Microbiomes of Ancient Indigenous Cultures,"['We successfully extracted and sequenced DNA from archaeological fecal samples in order to assess possible differences in the fecal communities of individuals from Saladoid and Huecoid indigenous cultures. Our data show that, contrary to common belief, the formation and preservation of coprolites and DNA contained in these coprolites under humid, tropical environments for thousands of years is possible. Not only is the DNA still present, it was also detected by PCR amplification and sequenced successfully. We also demonstrate a clear difference between the fecal microbiota of these two cultures, and therefore variations in terms of their diet and/or genetic heritage. Similar to previous results, our data also supports the hypothesis stating that the Huecoids and Saladoids originated and migrated independently from their respective origins, as opposed to having a common ancestry.This study is one of the first in its kind and we hope will point to the importance of coprolites as important cultural markers and thus any archaeological dig should include the search and preservation of any coprolites found at the sites. This study underlines the importance of such samples for future paleomicrobiological studies. The results have several implications. First, it confirms that coprolites are not completely degraded in humid, tropical environments and thus can be formed under suitable taphonomic conditions. Second, it implies that dietary and/or host genetic differences in ancient populations may be reflected in differences in gut microbiome composition and it confirms that the two indigenous cultures were indeed distinct. Third, it demonstrates that paleomicrobiomics could be a powerful tool to assess dietary, health, genetic and cultural differences between ancient populations. Finally, it implies that these two cultures retained distinct technological/cultural differences during a period of close proximity and peaceful co-existence and suggests that the two populations, at least at this location, may have contributed to form the latter day Taínos, the Amerindians present at the point of Columbian contact.']"
2016-03-09T00:00:00Z,“When Treatment Is More Challenging than the Disease”: A Qualitative Study of MDR-TB Patient Retention,"['We believe this study has important implications for service delivery in MDR-TB. First, accurate treatment education and counseling provided in a non-judgmental manner, that involves family members and garners their support from the outset, is likely to enhance patients’ commitment to treatment and reduce attrition. It is particularly imperative that we introduce these practices preemptively, before the onset of adverse drug effects, so patients and their family members are armed with correct knowledge before they become naturally inclined to discontinue treatment at the first sign of symptom improvement (or the lack thereof). It is also important that counseling be administered through the full course of treatment, as patients’ circumstances and experiences with medications are likely to change over the 1.5–2 years. Second, in relation to the above point, peer support groups may be effective ways to deliver emotional support and enhance treatment literacy, given that MDR-TB patients in India may lack access to emotional support and empathy within their own homes. The impact of social support and peer groups on LFU may be subsequently studied more objectively. Third, financial support by way of conditional grants or monetary incentives should be explored to encourage long-term retention in MDR-TB care, given patients’ dire socioeconomic circumstances and the public health imperative to reduce transmission of drug-resistant strains within the larger community. Nutrition and transport reimbursements have been associated with lower rates of non-adherence [27]. Fourth, there appears to be poor co-ordination and referral between primary health care level workers and Program staff, which may compound the difficulties patients already experience as they navigate the health system. This may be remediated through staff training, capacity building, and expanding communication channels between field DOT providers and district supervisors. Lastly, strengthening public-private partnerships, and communication with traditional healers, is a necessary component of TB service delivery in India given the high rate of medical pluralism.']"
2015-08-26T00:00:00Z,The Effect of Climate Variability on Gray Whales (Eschrichtius robustus) within Their Wintering Areas,"['The evidence suggest that the numbers of MC pairs at OLL are a reflection of the changes in the total number of calves born in the whole population, and these changes in calves’ numbers can be attributed to changes in nutritive condition of females due to temporal changes in the length of the open-water season at their feeding areas, with higher number of calves born after an extended ice-free season, and lower number of calves born after a shorter ice-free season. Our results agree with similar findings by other researchers about polar climate effects on gray whale abundance at their wintering areas. This may be useful for predicting numbers of MC pairs at OLL during the coming season using the sea ice conditions of the previous feeding season (http://pafc.arh.noaa.gov/ice.php).ENSO-related variability in water temperature also influences the wintering distribution of gray whale MC pairs, especially in the southern extreme of their distribution during strong ENSO events, like the 1998 El Niño and 1999 La Niña. This evidence supports the hypothesis that gray whales prefer more southerly areas during years with cold sea temperature (La Niña) and more northerly areas during warmer sea temperatures (El Niño) to reduce thermal-stress and optimize energy utilization for newborn calves and their mothers. This shift in MC pairs could be anticipated with ENSO forecasts (http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/), and it could be useful to predict the numbers of MC pairs at SDCh, an area with intense tourism activity dedicated to whale watching.Indeed, such predictions could be incorporated into the marine ecological program management that is currently being prepared by the Mexican government and the scientific community (http://www.semarnat.gob.mx/temas/ordenamientoecologico/bitacora/Paginas/pacifico_norte.aspx). Moreover, traits of gray whale ecology could be used to track biological consequences of climatic variation in a specific region and time frame under specific ecological conditions.']"
2014-04-01T00:00:00Z,Effects of Salinity and Nutrient Addition on Mangrove Excoecaria agallocha,"['E. agallocha is highly sensitive to salinity, especially at early developmental stages. The favorable salinity range for seed germination is below 5 psu, and salinity of 15 psu decreased seedling establishment rate to 37%, which partly explained why few seedlings can be found in the mangrove reserve which has soil salinity slightly higher than 15 psu. The adverse saline condition in the field might act as a primary obstacle for natural regeneration of this species. Thus, artificial breeding and culture should be adopted to ensure higher survival rate of E. agallocha seedlings.Then when to replant this species in the field? Results from the present study indicate that seedlings as young as one-month old can hardly tolerant salinity above 15 psu, while for two-year old seedlings, they can adapt to salinity up to 15 psu although failing to surviving 25 psu salinity in the long run, which indicates that E. agallocha increased salinity tolerance over time and two-year old seedlings could be chosen for E. agallocha restoration in sites where soil salinity is up to 15 psu. In addition to salinity, nutritional limitation prevailing in mangrove forests is another challenge for successful reforestation. The current study shows that nutrient addition could not only greatly enhance plant growth, but also alleviate salt-induced damage to plant physiology. Therefore, applying nutrient rationally could be very helpful in promoting survival of E. agallocha seedlings in plantations with relatively high salinity.On the other hand, we should be aware that due to the particularity of their natural habitat, field restoration of mangrove forests is confronted with many other challenges. Duration and frequency of seawater inundation, predation by crabs and gastropods, soil physiochemical properties, inter- and intra-species competition, and anthropogenic disturbance might be equally important in determining whether E. agallocha seedlings would sustainably develop in nature. And researches on these environmental factors as well as various other mangrove species are under way in order for the prosperity of mangrove ecosystems.']"
2016-01-27T00:00:00Z,"An Ecological Paradox: The African Wild Dog (Lycaon Pictus) Is Not Attracted to Water Points When Water Is Scarce in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe","['Our results indicate that availability of surface water influences the habitat preferences of the African wild dog in two opposing ways. Firstly, as expected and in tandem with the ‘resource gradient hypothesis’ there is evidence of attraction between surface water and wild dog distribution during wet years. The mechanism of the attraction could be that wild dog prey (e.g., impala) aggregate around water points and wild dogs follow prey herds for their nutrition. Secondly, in complete disagreement with the ‘resource gradient hypothesis’, there is evidence that wild dogs are not attracted to water points when water points are few. This paradox may be explained by the intraguild predation and kleptoparasitism concept. During prolonged dry period (droughts), some water points dry up, consequently there is more concentration of prey around the remaining water points. This concentration of prey also attracts apex predators (e.g., lion and hyena) which outcompete wild dogs for kills and possibly prey on wild dogs. As such wild dogs are driven away from near the water points to peripheral areas free from competition for kills and danger of predators. We recognize that other variables (e.g., human interference, interaction with other wild dog packs and densities of prey) are likely also to be important in governing wild dog habitat preference. As such, future studies should assess variables including kleptoparasitism and density of other predators and analyze these against wild dog habitat preference. Explicit investigation of the mechanisms linking availability of water and local habitat-wild dog associations will also be an important direction for future research. Nevertheless, our research advances current understanding of the linkages between wet and drought periods to wild dog home ranges, illustrating that water availability does not have a straight forward relationship with canids’ distribution. For example, dwindling water points may indirectly cause wild dogs to range wider, consequently encroaching into human settlements, which may lead to increased conflict with humans and exacerbated stress on this already endangered species.']"
2017-12-15T00:00:00Z,"Nutrients resorption and stoichiometry characteristics of different-aged plantations of Larix kaempferi in the Qinling Mountains, central China","['The present study suggests the nutrient concentrations of C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, and Al in the green and senesced leaves do not change with the plantation age of L. kaempferi in the Qinling Mountains. Most nutrients, except for Fe, in these L. kaempferi are either relatively lower than or close to the physiological concentrations required, thus suggesting a relative limitation of multiple nutrients for L. kaempferi growth. Much higher concentrations of nutrients in the leaves of the 15-yr old plantation could be attributed to the relatively higher content of available nutrients in that plantation’s soil. The low N:P ratio for this species further suggests that the plantation growth of L. kaempferi was mainly limited by N nutrient. Thus, nitrogen fertilizer should be added in a timely way to meet the nutritional needs for L. kaempferi. The nutrient resorption efficiency (RE) of N, P, K and Mg revealed resorption activity, while mineral nutrients Ca and Fe tended to accumulate in senesced leaves. The absence of a single resorption pattern for Ca, Fe or Al, however, in four different aged L. kaempferi plantations indicates that these processes of nutrient resorption are quite complicated, and it is unlikely that one factor governs the nutrient resorption patterns alone. Overall, the nutrient REs of all the measured elements do not change with plantation age, though they were positively related to their respective concentrations in the green leaves of L. kaempferi. Based on the RE of Al, we conjecture that Al detoxification did not occur in L. kaempferi under the present study conditions, even though Al toxicity is common in certain acidic soils. Nevertheless, L. kaempferi leaves that have a higher C:N ratio and lower N concentration will ultimately bring about decrease of rates of leaf litter decomposition. This may have a negative influence on the nutrient turnover and cycling, as well as the soil fertility and primary productivity, of plantation forest ecosystems in the Qinling Mountains. Appropriate human interventions, such as applying nitrogen fertilizer to the present plantations or establishing mixted forest types of coniferous and broad-leaved forest, should be pursued to ensure a balance of ecological and economic benefits as provided by the L. kaempferi plantation forest ecosystem into the future.']"
2015-10-14T00:00:00Z,Dietitians and Nutritionists: Stigma in the Context of Obesity. A Systematic Review,"['So far, there seems to be a lack of sufficient evidence for reasonable approaches to reduce explicit as well as implicit negative attitudes towards obesity and overweight in society. To investigate if and why assumptions about causes of obesity and overweight might arise or change, could be the key to prevent weight-related stigma by dietitians and improve the health care condition for those that are stigmatized due to weight. It might be difficult to change society’s way of thinking about people with overweight or obesity but it could be a first step to start with the occupational group whose responsibility it is to treat them with understanding and respect in order to help them reduce any health risk that is related to their body weight. One way could be to include the issue of weight stigmatization (and its consequences for those affected) as part of the academic syllabus for students being educated in dietetics and nutrition as well as other related working areas. Intervention programs should not only focus on theory and scientific knowledge, but also call attention for discrimination and stereotyping. It might make them more sensible for this issue and therefore lower or efface their negative attitudes towards people with overweight or obesity. In addition to that it might help them prepare their patients in order to deal with weight bias in everyday life situations. Students as well as professionals should be made aware that mistreatment in terms of handling clients or patients as well as misunderstanding in regard of the aetiology of obesity can have negative effects on a physical or mental health level. Although there is mixed evidence whether intervention programs that aim to clarify the aetiology of obesity are helpful in reducing stigma, this component will need to be investigated more thoroughly in the future.Weight stigmatization could negatively affect treatment outcomes or keep the patient from seeking medical advice. Patient-centered care does not only include functional skills and theoretical expertise- it is also about interaction and communication, motivation and patience, and probably most of all compassion and kindness.']"
2014-07-01T00:00:00Z,De Novo Transcriptomes of a Mixotrophic and a Heterotrophic Ciliate from Marine Plankton,"['We used RNAseq to characterize the transcriptomes of two non-model microbial eukaryotes. This approach provided information about genes with known functions as well as multiple potentially novel genes. We experienced the typical challenges of studying non-model organisms and using automatic annotation tools that do not detect the whole spectrum of protist physiological features. Limitations such as unknown levels of genome coverage, high proportion of sequences not similar to those available in databases, and annotations not compatible with protist biology have been common in this kind of study so far. Additional effort was required for sequencing and filtering food transcripts, given that the ciliates under study cannot be cultured independent of their prey.The transcriptomes of Strombidium rassoulzadegani and Strombidinopsis sp. provide baselines for analyzing ciliate metabolism, ecological roles in the planktonic food web and relationships with the environment. Our observations are noteworthy in two ways. First, we analyzed the first transcriptomes from oligotrichs and choreotrichs, which are the most diverse and abundant ciliates in marine plankton. Second, the species we chose practice two contrasting nutritional modes, heterotrophy and mixotrophy, and hence have somewhat different ecological roles. Although the transcriptomes differed in general features such as GC content distribution and had a homology lower than 50%, they provided similar annotations for GO terms and KEGG pathways, which were related mostly to housekeeping activity. As more ciliate reference genomes become available, we expect that more pathways, including novel ones, will be revealed in the data.Transcriptome information alone provided limited insights on genes related to mixotrophy. We did not find transcripts clearly related to the maintenance and functioning of retained chloroplasts in S. rassoulzadegani and we identified very similar antioxidant mechanisms in both mixotrophic and heterotrophic ciliates. The relevance of one enzyme potentially related to ascorbate recycling in the mixotroph as well as the potential differences in regulation and expression levels of all the identified genes require future experimentation in order to understand the implications of antioxidant pathways for physiology and evolution of mixotrophs.']"
2020-02-06T00:00:00Z,Introducing the PLOS special collection of economic cases for NCD prevention and control: A global perspective,"['The studies in this Special Collection provide an array of findings about the economic implications of NCDs and their risk factors across the globe. The modeling exercises point to the high social and economic costs of NCDs in a variety of contexts. The diversity of modeling approaches and outcome measures helps to provide a high level of confidence about the substantial magnitude of NCD economic impacts. Two of the studies examine NCD control programs under specific conditions in Turkey and Kenya and two studies from Bangladesh show that households affected by NCDs or tobacco use tend to allocate resources differently than other households with detrimental effects on well-being. These country studies illustrate the need to account for heterogeneity across households and health systems. Similarly, articles that analyze demand for unhealthy products in LMICs reveal new insights about how tax policy can influence health outcomes. However, there is a persistent challenge in finding adequate data in LMICs to analyze the impacts of NCDs on countries and households. More studies from LMICs focused on analyzing NCD risk factors than on assessing NCD care from the health system perspective, reflecting insufficient information on healthcare utilization in LMICs.Many economic questions remain about the prevention and management of NCDs in LMICs. Evolving economic, demographic and nutritional changes present opportunity for health system strengthening that can address disease but additional policy regulation is needed to reduce the pervasive influence of commercially-driven health risks. Future study areas can emphasize research on guidance about how countries could optimally respond to NCDs, including employing tax-based, regulatory and enforcement tools. Many LMICs now have NCD strategies and include NCD interventions in their plans for expanding population health coverage. To determine optimal approaches for implementing these strategies, more country-level information is needed about the costs and cost-effectiveness of delivering quality care, financing NCD care, and structuring health service resources for NCD care.']"
2017-05-01T00:00:00Z,Barriers to care in patients with diabetes and poor glycemic control—A cross-sectional survey,"['In this population-based survey of individuals with diabetes, we examined factors associated with diabetes care and potential barriers to care across several domains, and compared responses from patients with poor glycemic control to those with fair glycemic control. We found that, in general, people with HbA1c ≥ 10% (86 mmol/mol) were younger but in worse health than those with HbA1c 7–8% (53–64 mmol/mol). We found few differences in access to care between groups but noted that patients with HbA1c ≥ 10% (86 mmol/mol) were more likely to struggle with confidence and appeared to have fewer social supports. Financial barriers were significantly more common in patients with HbA1c ≥ 10% (86 mmol/mol), and these were multifactorial. Given the cross-sectional nature of this survey, it is not possible to comment on causation. However, the data may be used to generate hypotheses regarding targeted strategies to improve diabetes management and outcomes in this population.Disparities in glycemic control in this population are unlikely to be related to lack of access to care. Those with HbA1c ≥ 10% (86 mmol/mol) reported seeing their family physician and other members of the health care team (allied health practitioners and specialists) more often than those with HbA1c 7–8% (53–64 mmol/mol). However, nearly one quarter of patients with HbA1c ≥ 10% (86 mmol/mol) had not seen an allied health care practitioner for diabetes. Given the evidence for improvement in disease control with the use of interdisciplinary teams [14], this represents a potential opportunity to improve care. Further involvement of care teams may also improve perceived coordination of care [14], which was more commonly reported as suboptimal by patients with poor glycemic control.Low motivation to improve self-management skills does not seem to be a common barrier for patients with poor or adequate glycemic control. However, only 18% of individuals with HbA1c ≥ 10% (86 mmol/mol) felt they needed more information, which may reflect low confidence in being able to put information into use. Low levels of social support in this group may be a factor, as lack of social support has been linked to low adherence and low self-efficacy [24, 25]. Similarly, depressive symptoms were more common in the HbA1c ≥ 10% (86 mmol/mol) group, and depression has been associated with low adherence to both lifestyle changes and medications [17, 26, 27]. Treatment strategies that aim to increase patient empowerment, and enhance social support via peer support may be useful in addressing these barriers. Specifically, personalized care planning has been shown to improve self-care and lead to improvements in glycemic control [28].We found that patients with HbA1c ≥ 10% (86 mmol/mol) were more likely to report financial barriers, including not having drug insurance, not getting needed treatments because of cost, and not being able to afford a healthy diet. These results align with studies from other jurisdictions noting an association between cost and glycemic control [17, 29, 30]. Financial barriers increase the risk of non-adherence and are associated with higher utilization of acute care services among chronic disease patients [18, 31]. Our finding may be due to the fact that patients with HbA1c ≥ 10% (86 mmol/mol) were more likely to be under 65 years than those with HbA1c 7–8% (53–64 mmol/mol); financial barriers to obtaining requisite treatments were less common in patients over 65 years, which is the age at which Alberta residents receive universal medication insurance. Access to affordable, healthy food is essential for diabetes self-management and individuals with food insecurity are limited in their ability to prepare appropriate foods and maintain adequate meal spacing [32]. Food insecurity and medication non-adherence often coexist [33, 34]. Increasing access to universal medication insurance and nutritional assistance programs are potential strategies for overcoming financial barriers [34, 35]. Patient navigator programs, in which trained personnel assist patients in accessing available resources, are another potential approach to mitigating financial barriers to care [36, 37].Our study has several strengths, including large sample size, comparison of responses between HbA1c groups, breadth of the survey questions, and excellent response rate. Some limitations are also worth considering. First, our inclusion criteria may have led to underrepresentation of certain ethnic groups due to language restrictions, and limited our ability to reach vulnerable patients who are not regularly accessing care and are less likely to get routine blood work done. Second, patient responses may reflect the specific resources and services available in the region, and potentially limit the generalizability of our findings. Third, we did not capture data for some lifestyle elements (e.g., sleep, description of employment, physical activity and leisure activities) that may influence diabetes self-care. Finally, the cross-sectional nature of the survey prevents us from drawing conclusions regarding causality.In conclusion, we found that patients with poor glycemic control face multiple barriers to care, and though similar barriers were reported by those with HbA1c 7–8% (53–64 mmol/mol), significantly more individuals with poor glycemic control reported financial barriers. Given the heterogeneity of barriers across individuals, tailored strategies to overcome modifiable barriers, in light of the significant financial burden of diabetes, are urgently needed.']"
2016-08-11T00:00:00Z,Brains of Native and Alien Mesocarnivores in Biomonitoring of Toxic Metals in Europe,"['Our research on 94 brains from 9 native and alien species of mesocarnivores is unique and provides important information in the field of ecotoxicological studies. Analysis of the toxic metals in animals from north-western Poland, including protected areas near the Poland-German border, showed that depending on the diet and degree of environmental pollution, carnivore brains accumulated Hg, Pb and Cd in diverse amounts. In Europe, the brains of alien species such as the semiaquatic feral American mink, terrestrial raccoon, raccoon dog and native red fox, can be used in bioindicator research due to their common occurrence and numerous populations with well-known biology.The Warta Mouth National Park is significantly polluted with heavy metals, especially mercury, as a result of historical and present Hg deposition from human activity. The highest and comparable mean brain Hg levels were found in the piscivorous Eurasian otter and alien feral American mink from a floodplain area of the Odra and Warta rivers. This shows that in th/e European Union, Hg-bioindication may used alien feral American mink, numerous in many European countries, instead of the rare and protected European otter. Moreover, our results show that the transfer of Hg from aquatic to terrestrial ecosystems is also mediated by raccoons and raccoon dogs, numerous in this part of Europe.Carrion with hunting ammunition is likely to be an important source of Pb for omnivores and partial scavenger species, the especially raccoon dog. Raccoon dogs living in the heavy metal polluted national park were more exposed to ingested Cd than others. Importantly, based on our own results and literature data, we for the first time suggest background levels of brain Pb and Cd in mesocarnivores of <0.50 and <0.04 mg/kg dry weight, respectively.Suggestions of other researchers that interactions in toxic metal mixtures are basically synergistic in nature and can induce damage in the brain in laboratory mammals (as shown in a few papers) and the correlation found between Pb and Cd concentrations in red fox in this study, are a significant premise to intensify research on wildlife in this area.']"
2015-07-30T00:00:00Z,Trophic Ecology of Atlantic Bluefin Tuna (Thunnusthynnus) Larvae from the Gulf of Mexico and NW Mediterranean Spawning Grounds: A Comparative Stable Isotope Study,"['This comparative trophic study is based on the N and C stable isotopes of BFT larvae from the main GOM and MED BFT spawning grounds. The environmental scenarios in which these larvae develop showed significant differences in temperature, and in nutrient inputs. The GOM spawning area was warmer (around 3–4°C) in comparison to the MED waters. Such temperature differences can have important consequences for the metabolic rates of BFT larvae, and consequently on the larval growth patterns. Although both regions are typically oligotrophic, the GOM waters, in general, were more productive, particularly in terms of mesozooplankton biomass.With regards to the stable isotope signatures, the main difference observed was the low δ15N of the micro- and mesozooplankton in the W-GOM, which resulted inlowδ15N values of BFT larvae in this region. This low trophic positioning of the GOM BFT larvae suggests that they are not part of the traditional food chain from micro- and mesozooplankton to larvae. Unlike the GOM, the MED BFT larvae showed the highest δ15N and TP values, well above the underlying microzooplankton baseline. The depleted δ15N microzooplankton and larval signatures of the W-GOM may be explained by the rather abundant protists responsible for the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen, bringing new N in the lower levels of the food web and thereby, decreasing the amount of δ15N. BFT larvae from the GOM and MED showed opposed ontogenetic diet shifts with growth, with a significant linear increase inδ13C in MED larvae with SL, and a linear decrease in GOM larvae.These results suggest that the food webs and consequent larval ecology among the two spawning sites is distinct. This has implications for the effects of environmental variability and change on larval survival and recruitment among the two stocks, and on the contribution of each stock to overall population recruitment. Continuing research is crucial for understanding larval growth strategies and condition between the two spawning sites, their competition for feeding resources and their exposure to larvae of co-occurring apex predator species, all of which could influence larval survival and recruitment.']"
2014-08-22T00:00:00Z,Evaluation of an Integrated Framework for Biodiversity with a New Metric for Functional Dispersion,"['Our framework is promising for the development of diversity metrics that have desirable properties and explicit units that facilitate ecologically meaningful comparisons among dimensions and among studies. In addition, our framework has two unique attributes that make it a powerful approach for considerations of biodiversity: (1) new metrics that measure different aspects of each dimension of biodiversity or new dimensions of biodiversity can be developed relatively easily and (2) it allows multiple aspects or dimensions of biodiversity to be integrated into a single measure. The flexibility and ease of developing new metrics for this framework is highlighted by the development of an alternative trait-based functional diversity metric, qD(T*), based on total functional distance. Because qD(T) and qD(T*) measure different aspects of trait-based diversity associated with unique functional volumes and functional dispersion, respectively, each may have suitable uses for examining ecological or evolutionary processes responsible for patterns of diversity. Scheiner [6] detailed how to integrate information from multiple dimensions of biodiversity (i.e. abundance, phylogeny and function) into a single estimate. Such an approach can also be used to integrate different aspects of biodiversity within dimensions into a single measure. For example, for the functional dimension, one might wish to independently estimate diversity based on different niche axes (e.g. diet, foraging method, habitat use, masticatory mode, body size). These measures of qD(T*) could then be combined into a single value of functional diversity. Similarly, “importance” diversity could be separately calculated based on number of individuals, biomass and frequency of occurrence (following the traditional use of importance values developed in the vegetation literature [30], [31]), and then integrated into a single metric that simultaneously accounts for each of these ways of being biologically “important”. Such separate and integrated measures may be useful in testing theories about the myriad ecological and evolutionary processes responsible for patterns of biodiversity [8].']"
2018-10-11T00:00:00Z,A benthic bioindicator reveals distinct land and ocean–Based influences in an urbanized coastal embayment,"['Our study has helped address key knowledge gaps linking tracer dispersal patterns and how tracers reflect sources and processes by identifying different biochemical regions in an urbanised coastal environment using a generalist bioindicator, M. plebejus. This species was an effective bioindicator of δ13C, δ15N and some trace elements, such as Pb and Cu. However, discrepancies between some sediment and prawn trace element distribution patterns (e.g. Ni) indicated that local environmental conditions and prawn physiology and diet also had a measurable effect on prawn values. Therefore, juveniles were useful indicators of environmental and chemical conditions at a regional level, but the results of some tracers should be interpreted with caution. The final analysis showed it was possible to distinguish seven of the eight original sample areas within Moreton Bay. These “fingerprints” were able to help distinguish the dominant influences, i.e. urban, catchment and offshore, that affected different sample areas. The majority of tracers showed clear transitions between nearshore and offshore environments. Inshore prawn δ15N, Cu, and Pb values indicated prawns were exposed to higher levels of different land-based pollution. Changes in δ13C, Cd, and As appeared to indicate a transition from terrestrial to marine resources. However, less commonly used tracers, such as REY and Co, were required to distinguish prawns from specific embayments. Greater study of the distribution and biological uptake of less commonly used biochemical tracers (i.e. REY), could help increase our understanding of coastal regions and species. In future, continued monitoring of Moreton Bay using the strategies presented in this study would allow researchers and managers to observe and track environmental changes in relation to local conditions and development. Ultimately, tracerscapes can lead to more accurate assessments of how changes in local processes and catchment inputs may affect coastal estuaries and basins.']"
2018-07-06T00:00:00Z,Tracing anthropogenic inputs in stream foods webs with stable carbon and nitrogen isotope systematics along an agricultural gradient,"['We found agriculturally-derived nitrogen to be strongly related to the δ15N datasets and are comparable to expected organic fertilizer values. However, estimates of fish trophic position through use of δ15N data show occasionally larger deviations in trophic fractionation estimates from those in the literature. This indicates that caution should be exercised when assuming a uniform trophic isotope fractionation value across all locations of study, and that the use of a single, static value is an oversimplification. It may be more likely that 15N fractionation values vary more than previously supposed, and that this variation needs to be taken into account in future studies.As well, our study shows that care must be taken when selecting an assumed trophic baseline upon which to estimate isotope fractionation values, which may vary widely depending on either the organism type or even its sampled location. In the case of this study, neither mussels nor periphyton may be accurate representatives of primary consumers and primary producers, respectively, and algae and small invertebrates are likely to be more appropriate for such studies. The wide range of 15N-signatures in dissolved nitrate also indicates the need to characterize source nitrogen with greater precision through further constraints on isotope data. This may require the δ15N analysis of other nitrogen species, such as ammonium, or the use of δ18O measurements.The 13C data is less diagnostic of agricultural influences and show no consistent trophic isotopic fractionation, suggesting that carbon cycling dynamics are more complex as compared to those of nitrogen. Aquatic carbon cycles are composed of a complicated interplay of biological, geological, and even climatic variables, with any of the above possibly being a dominant factor depending on location. As such, ancillary measurements of both organic and inorganic carbon species should be included for additional clarity, in conjunction with more comprehensive sampling of additional biota. In particular, the δ13C values of aquatic invertebrates, rather than mussel tissue, may serve as a more appropriate trophic baseline in future studies due to their greater importance in fish diets.']"
2019-12-05T00:00:00Z,Behavioural risks in female dogs with minimal lifetime exposure to gonadal hormones,"['This study corroborates results from the related study on behaviour in relation to exposure to gonadal hormones in male dogs, showing a similar increased likelihood of owners reporting fearful and aggressive behaviour in their dogs with decreased exposure to gonadal hormones. Although further exploration of the relationships among peri-pubertal brain development, subsequent learning and eventual behaviour are merited, the current findings suggest that entire female dogs showed a higher likelihood of howling than gonadectomized female dogs, a relationship that was also reported in male dogs. Unlike male dogs, female dogs with longer exposure to gonadal hormones were more likely to be reported as chewers of inappropriate objects.These findings may be helpful to veterinarians, behaviourists and trainers advising dog owners about behavioural management strategies prior to and after spaying.Ultimately the findings echo previously voiced concerns about making blanket recommendations regarding the neutering of dogs, and the potential for long-term unintended harms [93]. In addition to discussing the potential risks and benefits of surgical neutering, veterinarians should discuss other factors including training, diet, lifestyle, environment and preventative care [94].Aggression and fearful behaviour in dogs can emerge through a large variety of processes, and the importance of learning and genetic influences cannot be overstated. It may be alluring for dog owners and breeders to blame gonadectomy for behaviour problems that could be addressed through training and standard behaviour modification procedures, and thus absolve themselves of responsibility and fail to address them. This is a critical issue for dog owners who may not currently be adequately advised by veterinary professionals on the best course of action for their individual dog. The lack of experimental evidence combined with great interest from the dog-owning public may result in the rise of strong beliefs regarding what is best for dogs as a whole that are resistant to change through exposure to new evidence. Strong and rigid beliefs may hamper an individual approach to dog welfare and management']"
2014-06-11T00:00:00Z,"The Functional and Palaeoecological Implications of Tooth Morphology and Wear for the Megaherbivorous Dinosaurs from the Dinosaur Park Formation (Upper Campanian) of Alberta, Canada","['Evidence from tooth morphology and wear combine to support the hypothesis that dietary niche partitioning enabled the coexistence of megaherbivorous dinosaurs from the DPF. Gross tooth wear indicates that ankylosaurs were capable of feeding on tougher plant material than traditionally assumed, but they probably did not consume woody browse in as large quantities as ceratopsids and hadrosaurids. The larger, bladed teeth of nodosaurids suggest that these animals were better adapted to chewing more fibrous plants than ankylosaurids, although the limited microwear evidence available does not support this claim.The complex dental batteries of ceratopsids and hadrosaurids divulge an affinity for particularly resistant plant tissues, but functional differences in the tooth arrangements imply related dietary differences. The strictly shearing ceratopsid dentition was best suited to rending the toughest plants, which likely included abundant leaf material. Microwear evidence further suggests that centrosaurines may have sustained themselves on a more abrasive diet than chasmosaurines, but other interpretations unrelated to diet are also possible. Conversely, the greater crushing component of the hadrosaurid dentition reveals that these animals were likely able to effectively masticate all types of plant parts, including leaves, fruits, seeds, and twigs. Dental microwear supports the contention that Lambeosaurus and Prosaurolophus fed on different plant tissues, but exactly what those were is not clear. These ecological relationships appear to have been stable over the 1.5 Myr duration of the DPF, as revealed by time-constrained analyses of dental microwear patterns. To the extent that the different megaherbivorous dinosaur families from the DPF are present in other Late Cretaceous fossil assemblages from Laramidia [8], [185], we anticipate that our findings are representative of those other assemblages also.Tooth wear evidence also aids in the reconstruction of jaw mechanics. Ankylosaurs appear to have had an effectively propalinal power stroke, which contradicts traditional assumptions, but is otherwise in line with more recent work [66]. Ceratopsids and hadrosaurids were also capable of propaliny, but their power stroke was primarily directed orthopalinally, which accords with the findings of Varriale [42] and Williams et al. [27]. The occurrence of propaliny in ankylosaurs, ceratopsids, and hadrosaurids indicates that this was the ancestral condition for Genasauria.This study is one of a small number of others [177], [186]–[190] to examine non-mammalian microwear in the context of palaeosynecology (sensu Ager [191]), and is the first to consider a Cretaceous community. The dearth of similar work serves to reinforce the basic need for further analyses of dinosaur microwear so that a better understanding of its variation can be gained. Given the fundamental differences between dinosaur and mammal teeth, it will never be possible to infer dinosaur palaeoecology using a strictly mammalian paradigm. For example, while major dietary categories (e.g., browser vs. grazer) of herbivorous mammals are generally best discriminated according to microwear scratch count [46], the more inclusive megaherbivorous dinosaur taxa are best discriminated using pit count. Nevertheless, it may be possible to discern dietary categories among dinosaurs if further effort is focused on elucidating both inter- and intraspecific variation in the microwear of these animals. This, in turn, will necessitate additional research into how tooth shape and replacement patterns influence microwear so that the dietary signal can be isolated. Furthermore, there is a need to learn more about how plants, particularly those that grew alongside the dinosaurs, produce microwear. Current understanding of how microwear forms stems largely from the study of mammals, particularly ungulates, which can be characterized as falling along a browser-grazer continuum [192], [193] or within a trophic triangle [50]. However, dinosaurs did not regularly consume grass, and so effort must be extended to understand the influence of various other plant types (e.g., ferns, cycads, horsetails, ginkgos, conifers) on microwear. Finally, it is necessary to examine microwear patterns in other Late Cretaceous assemblages of the North American Western Interior to determine whether the patterns recovered here are specific to the DPF, or whether they characterize the palaeoecology of Laramidia as a whole. This might be done most profitably with the aid of three-dimensional surface models and automated texture quantification, which minimize interobserver error [194]–[196].']"
2018-09-12T00:00:00Z,"Jaguar and puma captivity and trade among the Maya: Stable isotope data from Copan, Honduras","['The isotope results demonstrate that an integrative approach to investigating and understanding the rich zooarchaeological assemblage at Copan significantly improved interpretive depth and nuance. Stable isotope analyses, in particular, exposed subtle changes in animal diet and mobility that zooarchaeological indicators alone did not detect. Unlike the Teotihuacan case study, there were no pathological indicators of captivity and the age distribution of the assemblage lacked the proportion of young individuals typical of a captive population. Yet the δ13Ccollagen, δ13Ccarbonate, and simple carbon models identified two distinct population clusters: 1) those fed on heavily C4 based diets, corresponding with the felids interred in Altar Q and Motmot deposits, and 2) felids and felid products—including some interred secondarily into the offering caches—with a predominance of C3 signatures indicative of a wild dietary pattern. Their δ18O values further substantiate the postulation that animals and their by-products were an important part of the expansive trade network established across the greater Copan Valley region and beyond, routing their carcasses from sites of capture to be processed into secondary products like pelts and venison and traded, or delivering them alive and intact to centers of state power for ritual usage and display.The implication of this find is clear: Mesoamerican cultures manipulated (kept in captivity and transported across the landscape) a wide variety of animals ranging from those domesticated for food to highly specialized carnivores used for ritual purposes, and this practice was much more extensive than previously demonstrated. Until recently, academic scholarship concerning animal management practices in Mesoamerica had remained relatively undeveloped. This may be a consequence, in part, of the unusual diagnostic challenges arising from the spectacular and disruptive transformation of Mesoamerican ecology and terrain instigated by the European biotic invasion (e.g. livestock) [9,10], especially when contrasted with the relatively insignificant impact that the few Mesoamerican domesticates had on their Spanish adopters. Yet the increasing attention directed toward reconstructing pre-contact Mesoamerican practices for managing deer, rabbits, and other local animal resources has already proven fruitful, particularly when zooarchaeological and isotopic datasets are analyzed in concert [12,18,20,24]. The contribution of Copan data to this growing body of evidence enhances the potential for developing a more comprehensive Classic Mesoamerican resource model; one in which animals and animal products–as essential components of public and domestic rituals–are regularly procured, managed, and circulated.Based on multiple congruent streams of evidence from the Motmot and Altar Q caches, we propose that felid procurement and captivity were practiced throughout the history of the Copan dynasty (A.D. 426–820). Other fauna, such as deer from both ritual and midden contexts, revealed patterns of variation in their zooarcheological and isotopic markers indicative of animals being traded across the Mesoamerican landscape. The deer-crocodilian collar and related evidence furnished by the shaman burial vividly depict elite usage of animal craft products to construct direct links to creatures from mythological realms usually restricted to royal personages [43]. Some of the midden elements found in other residential complexes bear characteristics which suggest they originated somewhere other than the local Copan Valley and should be tested with strontium isotope studies. The Motmot cache also featured animal products associated with other functions, such as food for the afterlife, and secondary products such as the bird elements distributed throughout the cache, which may have been incorporated in the assembly for their brilliant plumage.This Classic period Mesoamerican site readily invites comparison with Teotihuacan. As with its mighty northern counterpart, excavation and analysis at Copan continues to yield a profusion of evidence telling the tale of a society deeply and intimately acquainted with the uses, benefits, and behaviors of the animals inhabiting their settlement as well as from beyond their local domain. Animals fulfilled a myriad of roles and functions at all social strata, and were especially significant components of Copan ritual practice and identity construction.Further research into human-animal interactions at Copan, particularly when conducted using an integrated zooarchaeological and isotopic analysis methodology, provides an extraordinarily rich seam to mine for both broadly applicable field datasets as well as for the more focused archaeological insights uniquely expressed by this universal and fundamental feature common to all Mesoamerican lifeways.']"
2014-10-20T00:00:00Z,Neurobiological Correlates in Forensic Assessment: A Systematic Review,"['The influence genes and deviances in brain development have on the development of violent aggressive behaviour, and in which situation, needs further research before genetic and brain imaging information can be used in forensic assessments or in court. [11], [20], [76] Though most mechanisms are not elucidated, some of the findings may in time be used to estimate risk of recidivism in combination with psychosocial assessment tools. This means better tools for neurologically based assessment might become available as the knowledge develops.As the developmental profile of brain areas and their vulnerabilities are being discovered, key moments to modulate specific environmental factors for persons with a high-risk genetic profile will become possible. [114] For example, some findings can be used to more accurately assess risk of criminal behaviour on an individual basis. However, there is an important ethical difference between using neurobiological assessment tools in the case of suspects and convicted offenders versus in the general population or subgroups, such as children or adolescents. Even in case of the former group, offender rights might be at stake [65].On a more general level, knowledge of nutrition could be used to improve our society or correctional facilities, and help prevent future encounters with forensic facilities. Better guidance during the most difficult years of adolescence and home visits can diminish chances of a harmful overload of the prefrontal cortex and decrease chances of child abuse. And obviously, brain damage should be avoided. Reducing those criminogenic risk factors reduces the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity, both directly and via reduced triggering of gene-environment interactions. [103] In the future, new information from neuroscience, when integrated into the information already available from sociological and psychological assessments, could contribute to the development of better risk assessment tools, treatments and cures for offenders, reducing recidivism as well [16], [21], [63], [66].This review underlines the importance of maintaining a case-by-case differentiated approach to evidence-based forensic assessment that takes into account the individual psychosocial development, and neurobiological and genetic risk factors contributing to violent crime.']"
2014-01-29T00:00:00Z,Juvenile Hormone Biosynthesis Gene Expression in the corpora allata of Honey Bee (Apis mellifera L.) Female Castes,"['We annotated 25 genes of the JH biosynthetic pathway in the honey bee genome and assayed the expression levels of 24, showing that several of these are prominently expressed in CA-CC complexes, when compared to other tissues. Six genes comprising representatives of the mevalonate pathway, as well as of the JH-specific steps were selected for transcript abundance measurements in two contrasting situations of the honey bee life cycle, the fourth larval instar with its caste-specific differences in the JH titer, and in adult workers, which show task-related JH titer differences. This revealed that the transcriptional regulation of a methyl farnesoate epoxidase-encoding gene (mfe) involved in JH biosynthesis in the CA, and of a JH esterase encoding gene (jhe) involved in JH degradation, should be key events for the control of JH levels in the hemolymph. Interestingly, these genes appear to be regulated in a different fashion in the fourth larval instar, when compared to adult workers. Whereas in the fourth larval instar the JH titer was closely correlated with jhe transcript levels, in the adults this was the case for mfe. For adult workers we could furthermore show that mfe expression is also contingent on the nutritional status. This, together with the finding that jhe transcript levels were reduced in workers that had their mfe gene function diminished by RNAi, makes a case for the caste- and stage-specific complexity in the regulation of the hemolymph JH titer in honey bees. Probably this is what is expected of a pleiotropic hormone, and this could also be the center court for the evolvability of its functions in the diversity and plasticity of insect life cycles.The molecular pathway differences underlying JH titer regulation in honey bee caste development versus age-related division of labor may reflect differences in selection pressures on key enzymes during the evolution of sociality. This may not only be reflected in the expansion of the fpps genes in the honey bee, as well in synonymous versus non-synonymous changes in the sequences of other genes involved in JH biosynthesis and metabolism. Both aspects could now be investigated by comparing these genes across bee genomes currently under study. In particular studies intending to investigate the co-option and changing roles of JH in social insects under a phylogenetic hypothesis should consider measuring the transcript levels of mfe and jhe orthologs in addition to the respective JH hemolymph titers.']"
2019-07-18T00:00:00Z,Effect of the black chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa (Michx.) Elliott) juice acquisition method on the content of polyphenols and antioxidant activity,"['The study shows that pressing efficiency depends on the design of the press and the type of pretreatment. The highest pressing efficiency was obtained using the twin gear juice extractor. For juice obtained by pressing whole fruits using the piston press, the application of pretreatment consisting of fruit freezing and thawing had a significant effect on the pressing efficiency. Enzymatic liquefaction of shredded fruits significantly increased the efficiency of pressing using the piston press. The type of press and the kind of preliminary treatment had an effect on the quality traits of the acquired juices. The highest content of soluble solids was obtained for the pressing of fruits not subjected to any pretreatment using the twin gear press. The application of enzymatic treatment or pretreatment consisting of fruit freezing and thawing prior to pressing caused a decrease in the content of soluble solids in the juice. Irrespective of the method of obtaining juice and the applied treatment, differences in the acidity of the extracted juices were small. The study revealed a distinct effect of the method of juice acquisition on TPC and AA. The highest TPC was obtained in juice extracted using the piston press from shredded fruits subjected to enzymatic treatment at 45°C. A higher TPC was also noted in juice from fruits not subjected to any pretreatment and extracted with the twin gear press. The lowest TPC was found in juice from fruits subjected to pretreatment consisting of fruit freezing and thawing prior to pressing. The capacity of black chokeberry juices for free radical quenching oscillated around the level of approximately 90%. It should also be noted that the methods of juice processing had a little effect on the AA of the juices.The study showed that the application of suitable processing methods is necessary for the acquisition of a product with desirable quality traits. To satisfy consumer expectations, one should search for such fruit processing technologies through which the presence of biologically active substances in the products will enhance their nutritive value. Taking into account the documented health-promoting effect of components contained in black chokeberry juice, it can be concluded that after the application of appropriate processing methods, the raw material has potential for use in the production of health-promoting foods.']"
2017-03-31T00:00:00Z,Bacteriophage preparation lytic for Shigella significantly reduces Shigella sonnei contamination in various foods,"['Our studies continue to support the idea that lytic bacteriophages can be used to effectively reduce the levels of various foodborne bacteria in various foods, thus rendering those foods safer for human consumption. Although major foodborne outbreaks of Shigella infections are relatively rare in the United States, Shigella spp. do cause ca. 500,000 cases of illness in the USA annually [3,4,25]. The problem of shigellosis was recently highlighted by an outbreak in Flint, Michigan during September—October 2016, where the population was afraid to use water for handwashing due to the concerns of the water being contaminated with lead [26]. Although the role of contaminated foods in the outbreak has not been firmly established, it is likely that they played at least some—and possibly major—role in spreading the disease. Another, more direct example of foodborne shigellosis outbreak is the 406-person antibiotic resistant S. sonnei outbreak in 2000, which was linked to ready to eat dip [27]. ShigaShield™ and similar phage preparations lytic for Shigella may help reduce the incidence or severity of such outbreaks. Another important area of potential application is the use of phages to improve the safety of foods for the US military and/or travelers; e.g., for treating fresh fruits and vegetables in high risk Shigella locations overseas, where US troops are stationed but where the local sanitation standards and/or quality of water are not optimal, thus creating an increased risk of Shigella contamination.The use of phage preparations for food safety applications has been gradually gaining traction in the United States, where several phage preparations targeting major foodborne pathogens like L. monocytogenes, E. coli O157:H7, and Salmonella are currently on the market. These preparations offer safe and effective intervention modalities for removing their targeted bacteria from various foods, without altering organoleptic qualities of those foods and their normal microflora / nutritional characteristics [16]. After ShigaShield™ becomes commercially available, it will be another addition to that growing family of all natural lytic phage preparations that can serve as an important additional tool for reducing the levels of Shigella in our foods and making them safer to eat.']"
2017-04-17T00:00:00Z,The coexistence of traditional medicine and biomedicine: A study with local health experts in two Brazilian regions,"['In this study we highlight the contrasts and similarities in two different regions of Brazil and we found that access to biomedicine does not necessarily displace traditional medicine, but that these two systems can coexist in a complementary and complex way. However, there are different situations in the coexistence of these two systems. In the Araripe region, we observed a strong maintenance of health practices, reflecting historical, cultural and environmental particularities. The distance to urban centers, the size of the communities and the networks between healers and prayers, and the availability of medicinal plants in natural environments are related to such maintenance. In the maroon communities the changes in the traditional health practices are more present, due to modernization, easy access to urban centers and urban jobs, and changes in the local livelihoods. We are assuming that in the past, maroon and Araripe communities depended more in their self reliance for health care, but one of the limitations of this study is that we do not have the precise scenario of the local health practices before the 1970s. In any case, there is a tendency for the two regions of a decrease in the number of healers, demand for healers, and use of medicinal plants, especially among maroons.In addition to the differences in the two regions, knowledge about medicinal plants and the use of medicines was complementary in the two regions, where medicinal plants are principally used to treat simpler diseases, such as digestive and respiratory disease and general pains, and allopathic medicines are principally used for problems with blood pressure, general pain and endocrine and nutritional diseases.Cultivation and harvesting are still the main way of obtaining plants in both regions, and this favors the maintenance of traditional knowledge. Changes in local livelihoods may change the availability and access to plant resources, when people skip from rural activities to urban ones. However, a local cosmovision abouth health in which prayers, healers and medicinal plant specialists are valued can counterbalance these changes, and may vary depending on the socioeconomic context. This study also found that there was knowledge and appreciation for traditional health practices in both regions. It is important to create strategies to train health professionals to work under these complementary conditions of therapy and to respect the different forms of knowledge in order to seek a higher quality of the healthcare for local communities.']"
2014-02-28T00:00:00Z,Stenotrophomonas maltophilia Virulence and Specific Variations in Trace Elements during Acute Lung Infection: Implications in Cystic Fibrosis,"['Our results demonstrated that ICP-MS analysis represents an useful technique to evaluate changes in host ionomic profile during pulmonary infection, in order to understand the impact infection might have on the host. This approach might be particularly relevant to the management of lung infections in CF patients for the following reasons:\nit might inform future molecular studies on the interaction between microorganisms and the host regarding competition for specific mineral nutrients. Measurement in trace elements might in fact increase the understanding of the pathophysiological processes during pulmonary infection. This is particularly relevant for S. maltophilia, since bacterium-host interactions are not yet fully understood. Specifically, our findings showed that S. maltophilia uses the common strategy of modulating the host ionome, causing significant differences in trace elements balance, probably by direct or indirect mechanisms. The higher impact we observed on cationic homeostasis provoked by the more virulent Sm111 CF strain might be due to its adaption to a compromised environment, i.e. CF lung, and to be associated to an exacerbation of a particular step of pathogenesis.\n\nconsidering the potential association we observed between trace element levels and lung infection/inflammation, combined with their likely higher resistance to protease degradation compared to cytokines, trace elements could be considered as potentially robust markers of lung pathophysiology, thus offering new insight into pulmonary inflammation. Particularly, the observed changes in Mn, Mg, and Se levels in BAL samples seem to be exhaustively predictive for the severity of S. maltophilia lung infection. Therefore, their measurement in sputum might have potential diagnostic and prognostic usefulness.\n\nit might be valuable in defining/designing disease management strategies in CF patients. Control of CF disease includes managing nutritional status, as well as using of therapeutic modulators of CFTR function. Therefore, the observed adverse effect caused by S. maltophilia infection on trace elements status emphasizes the importance of careful monitoring and, if necessary, supplementation of oligoelements during therapy in CF patients concomitantly suffer from infections. This might otherwise jeopardise the outcome of treatment in the patient.\nFurther studies are warranted to confirm that changes in ionomic profile we observed are specifically caused by S. maltophilia, rather than they represent a consequence of infection-induced changes in host metabolism.']"
2015-04-01T00:00:00Z,Direct Healthcare Cost of Obesity in Brazil: An Application of the Cost-of-Illness Method from the Perspective of the Public Health System in 2011,"['The direct cost of obesity in adults to the public health system in Brazil in 2011 was estimated at US$ 269.6 million. This covers the cost of medium- and high-complexity procedures involved in treating obesity and diseases attributable to obesity. These costs attributable to obesity corresponded to 1.86% of all Ministry of Health’s expenditure related to hospital and ambulatory care in Brazil (59.2% of the total was hospital admissions and 40.8% corresponded to ambulatory procedures). The costs attributable to obesity in women were double the costs for men and the cost of morbid obesity in women was five times higher than it was in men. The obesity-attributable costs were highest for ischemic heart disease, followed by breast cancer, congestive heart failure and diabetes.When analyzed by severity, the cost of morbid obesity was found to be proportionally higher than the cost of obesity. Despite its low prevalence in the population (0.81%), morbid obesity now accounts for almost a quarter of the costs attributable to obesity in the public health system, totaled $64.2 million in 2011. Bariatric surgery was the single highest cost, accounting for $17.4 million, or 27.1% of costs attributable to morbid obesity.If the current epidemic were not reversed, the prevalence of obesity in Brazil will increase gradually in the coming years, as well as its costs, having serious implications for the financial sustainability of the public health system. With regard to public policies, it is essential to strengthen the actions already started in Brazil for the prevention and control of obesity, such as: a) increasing the supply and availability of healthy foods, including the reduction of prices of fruit and vegetables; b) the promotion of healthy environments to facilitate adequate food choices and physical activity; c) adoption of effective interventions at all points of the health care network in order to ensure the completeness of obesity care in the public health system; d) food and nutrition education, as the publication of the Food Guide for the Brazilian population and its dissemination; e) restriction of unhealthy food marketing, especially for children.Studies of this nature need to be conducted on a regular basis in Brazil in order to monitor the economic impacts of the obesity epidemic in the coming years.']"
2014-05-05T00:00:00Z,"Phytochemical Composition, Antioxidant Activity and HPLC Fingerprinting Profiles of Three Pyrola Species from Different Regions","['The results from the present study indicated that all tested Pyrola samples significantly differed from each other in their phytochemical profiles and antioxidant property. Through comprehensive analysis and evaluation, P. calliantha was selected as the most valuable species, and the P. calliantha sample from Left banner of Alxa even possessed the strongest antioxidant activity among all the thirteen samples. Futhermore, Emei Mountain was proved to be the most suitable region for producing P. decorata. The results indicated that there were rich variations in Pyrola samples.Different chemical compositions may lead to significant differences in effectiveness as functional foods and nutritional supplements. In order to further evaluate the diversities and quality of Pyrola, HPLC fingerprint analysis coupled with HCA and DA were introduced to establish a simple, rapid and effective method for the accurate identification, classification and quality assessment of Pyrola. Thirteen samples were separated into three groups using HCA at a rescaled distance of 12.5, this separation being consistent with the results of morphological classification. Furthermore, the thirteen samples were separated into six groups at a rescaled distance of 5, which can be identified as the same species of Pyrola from different regions of origin. Two types of discriminant functions were generated using three selected predictor variables and the ratio of discrimination was 100%. In summary, this method can identify different species of Pyrola and the same species from different regions of origin.The present study provides meaningful information for the collection and application of Pyrola in both healthcare and the food industry. Moreover, the results from this study could be used to compare and control the quality of Pyrola and other natural products prepared from them. It is well known that the species of Pyrola are very abundant; in this research we only studied three of them, so a large, systematic study of Pyrola from different sources is required in a future study. Additionally, it is understood that the DPPH scavenging capacity assay, ABTS•+ radical cation scavenging assay and ferric reducing power (FRAP) assay used in the present study may not fully reflect the antioxidative mechanisms of Pyrola in vivo and its health promotion properties in the human body, and further cellular and in vivo studies of the biological activities are required.']"
2013-12-23T00:00:00Z,Relationship between the Relative Limitation and Resorption Efficiency of Nitrogen vs Phosphorus in Woody Plants,"['Using a global dataset for N and P in both green and senesced leaves, we explored patterns and mechanisms in the responses of NRE vs PRE across woody plants with contrasting leaf habits. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation that shows a clear and global-scale negative relationships between the relative nutrient limitation (based on foliar N:P ratio) and the difference in nutrient resorption efficiency of N vs P (indicated by NRE minus PRE) across woody species, growth-forms, and vegetation-types. This relationship supports a relative resorption hypothesis that plants resorb proportionately more of the relatively more limiting nutrient. The relative resorption hypothesis suggests another potential way to determine the critical (optimal) N:P ratio (when NRE ≈ PRE) in a given plant community/vegetation. Moreover, according to the hypothesis, communities with higher/lower foliar N:P (more likely P/N limited) tend to produce litter with disproportionately higher/lower N:P, causing a worsening status of P/N availability; this positive feedback may however be counteracted by several negative-feedback mechanisms.P generally shows higher variability in resorption efficiency, and higher resorption sensitivity to nutrient availability, compared to N, suggesting that the resorption of P seems more important for plant nutrient conservation and N:P stoichiometry. Deciduous plants have lower PRE than NRE while evergreens, conifers, and N-fixers have higher PRE than NRE, consistent with predictions of the relative resorption hypothesis. Evergreens show lower response of (NRE-PRE) to nutrient status, compared to deciduous plants and conifers, which is possibly related to their relatively long growing seasons and thus the relatively stable rate of nutrient re-translocation in EB.This study indicates that foliar N:P ratio, together with (NRE-PRE), can provide a useful tool for the assessment of plant N vs P nutritional status and improve our understandings of the underlying mechanism of nutrient resorption. This should be helpful in predicting how variations in plant nutrient availability induced by global change will influence the nutrient resorption process in different plant groups and alter global nutrient cycling.']"
2008-04-22T00:00:00Z,What Are the Implications for Childhood Pneumonia of Successfully Introducing Hib and Pneumococcal Vaccines in Developing Countries?,"[""It may seem rash even to contemplate the decline of S. pneumoniae, which has evolved as a varied, adaptable, and enduring human parasite. However, the operational success of PCV immunization in America does prompt this very consideration. If the initiative of the GAVI Alliance to introduce effective vaccines against Hib and pneumococcus throughout the developing world succeeds in reducing these diseases significantly, our present approach to the management of pneumonia will abruptly become irrelevant.To prepare against this possibility, we need to re-examine thoroughly the broad clinical problem that is currently labeled “pneumonia”; that is, (i) to define and measure the causes of this collection of respiratory diseases; (ii) to determine the clinical, radiological, and laboratory features, or risk factors, that will differentiate these causes; (iii) to develop and validate appropriate tests to make this differentiation at first and second referral level; (iv) to invest in community health systems and train health workers to recognize these more complex clinical patterns and use these new tests; (v) to estimate the effectiveness of treatments against the various causes through clinical trials which, by virtue of their focus on a subset of all cases of pneumonia, are likely to involve multiple sites; and (vi) to combine all these steps into a rational and appropriate management strategy within developing countries that also integrates attempts to reduce risk factors such as HIV infection, indoor air pollution, and poor nutrition. This represents at least a decade's work, yet the situation we anticipate will arrive in many developing countries before a decade is out. “Early adopter” countries that introduce both vaccines into routine immunization in the next few years will provide useful settings in which to test research ideas.Despite dominating the childhood mortality tables throughout the developing world, severe pneumonia has received little scientific or public health attention for decades. The formation of a Global Action Plan for Pneumonia at WHO and the interest of public health foundations in supporting pneumonia research in developing countries are both welcome reversals of this longstanding neglect [39]. In the context of this renewal of interest, we argue that it is critically important to recognize the rapidity with which the target disease will change across the developing world and to anticipate in the research we propose today the very different clinical and epidemiological spectrum of pneumonia in the future.""]"
2018-06-28T00:00:00Z,"Measuring wealth in rural communities: Lessons from the Sanitation, Hygiene, Infant Nutrition Efficacy (SHINE) trial","['Measuring wealth in a randomized, controlled trial like SHINE is important for a number of reasons, including quantifying inequities, making statistical adjustments for confounding variables and examining effect modification. However, there is no universally agreed-upon approach to such measurement. In this paper, we developed and validated a household wealth index using baseline data for the Sanitation, Hygiene, Infant Nutrition Efficacy Trial conducted in rural Zimbabwe between 2012 and 2017 [11]. In community-randomized trials with a small number of clusters, creating an index has the added benefit that the analyst does not lose as many degrees of freedom as the alternative approach of controlling for multiple factors.Building on the literature and considering the variables important in the local context and to study design (for example excluding variables directly targeted by the intervention), we compared the index to potential alternatives. We find that a “standard” approach (principal components analysis) using a rich, but still relatively parsimonious set of variables is strongly associated with a wide range of indicators of wealth—and is both internally and externally valid. Moreover, an expanded variable set or alternative estimation approach only minimally changes the variation described by the index. From these assessments, we conclude that the SHINE wealth index is adequately robust. We then conducted PCA on all rural households in the 2015 ZDHS to enable a comparison of the distribution of wealth in the two samples using a single common set of weights. In addition to providing evidence of the validity of the index, the paper provides a template for others constructing such indices, including a method for placing smaller regional samples into the broader context of a country when national survey data are available.The results, however, do not imply that the SHINE wealth index is without measurement error. For example, there are possible misclassification errors in the quantile classifications of wealth made using the index, even though the proportion of explained variance exceeds 20% [45]. In analyses where the role of wealth is likely to be highly relevant, analysts may want to consider variations of the index (e.g., employing directly the index value instead of derived quantiles or considering different quantiles since agreement was higher for terciles compared to quintiles) or, on occasion, include directly some of the important underlying characteristics.']"
2018-09-27T00:00:00Z,Oxidative stress and the altered reaction to it in Fabry disease: A possible target for cardiovascular-renal remodeling?,"['In conclusion, this study demonstrates that OxSt occurs in Fabry disease and the reaction to OxSt in terms of antioxidant defenses such as activation of HO-1, is altered in Fabry patients. This dysregulation may play an important role through ROCK signaling induced by OxSt in the cardiovascular-renal remodeling.The extrapolation of the data obtained in circulating mononuclear cells to mechanisms that should take place in myocardial cells could be a limitation of this study. However, it should be noted that circulating blood cells are a valid useful tool in vascular biology to study ‘ex-vivo’ pathophysiological mechanisms of hypertension and remodeling [26]. In addition, it has been increasingly recognized the role of various inflammatory mechanisms such as mononuclear leukocyte infiltration (polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells) and intracellular OxSt for the development of hypertensive target organ damage [26,27]. Furthermore, leukocyte ROCK has been shown to increase the leukocyte infiltration into the vascular wall resulting in the proinflammatory cytokines [28] and an increase in ROCK activity in peripheral leukocytes has been shown in patients with hypertension [29].The findings provided by this study add further information in the pathophysiology of Fabry disease, although, given the small size of patients studied, an unavoidable consequence of the rare nature of Fabry disease, our conclusions should be considered preliminary. In fact, if on one hand this study being, to our knowledge, the first which uses a molecular biology approach to investigate the presence of OxSt in Fabry disease, might justify the limited number of the patients enrolled, on the other hand the results of this study could serve as a useful working hypothesis for further studies with a larger number of patients enrolled as well as to compare Fabry patients treated and not treated with ERT in order to evaluate and more conclusively demonstrate the role of OxSt and OxSt-induced inflammation in the cardiovascular-renal remodeling of Fabry disease. Moreover, a better understanding of the specific molecular signaling response to OxSt in Fabry disease could suggest additional interventions by either pharmacological or nutritional measures aimed at halting the progress of cardiac and cerebrovascular disease, and nephropathy that occur in Fabry patients via the reduction of oxidative stress.']"
2017-11-16T00:00:00Z,Effects of increased levels of atmospheric CO2 and high temperatures on rice growth and quality,"['\nResponses of ecological indices to increased CO2 and temperature\nPhenology, an important ecological feature of rice, indicates whether the plant developed a growth and development pattern that allowed it to adapt to the periodic variation of temperature conditions over a long time [11]. Previous studies showed that an increase in atmospheric CO2 and temperature would accelerate the growth process of plants [13–14], and high levels of CO2 would cause the rice to enter the blooming stage earlier, while high temperature would cause rice to have an earlier heading stage [15]. Based on the test results of a simultaneous increase in CO2 and temperature in the present study (Table 1), these increases shorten the entire growth stage by 26 days, with higher proportions occurring in the elongation and filling stages. This finding indicates that a simultaneous increase of CO2 and temperature would make rice plants have an earlier leafing and blooming stage while the entire growth stage would be shortened. This phenomena may be caused by the acceleration of material migration in these two rice growth stages under the high level of CO2 enrichment and temperature increasing [16, 17], which is similar to findings of previous studies.\nLeaf area is a basic index used to measure the transformation of light energy into chemical energy within plant leaves [17]. Previous studies have shown that leaf area enlarged as the availability of atmospheric CO2 increased, and an increase of CO2 had a certain manurial effect on the growth of rice leaf area [18]. However, leaf area declined as temperature rose, and increased temperature had a certain inhibiting effect on the growth of rice leaf area [15]. The results of the present study showed that with an exception of the seedling stage, the leaf area decreased to a different extent as CO2 and the temperature increased in other growth stages under different treatments (Fig 1A). The reason may be that under the M and H treatments, the temperature rose to 30–40°C, which exceeded the optimum temperature range for rice growth (usually 35°C), causing high temperature stress to inhibit the generation of photosynthates [17], and reduced dry matter accumulation, which offset the manurial effect of increased CO2 on rice leaf area growth.\nThe plant height was proportional to yield and quality within a certain range. For high-yielding rice varieties, the internode length under the ear of rice plus the length of the ear equaled to 45–50% of the plant height [14, 18], with large-size grain, which influenced the appearance and quality of rice. According to the results of previous studies, rice plant height significantly increased after an increase of CO2 and temperature [19]. The present study found similar results with a simultaneous increase of CO2 and temperature (Fig 1B). Probably because the effects of increased CO2 on plant height formative factors were an independent genetic expression, the inner relationship was not prone to be influenced by high temperature.\n\nResponse of rice physiological indices to the increase of CO2 and temperature\nPlants require malondialdehyde (MDA) for plant survival. MDA is an oxygen-containing substance with strong oxidizing capacity that is generated when oxidoreduction was incomplete in aerobic metabolism; a high concentration of oxygen-containing substances may cause strong harm to plant cells [20]. When environmental stress acted on the plant for a long time, a plant would generate membrane lipid peroxidation and accumulate MDA, the product of membrane lipid peroxidation; therefore, more MDA meant the plant was obviously experiencing stress [21]. The results of the present study showed (Fig 2A) that in the seedling, heading and filling stages, levels of MDA were not significantly different in rice leaves, and the MDA level gradually decreased as CO2 and temperature simultaneously rose. This finding indicated that the treatments in the present study did not cause stress to plant leaves. This was mainly because in the present study, after the temperature rose, the range of variation in the maximum temperature in the rice growing stage was 28–34°C (S1 Table), which didn’t cause obvious high temperature stress. In addition, the manurial effect of CO2 may offset some impairment to membrane lipids.\nProline (Pro) is an important organic osmotic substance in the plant. Almost all adverse situations, such as drought, high temperature, low temperature, freezing, malnutrition, disease, air pollution and so on, would cause proline accumulate in the plant [22]. Pro could maintain the protoplasm and environmental osmotic balance, prevent water loss and also serves as a nitrogen reserve substance providing the energy needed to recover growth [23]. To a certain extent, Pro content in the crop reflected the water content in the crop and Pro content increased in case of water shortage [22]. The results of the present study showed (Fig 2B) that proline content significantly increased during the heading stage but under 650 μmol·mol−1 +4°C treatment, the proline content change was mostly lower than that under the CK treatment. This finding indicated that the interaction effect of high CO2 and temperature rise didn’t cause serious stress to plant growth, mainly because high CO2 increased the water use efficiency of the plant, thereby decreasing the Pro content in the rice leaves [24].\nSoluble protein (SP) was the main form of plant nitrogen, as well as the main material used to regulate and control plant metabolism. The change in SP reflected the plant synthetic and metabolic ability, so SP has usually been used as an important index to measure the degree of leaf aging [25]. The results of the present study showed (Fig 2C) that SP content initially decreased and then increased in both the seedling and filling stages, and gradually decreased in heading stage. SP in these three stages did not vary widely, perhaps because the daily average temperature increased faster in the heading stage, caused premature leaf aging, and accelerated the function of leaves synthesizing protein and sending it to the grain, thereby making the SP content in the heading stage decrease rapidly [26].\nSoluble sugar serves as the main form of plant carbon nutrition, which provided energy substances for the plant and played an important role in sustaining the stability of plant protein [27]. Soluble sugar that accumulated in the plant cell participated in osmotic protection, osmotic adjustment, carbon storage, and the removal of reactive oxygen; the variation in SS content is closely related to the photosynthetic ability of rice leaves [17, 28]. Previous studies have shown that a high CO2 concentration would increase the SS content in plant leaves, but there was no agreement on the effect of high temperature on SS. Some studies have been thought to show that high temperature stress would also increase the SS in the plant; SS mainly maintained protein hydrature, reduced the loss of protoplasm water, and was helpful for balancing the osmotic potential between vacuole and cell, thereby decreasing the impairment of lipid membrane and enhancing the plant’s ability to tolerate heat [27]. In the present study, compared to moderate treatment, under 650 μmol·mol−1+4°C treatment, simultaneous increase of CO2 and temperature increased the SS in the rice leaves in heading and filling stages, while in the seedling stage, the SS content decreased as the treatment intensified (Fig 2D). This occurred because a simultaneous increase of CO2 and temperature facilitated photosynthesis in rice leaves, increased the rate of carbohydrate synthesis and conversion, and thereby enhanced the energy source for SS content in the leaves [26, 29].\nSuperoxide dismutase (SOD) serves as a protective enzyme system formed in the cell to defend the impairment of reactive oxygen in the biological evolution process; it could remove potentially dangerous superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide, relieve the impairment to plant cells, and control lipid oxidation. A higher SOD value meant the plant experienced higher stress levels [30]. The results of the present study showed (Fig 2E) that the overall SOD activity significantly increased in the heading stage and was higher than that under CK treatment, while overall SOD activity in both the seedling and filling stages was lower than that under the control treatment. This occurred mostly because the daily average temperature increase in the heading stage was more than that of seedling and filling stages and the high temperature stress reduced the level of SOD activity [24].\n\nResponse of rice quality to increases in CO2 and temperature\nRice quality was mainly reflected by appearance, nutritional and edible qualities of rice; while appearance included the head rice rate and chalky rice rate, nutritional quality included amylose and protein content, and edible quality included gel consistency. These characters directly influenced the overall rice quality and rice sales [31]. The present study showed that an increase of CO2 and temperature caused head rice rate and chalky rice rate initially to decrease and then increase (Fig 3A and 3B), but these were generally lower than that under control treatment (Fig 3C). This finding indicated that high temperature and CO2 impaired the appearance quality of rice and was similar with the results of Xie et al. (2009) [13]. For the nutritional quality, the amylose content had no significant difference under different treatments in the present study; however, protein content under high temperature and CO2 treatment was lower than that under the control treatment (Fig 3D). Gel consistency under high temperature and CO2 treatment gradually increased, which meant the softness of edible quality improved.\nIn conclusion, under increased atmospheric CO2 levels and high temperature, the rice’s phenology shortened, the leaves received certain stress, and the appearance and processing quality slightly worsened.\n']"
2018-04-03T00:00:00Z,Stable hydrogen isotope variability within and among plumage tracts (δ2HF) of a migratory wood warbler,"['We draw several conclusions from the exceptional δ2HF variability observed in the Santeetlah Creek population of black-throated blue warblers. First, accuracy of geographic assignment tests in studies of migratory connectivity hinges on the accuracy of transfer functions to convert δ2Hp into δ2HF [9]. Transfer functions, which implicitly incorporate a variety of abiotic, physiological, and ecological processes are ideally estimated by documenting the hydrogen isotope discrimination factor between feather keratins and local precipitation at each of many known molting areas for each study species. In practice, species-specific transfer functions were traditionally based on the intercept of linear regression of δ2HF on δ2Hp of the pooled sample collected at many locations [6, 9]. More recent models have incorporated data on foraging guild, foraging substrate, nesting substrate, diet, and age class among other variables [20, 35]. Conspicuously absent from the latest iterations of both transfer functions and geographic assignment models is the explicit consideration of population-specific data on within-individual heterogeneity of δ2HF, the observed variation within and between feather tracts of individual birds.Second, the finding of high levels of within-individual variation in δ2HF in black-throated blue warblers emphasizes the necessity of homologous sampling when studies aim to compare δ2HF variation among populations but are limited to a single feather sample per individual. Prebasic molt is a prolonged process that requires up to six weeks to complete in wood warblers. Based on our data, the first and last feathers grown during a single molt cycle on the breeding grounds would in most individuals be classified as originating from molting sites that are separated by several degrees of latitude using the stringency benchmarks commonly employed in δ2HF studies of avian movement [21, 22, 26, 38, 69]. In any event, we recommend the incorporation of within-individual variation of δ2HF in geographic assignment models. In a broader context, the Staffelmauser pattern of molt in wood warblers provides a unique window on the seasonal variation of hydrogen isotopes circulating in blood plasma during the six week period of annual molt on the breeding grounds.']"
2016-09-21T00:00:00Z,Fire Usage and Ancient Hominin Detoxification Genes: Protective Ancestral Variants Dominate While Additional Derived Risk Variants Appear in Modern Humans,"['We studied the evolution of detoxification capacity by determining the genetic variants found in Neanderthal and Denisovan hominins for genes known to have an impact on the sensitivity to reproductive impairment, when exposed to genotoxic combustion and food heating products. We hypothesized that selection occurred in favour of lower risk genotypes in the human lineage after the most recent common ancestor of humans and great apes. We observed a predominance of protective alleles not only in Neanderthal and Denisovan hominins, but also in chimpanzees, showing that these protective variants are mainly ancestral. Therefore, our results turned out to be non-conclusive regarding the time depth of fire usage and our hypothesis did not find any support in our study. However, our results do show that high-risk detoxification gene alleles became more numerous in modern humans, an increase which may have already started in early Upper Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers, suggesting that it preceded the major behavioural and dietary changes of the Neolithic. This finding supports previous studies [79, 80, 99] indicating that increases in population size led to the accumulation of alleles with a negative health effect in human populations worldwide. Apparently, extant human smoke detoxification capacity is to a large degree hitchhiking on detoxification capacities developed in our primate past which had nothing to do with fire. This ancestral primate capacity is possibly directed towards the detoxification of plant polyphenols and indolocarbazole compounds originating from the diet and UV-mediated oxidation of tryptophan in the skin. Hominins must have undergone major dietary changes adapting to different habitats in the millions of years of dietary and niche change since our last common ancestor with chimpanzees. It is surprising that these changes apparently did not lead to major changes in the genes under consideration here, an inference that can be tested more robustly when more high coverage Pleistocene genomes become available. Finally, our study provides unexpected insights into the health risks facing our ancestors as well as extant humans and raises some interesting questions for future research, in particular regarding the distant origins and driving forces of the evolution of detoxification mechanisms, and the role of multiple recent population expansions.']"
2015-03-20T00:00:00Z,"Dentary Morphological Variation in Clevosaurus brasiliensis (Rhynchocephalia, Clevosauridae) from the Upper Triassic of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil","['The morphological differences among the specimens of the sample can be assigned to characteristics that are often influenced by changes during the ontogenetic development, like tooth pattern and wear, dentary growth and secondary bone growth. In C. brasiliensis the lateral wear is stronger in the juvenile specimens, being even absent in some mature specimens. In contrast, the wear in the occlusal surface is stronger in the mature specimens and smooth or absent in the juveniles ones. The dentary in juveniles is slender, bearing more hatchling teeth and the dentary carrier portion of teeth with respect to its length is greater than in mature individuals. In the latter, the dentary is more robust and the hatchling teeth are enclosing by the secondary bone.We believe that there are differences in the way of processing food between adults and juveniles, being juveniles restricted to an insectivorous diet [20,35]. We hold that mature specimens of C. brasiliensis have an omnivorous habit, and it is probable that they have consumed more plant items, compared with to other Clevosaurus. This is supported by the fact that C. brasiliensis has a greater development of the secondary bone, which creates a bigger edentulate portion of the beak-shaped dentary in comparison with other Clevosaurus, and that their teeth do not resemble the mammalian carnassials as in Clevosaurus hudsoni [2,12]. This edentuale portion is similar to the “beak” of Uromastix lizard and it is used for cropping plant [17, 35]. The habit of herbivoy was previously proposed for the rhynchocephalian Sigmala Sigmala, Pelecymala robusta, Sphenotitan as well as the facultative herbivory for Clevosaurus hudsoni, due to the presence of a “beak”[19, 20, 27, 28, 35]. Finally the group that was distinguished for having successflly explored herbivory was the Eilenodontines of America (Late Jurassic to Late Cretaceous) [25, and Apesteguía (unpublished data)].In the case of rhynchocephalians, some important diagnostic features change during the development, such as the proportion of the orbit with respect to the skull size [2], besides the other teatures discussed above. The geometric morphometrics is an effective tool for showing these kinds of biases and for elucidating the shape variation as well as its causes. In the specific case of Clevosaurus brasiliensis, due to the absence of caniniform teeth, which could help to draw reference lines to detect the dentary growth (as in Sphenodon and Cynosphenodon huizachalensis), the geometric morphometry was an alternative tool that helped to understand the dentary growth pattern.']"
2013-12-17T00:00:00Z,"Microstructural, Densitometric and Metabolic Variations in Bones from Rats with Normal or Altered Skeletal States","['We comprehensively assessed the differences across bones affected with different altered skeletal states induced by ovariectomy and vitamin D deficient diets using traditional as well as novel diagnostic modalities. Our findings further justify the inaccuracy of densitometric-based parameters in differentiating metabolic bone diseases. However, although beyond the scope of our study, its usefulness in the diagnosis of metabolic bone diseases should not be disregarded. DXA is still the most widely used method that has among its advantages the ability to obtain measurements at or close to a specific site of interest (commonly lumbar spine and proximal femur) [54,55]. Also, it has been recognized as being relatively less complex and inexpensive when compared to the other methods discussed in the present work [17]. However, DXA measures the average bone mineral content in a two-dimensional projected area with low spatial resolution, thus it cannot differentiate whether the changes occur in the bone microstructure or bone tissue density. Another known drawback of DXA is the possibility of overestimating aBMD values in posteroanterior measurements of the lumbar spine, due to the presence of typical degenerative changes seen in the elderly. Determination of volumetric bone mineral density in any part of the skeletal structure accounts for one of the main contrast points between QCT and DXA. Also, QCT allows for the possibility of assessing cortical and cancellous bone separately [56]. Although QCT has not proven to be superior to anteroposterior spinal DXA measurements, it eliminates artifacts from soft tissue and posterior elements previously mentioned that may overestimate some of the obtained values [57]. On the downside, the precision of QCT-derived BMD measurements depends in part of the repositioning of the patient, as well as in the size and shape of the region of interest. Also, the accuracy of such technique is limited by beam-hardening and partial volume averaging [58]. As osteomalacia is characterized by impaired bone mineralization, the use of densitometric analyses may lead to misinterpretation of the condition as osteoporosis [59]. In contrast, CT imaging in combination with the PET component certainly provides an accurate three-dimensional measurement of the changes in both bone tissue mineral density, microstructure and metabolic activity for cortical and cancellous bone.

2015-06-30T00:00:00Z,The Impact of Climate on the Spread of Rice to North-Eastern China: A New Look at the Data from Shandong Province,"['Climatic changes during the Holocene played an important role in the spread of rice as a crop across China. Our crop niche model shows that the rice at Houli period sites could have been locally grown or exploited by local hunter-gatherers as tropical varieties of O. japonica rice extended its niche into Shandong during the climatic optimum. Relatively minor declines in temperature from the climatic optimum result in tropical O. japonica losing its niche in large parts of Shandong. Areas of southern Shandong that lie on the border for of tropical O. japonica rices niche may have played an important role in placing adaptive pressure on rice to develop a temperate habit. Once developed, temperate varieties of O. japonica facilitated the re-expansion of rice into the province. Cooler areas of the northern peninsula never became fully engaged in rice agriculture. In these cooler areas, the cold tolerant and shorter season crop, foxtail millet appears to have been a primary focus of agricultural production. Ancient farmers in Shandong appear to have adopted rice agriculture in areas and periods of time when it was expedient to do so. Compared to the middle of lower Yangtze, rice does not seem to have played as important a role in the diet. Thanks to their short growing season and ability to tolerate cooler temperatures millets appear to have fulfilled this function.Climatic conditions have long been cited as important reasons for agricultural change and reorganizations in prehistory, however up until recently the lack of formal modeling applied to these questions has meant that it has been difficult to understand how these changes impacted the distribution of crops on a local scale. There is still, however, much work to be done. At present, we lack a good deep time record of temperature variability across the early Holocene in China. Establishing such a record is key to enabling higher resolution and higher fidelity modeling of the spread of crops across East Asia. By allowing us to clearly outline the set of constraints faced by humans in the past, the use of these models will allow us to arrive at better interpretations of the archaeological record.']"
2017-01-19T00:00:00Z,Perinatal Choline Supplementation Reduces Amyloidosis and Increases Choline Acetyltransferase Expression in the Hippocampus of the APPswePS1dE9 Alzheimer's Disease Model Mice,"['These data show that high dietary choline consumption by mouse mothers throughout pregnancy and nursing ameliorates two central pathophysiologic features of their AD model APP.PS1 offspring: accumulation of amyloid plaques and reductions in CHAT protein levels in the hippocampus. The characteristic age-dependent progressive amyloidosis in brain of the APP.PS1 mice [45, 62] was dramatically attenuated by an increased supply of choline during fetal and early postnatal development.Consistent with previous studies, males accumulated Aβ peptides and generated amyloid plaques more slowly than the females [63–65]. Perinatally choline-supplemented males exhibited dramatic resistance to Aβ buildup measured by ELISA and Western blot assays. However, choline-supplemented males and females showed nearly equal reductions in the number and area of Aβ40 and Aβ42 immunoreactive plaques. The latter observations suggest that while the mechanisms that control brain amyloidosis in APP.PS1 mice are sexually dimorphic, the anti-amyloidogenic mechanisms engendered by high choline supply during development operate efficiently in both sexes. Our data showing that perinatal choline supplementation increased the hippocampal levels of β-CTF in both sexes is consistent with this notion. Moreover, the pattern of reduced levels of Aβ peptides together with increased levels of β-CTF in brain of perinatally choline-supplemented animals is reminiscent of what is observed in AD mouse models treated with certain inhibitors of γ-secretase [66–68]–the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of Aβ by hydrolyzing β-CTF. Thus, the mechanism underlying amelioration of amyloidosis in our choline supplemented APP.PS1 mice may be potentially mediated by reduced activity of γ-secretase. Similarly both male and female choline-supplemented APP.PS1 mice were resistant to the 30–40% decline in the hippocampal CHAT protein levels observed in mice reared on the control diet. The vulnerability of the septohippocampal cholinergic neurons to the pathophysiologic process of AD is commonly considered to be mediated by the toxic actions of Aβ peptides [69]. Our observations are consistent with this idea, however, we note that CHAT levels reach their nadir already at 9 months–a time when accumulation of hippocampal Aβ peptides and amyloid plaques in APP.PS1 mice is far from complete. Thus, it is possible that the anticholinergic actions of Aβ are saturated at low levels of the peptide, as seen in our previous studies in cell culture [69], or that they occur in the septum in the milieu of the cholinergic neuron somata, a region generally free of amyloid plaques (data not shown), rather then the hippocampus.AD model mice, including the APP.PS1 mice, reportedly exhibit impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis as they age [70–73]. In this study, both the 9- and 12-month-old APP.PS1 mice had similar expression of DCX–a marker of newly-born, immature neurons [74]–as the WT mice suggesting no marked defects of neurogenesis in these mice. However, consistent with previous studies in rats [16, 59, 60] and Ts65Dn Down’s syndrome (DS) model mice [30], perinatal choline supplementation significantly upregulated dentate gyrus DCX staining and hippocampal DCX levels in both WT and APP.PS1 mice. Thus, high choline supply in early life appears to program the hippocampal neurogenic niche to support robust neurogenesis in adulthood. It remains to be determined if this effect of choline is due to its actions on the early maturation of the neuronal stem/precursor cells in the dentate gyrus per se or due to the modulation of the trophic environment of these cells. While there are no data on the former, the latter possibility is supported by the observations that the levels of multiple growth factors known to stimulate dentate gyrus adult neurogenesis [75] are increased in the hippocampus of perinatally choline-supplemented rats and mice. The list of such choline-responsive factors includes: NGF [15, 76], BDNF [15, 59], VEGF [60], IGF1 [15, 17], and IGF2 [77, 78].Consistent with previous studies [79, 80], including ours [64, 81], the APP.PS1 mice were characterized by hippocampal gliosis as determined by GFAP immunofluorescence and protein level assays. This gliosis was nearly eliminated by perinatal choline supplementation. Given that activation of glial cells in AD and in AD mouse models may be initiated by Aβ peptides [61], it is possible that reduced gliosis in perinatally choline-supplemented APP.PS1 mice is secondary to the amelioration of the amyloidosis seen in these animals. However, in previous studies we observed that prenatal choline supplementation in rats similarly attenuated increases in hippocampal GFAP expression evoked by seizures [16]. Taken together the data indicate that high choline intake during development may have long-term anti-inflammatory actions in brain.The age-associated amyloidosis of AD is the result of the accumulation of Aβ peptides that are produced by proteolytic processing of APP [82]. Similar amyloidosis is found already at a young age in the brains of patients with DS [83], caused by the inheritance of an extra copy of chromosome 21 that harbors the APP gene. Because the murine App and human APP genes encode proteins with somewhat different amino acid sequences, the murine Aβ peptides do not aggregate and thus produce no amyloid. For this reason, mouse models of AD (including the APP.PS1 mice) are engineered to express various forms of the human APP. However, models of DS have been generated (e.g. the Ts65Dn line [84]) by producing animals with an additional copy of a portion of murine chromosome 16 that is syntenic with the DS critical region on the human chromosome 21 [85]. These mice exhibit various morphological, cognitive, behavioral and brain defects that model DS [86]. Interestingly, perinatally choline-supplemented Ts65Dn mice are somewhat protected from attention and memory impairments [25, 28, 30], structural abnormalities in BFCN [25–27], and deficits of hippocampal neurogenesis [30]. These data, together with the current results, raise the possibility that some of the abnormalities seen in brains of the Ts65Dn and APP.PS1 mice may be mediated by common mechanisms related to overexpression of the amyloid precursor protein (App in the Ts65Dn mice and mutant APP in the APP.PS1 mice, respectively) or its proteolytic products [82], including the murine or human Aβ, and not necessarily by the toxic actions of the human Aβ peptides.The overall mechanisms of action of high choline intake during fetal and early postnatal development on adult brain structure and function remain to be determined but are likely related to the metabolism of choline for use in the synthesis of membrane phospholipids (e.g. phosphatidylcholine) and as a precursor of ACh. Moreover, following enzymatic oxidation to betaine, choline functions as a methyl group donor and as such influences DNA and histone methylation–two central epigenomic processes that regulate gene expression [87]. Indeed, we [88, 89], and others [90–93] have shown that perinatal availability of choline dramatically alters brain DNA and histone H3 methylation. In an earlier set of studies we found that prenatal choline intake modulates the methylation patterns of the regulatory DNA elements in the gene encoding IGF2 [88], and that IGF2 mRNA and protein levels are dramatically upregulated by prenatal choline supplementation in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of rats [77, 78]. IGF2 is highly expressed in the choroid plexus and secreted into the CSF [94, 95], and thus may exert global influence on the brain. Previous studies showed that intrahippocampal injections of IGF2 in young rats [96–98] and mice [99, 100] enhances memory function, whereas antagonizing the action of endogenous IGF2 impairs memory [96, 99, 101] indicating the possible role of brain-derived IGF2 in this process. IGF2 upregulates the proliferation of neural stem cells in the dentate gyrus [102], and intrahippocampal injections of IGF2 promote the survival of adult-born neurons in the dentate granule cell layer [99, 100]. In addition, we [78], and others [103] found that IGF2 increases the release of ACh from BFCN. Most importantly, we reported that intracerebroventricular IGF2 infusion ameliorates the amyloidosis and the cholinergic defect in the APP.PS1 mice [81]. In this study, choline supplementation increased IGF2 levels and prevented the reduction in IGF2 protein observed in APP.PS1 mice. Thus, it is possible that many of the actions of high choline intake observed in this study are mediated by IGF2.Our study used a mouse model of AD that causes severe AD-like pathology due to the overexpression of mutant APP and PSEN1 genes that cause hereditary forms of the disease in humans. We found that the severity of the AD-like symptoms in this model can be significantly attenuated by the supplementation of maternal diet with choline during pregnancy and nursing. The vast majority of human AD is sporadic with no known causes and even though its prevalence is alarming, reaching over 30% in individuals over 85 years of age [104], the disease does not appear to be an inevitable result of aging. Some of the factors that prevent or forestall AD have may be genetic; e.g. non-carriers of the APOE ε4 allele [105–108] or individuals who inherited the rare APP A673T allele [109] may be somewhat protected. Our study suggests that vulnerability to AD may be modified by early-life nutrition and further support the notion that adequate intake of choline during pregnancy and nursing in an important public health goal.']"

Each of these niches presents the B. quintana bacteria with unique nutritional and environmental conditions. To begin to understand how B. quintana adapts to each environment, we analyzed global transcription in bacteria grown at temperatures corresponding to the human host (37°C) or the body louse vector (28°C). We observed unique patterns of gene expression at each of these two niche-associated temperatures. These genes included temperature-specific virulence factors with known or predicted roles in secretion, iron binding and transport, and regulation of transcription. For some of the genes that were only described as encoding ‘hypothetical proteins,’ we improved the annotation and identified additional, potential virulence genes whose expression is temperature-regulated. Upstream of some of the genes that were up-regulated at 28°C, we identified a conserved, purine-rich motif that could permit coordinate transcription of temperature-regulated, niche-specific B. quintana genes.Our in vitro whole genome transcriptional profiling microarray data from B. quintana grown on agar at 28°C, were corroborated in vivo using RT-qPCR to document up-regulation of mRNA expression in the body louse for two select B. quintana genes. For this in vivo quantification of B. quintana mRNA, we used a novel model for body louse infection that recapitulates the natural route of infection of body lice with B. quintana. The louse infection model utilizes an artificial membrane-feeding system [20] that enabled us to feed lice on human blood inoculated with B. quintana. Future experiments will utilize whole transcriptome analysis to identify differentially up- and down-regulated B. quintana genes in the body louse, as well as the unique environmental signals to which these genes are responsive. From the perspective of transcriptional regulation, we found that the transition from mammalian host to arthropod vector temperature principally involves deployment of different hemin binding systems and the preparation of export systems to adapt to the new niche. During this work, we have developed important tools (in vitro whole genome B. quintana DNA microarray, and in vivo body louse infection with B. quintana) that provide a new understanding of B. quintana host and vector adaptation and will allow further study of the host-vector relationship.']"

The new standard will upgrade the definition of areas of elevated water iodine (areas with water iodine exceeding 150 µg/L) to the areas with water iodine levels exceeding 100 µg/L. Furthermore, areas in which more than 5% of the local children between eight and 10 years-old exhibit goiter will be regarded as endemic areas. The new standard will be approved and released in the near future.The Surveillance Plan for the Areas with Elevated Water Iodine Levels in China (Trial) has been developed, which determines that the surveillance will sample half of the elevated water iodine counties in Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Henan, and Shaanxi and that surveillance sites will be set up in the villages to survey water iodine levels, children's thyroid sizes, and children's urinary iodine. The plan will be revised and finalised within several years of trial implementation.The survey results have indicated that the supply of non-iodised salt alone cannot ensure that the residents will have adequate iodine nutrition and that water improvement must be adopted as well. The need for water improvement is especially pressing for areas with water iodine levels exceeding 100 µg/L.The goiter rate of the children in Shanxi is slightly higher than other provinces despite no significant differences in the water iodine levels. This observation suggests that other factors may be in play, such as a different type of iodine existing in the water or factors other than iodine.With the increasing water iodine levels, the percentage of pregnant women suffering hypothyroxinemia rises before dropping, and the number of lactating women and women of child-bearing age with sub-clinical hypothyroidism increased eight-fold and four-fold, respectively. Additionally, the number of women who tested positive for TPO Ab increased, and the number of women who tested positive for TG Ab first increased then decreased, and those women positive for both TPO and TG Ab accounted for a high percentage.It is reasonable to define areas with elevated water iodine as those with water iodine levels exceeding than 100 µg/L.""]"
2016-02-16T00:00:00Z,Physiological and Transcriptome Responses to Combinations of Elevated CO2 and Magnesium in Arabidopsis thaliana,"['We proposed a model to show how the combined effect of elevated CO2 and Mg levels regulates the transcriptome profile in Arabidopsis (Fig 9). This model is mainly based on our analysis of gene functions and pathways. In shoots, both low Mg and high Mg induced but elevated CO2 restrained multiple-stress response and cell death, and subsequently immune system process. In addition, CO2 and Mg stresses commonly influenced the primary and secondary metabolism, displaying an inhibitory effect of low Mg but a promoting effect of both high Mg and elevated CO2. Moreover, low Mg specially inhibited photosynthesis including plasma-membrane and chloroplast as well as some related biosynthetic process, whereas high Mg altered leaf shape. On the other hand, low Mg enhanced but high Mg decreased cell wall synthesis and root-hair cell differentiation (e.g. ATXTH17, ATXTH 26, LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT/EXTENSIN 1, EXORDIUM, PRP3, POLYGALACTURONASE INHIBITING PROTEIN 1 and GLYCINE-RICH PROTEIN 5) (Fig 9). Under both low Mg and high Mg conditions, some DEGs were elevated in those involved in immune system functions, in particular, functions related to cell death, and toxin catabolic and metabolic process and defense response. Importantly, elevated CO2 mitigates the impact of low or high Mg on cell wall and root development, which is exactly the interaction nodes of combined treatment of CO2 and Mg. However, the current model still remains incomplete because the integrated output of hormonal cross-talks in response to the combined treatment of CO2 and Mg is complex due to the synergistic, additive or antagonistic effects on signaling pathways.

2017-09-22T00:00:00Z,"Seasonal variations in carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations and C:N:P stoichiometry in different organs of a Larix principis-rupprechtii Mayr. plantation in the Qinling Mountains, China","['In contrast to natural forests, nutrient cycling within plantation forests can depend on artificial management, and the seasonal variations in C, N and P concentrations and their stoichiometric ratios in different growth stages can reflect the physiological requirements of the plants. However, short-term data could limit the ability to predict nutritional limitations in forest ecosystems, so we attempted to elucidate the tendency of the variation in C, N and P concentrations and their stoichiometries via long-term field experiments in a larch plantation. The results of our study suggest that the variation in the C, N and P concentrations and the C:N:P stoichiometric ratios in different plant organs may be caused by the variation in nutrient allocation patterns or physiological demands in different growing seasons, and the evidence indicated that nutrient limitation in forest ecosystems is a complex phenomenon. Thus, the use of short-term data to judge N or P limitation to plant growth is limited.Our study indicated that the C,N and P concentrations and the C:N and C:P ratios in different plant organs were strongly affected by sampling time and plant age (stand age), and should be considered when compiling datasets across large spatial scales. To address the variation caused by differences in plant development and plant age, we suggest that additional information about these factors should become part of ecological plant stoichiometry. The C, N and P concentrations and the C:N, C:P and N:P ratios in different plant organs are significantly influenced by plant age (stand age), which may be used as a new methodology to understand plant growth and the formation of plant communities.Our study indicated that the leaf N:P ratios varied with growing season and stand age. During certain periods of the growing season, the tissue N:P ratio significantly increased with stand age, and the leaf N:P ratios may continue to increase with increasing stand age and to values higher than 14. This topic is being investigated in a new ongoing project, and further studies are under consideration. Collectively, our results should be applicable to sustainable of larch plantation management and inform the application of optimal N fertilization to stands of all ages in the early growing season in our study region. Further investigations of the relationship between the stoichiometric ratios in plants and the growing season or stand age should be conducted to provide insights into the conservation and management of plantation forests.']"
2016-11-10T00:00:00Z,A Data Driven Network Approach to Rank Countries Production Diversity and Food Specialization,"['In this work we have exploited country-food production data to identify subsets of countries which produce similar commodities or subsets of commodities shared by a given country allowing for visualization of correlations in large networks. We have also applied a non-linear iterative map to rank food specialization and country fitness. Our results highlight how the bipartite country-food production network is nested, reflecting that, on average, countries with high fitness producing highly specialized food commodities also produce low specialization goods, while nations with low fitness producing a small basket of food products, typically produce low specialization food commodities. These results are similar to what was found by Tacchella and collaborators for economic products [9].We envision that the quantitative methods presented here will provide new approaches to fundamental analyses alimented by the available data of country-food security. In fact, there is increasing evidence that a comprehensive analysis of food security and sustainability, food trade must be taken in account, in order to evaluate which countries are dependent on food imports [5, 31, 32], and to estimate the impact of the intensification of the land grabbing [33]. The narrowing of diversity in crop and animal species contributing to the world’s food supplies is considered a potential threat to food security [34, 35] and should be readily identified in application of the framework presented above. For example we find that during the period 1992-2011 Ireland and New Zealand decreased their food production diversity, producing 16 and 22 different food commodities in 2011 instead of 21 and 29 in 1991, respectively resulting in a corresponding ≈ 25% decrease in fitness. We stress that this analysis can be easily applied to study production and trade networks weighted with respect to different nutritional indicators (proteins, fat, calories). As such future work can explore import and export data, food specialization with regards to secondary commodities (e.g. chocolates, breads, cheese) in order to better understand how food trade impacts each country’s fitness and specialization. There is also the ability to investigate the relation between food specialization, food price and price volatility as, combined with the presented analysis on import MSF sub-trees, it may help to develop a framework in which to detect early warning signs of local food crises.']"
2018-12-17T00:00:00Z,Stable isotope signatures and nutritional sources of some dominant species from the PACManus hydrothermal area and the Desmos caldera,"['Our study encompassed several dominant species collected from each of three sites. Although local conditions were different at each site, nutritional relationships and trophic structures were similar for the same species across locations. However, for the two species collected in more than one site (R. vandoverae and M. lauensis), there were significant differences in the isotopic signatures between sites. First, chemosynthetic bacteria were the major primary source of carbon in this ecosystem. Second, the dominant species, including shrimps, galatheids, mussels and gastropods, at these hydrothermal vents were not apparently selective in their food choices, which may be due to the limited range of food sources. As primary consumers, mussels mainly obtained energy from symbiotic bacteria that used RuBisCO form I for the CBB cycle. Mussels also obtained some energy by filter-feeding, but in considerably lower amounts. Symbiotic polychaetes consumed mussels and symbiotic bacteria as prey. Like mussels, gastropods relied mainly on symbiotic bacteria for energy with some supplementary consumption of detritus. Tube worms obtained energy from symbiotic bacteria, but their bacterial species were different from those of the mussels. Finally, crustaceans were found to be omnivorous on chemosynthetic bacteria, detritus, or even animals.Since most of the trophic structure relied on chemosynthetic bacteria and the bacteria relied on reduced compounds from the vent emissions, any disruption of vent emission by mining activities could have major consequences on the trophic structure and finally on vent ecosystem functioning. Moreover, our study suggested that there might be food relationship between animals, i.e., mussels and commensal scale worms. In addition, other members of the vent community must be considered in order to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the vent trophic network. Therefore, to evaluate the potential impacts of deep sea mining, it is necessary to study not only the direct destruction of the organisms attached to the mineral rocks but also the cascade effects on the food web of the whole ecosystem. Furthermore, the dense communities attached to rocks formed several microenvironments and presented high biodiversity. Although the relationship of interdependence among organisms in the microenvironment is not clear, there was no doubt that mining had effects on these microenvironments. Before exploiting deep-sea resources, further systematic investigations concerning the protection of deep-sea ecosystems are deeded.']"
2018-10-15T00:00:00Z,Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc.) flour: A functional ingredient to favour the use of an unexploited sustainable protein source,"['All pre-treatment methods improved dehulling and milling efficiency of BG varieties cementing applicability in flour production. The decisive factor in selecting the preferred method for a specific food application has to focus on the sensorial, functional and nutritional properties of the flour. Colour was affected by roasting, such that roasted flour had a darker colour. Nutritionally, bambara groundnut flour compares with other legumes such as cowpea and chickpea. Varietal differences in chemical properties were minor, except for protein content and ash content, which were much higher in the red variety, making it considerably more nutritious. Consequently, pre-treatment is expected to have more effect on the functional properties of the red variety.Differences in thermal properties due to varietal differences and pre-treatment methods were observed. The flours from the red variety had higher gelatinization temperatures as compared to the black-eye variety, whilst roasting caused a higher onset gelatinization temperature. Starch granule alterations are credited in the increase in gelatinization temperatures. Black-eye flours had lower LGC values than the red variety flours, which can be attributed to the higher starch content in the former.Concerning food applications, the low emulsification and low foaming properties reported, suggests that BG flour is not suitable for food products that require a high percentage of porosity. Therefore, the solution to this will be blending with wheat to improve the properties. The high WAC of dry-roasted flour and combined soaked and roasted flour indicates usefulness of flour especially in food formulations involving dough due to its ability to absorb water and swell for improved consistency in food.In conclusion, based on functional properties, both varieties are recommended for flour processing. No single processing method is optimal, but is determined by the intended application. Based on functional properties, the soaked and combined soaked and roasted flours are recommended for further research in product development and consumer acceptance of locally consumed food products such as porridge, soups, bread, cakes and fritters as illustrated in Fig 6. Nutrient enhancement of staple foods such as maize by blending with flour is also suggested as a way of increasing diversity while at the same time alleviating malnutrition problems faced by marginalised communities.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0205776.g006\nFig 6\n\nPotential applications of bambara groundnut flour in food products.\n\n\n']"
2019-07-11T00:00:00Z,ER-Ca2+ sensor STIM regulates neuropeptides required for development under nutrient restriction in Drosophila,"['This study employed an in vivo approach coupled to a functional outcome, in order to broaden our understanding of how STIM regulates neuropeptides. A role for dSTIM-mediated SOCE in Drosophila neuroendocrine cells for survival on NR was previously established [22]. The previous study offered the opportunity to identify SOCE-regulated peptides, produced in these neuroendocrine cells, that could be investigated in a physiologically relevant context.In Drosophila, both Crz and sNPF have previously been attributed roles in many different behaviours. Crz has roles in adult metabolism and stress responses [43,47–49], sperm transfer and copulation [50], and regulation of ethanol sedation [51,52]. While, sNPF has been implicated in various processes including insulin regulation [28,48] circadian behaviour [53], sleeping [54,55] and feeding [28]. Thus, the identification of Crz and sNPF in coping with nutritional stress is perhaps not surprising, but a role for them in coordinating the larval to pupal transition under NR is novel.A role for Crz in conveying nutritional status information was originally proposed by Jan Veenstra [56], which this study now supports. In larvae, Crz+ DLPs are known to play a role in sugar sensing [57] and in adults, they express the fructose receptor Gr43a [58]. Additionally, they express receptors for neuropeptides DH31 [59], DH44 [59] and AstA [56], which are made in the gut as well as larval CNS. Together, these observations and our study are strongly indicative of a role for Crz+ DLPs in directly or indirectly sensing nutrients, with a functional role in larval survival and development in nutrient restricted conditions.Several neuropeptides and their associated signalling systems are evolutionarily conserved [11,12]. The similarities between Crz and GnRH (gonadotrophin-releasing hormone), and sNPF and PrRP (Prolactin-releasing peptide), at the structural [11], developmental [60] and receptor level therefore, is intriguing. Structural similarity of course does not imply functional conservation, but notably, like sNPF, PrRP has roles in stress response and appetite regulation [61]. This leads to the conjecture that GnRH and PrRP might play a role in mammalian development during nutrient restriction.dSTIM regulates Crz and sNPF at the levels of peptide release and likely, peptide synthesis upon NR. We speculate that neuroendocrine cells can use these functions of STIM, to fine tune the amount and timing of peptide release, especially under chronic stimulation (such as 24hrs NR), which requires peptide release over a longer timeframe. Temporal regulation of peptide release by dSTIM may also be important in neuroendocrine cells that co-express peptides with multifunctional roles, as is the case for Crz and sNPF. It is conceivable that such different functional outcomes may require distinct bouts of NP release, varying from fast quantile release to slow secretion [62]. As elevation in cytosolic Ca2+ drives NP vesicle release, neurons utilise various combinations of Ca2+ influx mechanisms to tune NP release. For example, in Drosophila neuromuscular junction, octopamine elicits NP release by a combination of cAMP signalling and ER-store Ca2+, and the release is independent of activity-dependent Ca2+ influx [63]. In the mammalian dorsal root ganglion, VGCC activation causes a fast and complete release of NP vesicles, while activation of TRPV1 causes a pulsed and prolonged release [64]. dSTIM-mediated SOCE adds to the repertoire of mechanisms that can regulate cytosolic Ca2+ levels and therefore, vesicle release. This has already been shown for Drosophila dopaminergic neurons [17] and this study extends the scope of release to peptides. Notably, dSTIM regulates exocytosis via Ral in neuroendocrine cells, like in dopaminergic neurons.In Drosophila larval Crz+ DLPs, dSTIM appears to have a role in both fed, as well as NR conditions. On normal food, not only do Crz+ DLPs exhibit small but significant levels of neuronal activity (Fig 2D) but also, loss of dSTIM in these neurons reduced Crz signalling (Fig 3I). Thus, dSTIM regulates Ca2+ dynamics and therefore, neuroendocrine activity, under basal as well as stimulated conditions. This is consistent with observations that basal SOCE contributes to spinogenesis, ER-Ca2+ dynamics as well as transcription [65]. However, in our case, this regulation appears to have functional significance only in NR conditions as pupariation of larvae, with reduced levels of dSTIM in Crz+ neurons, is not affected on normal food (Fig 1B). In a broader context, STIM is a critical regulator of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis as well as SOCE, and a role for it in the hypothalamus has been poorly explored. Because STIM is highly conserved across the metazoan phyla, our study predicts a role for STIM and STIM-mediated SOCE in peptidergic neurons of the hypothalamus. There is growing evidence that SOCE is dysregulated in neurodegenerative diseases [66]. In neurons derived from mouse models of familial Alzheimer’s’ disease [67] and early onset Parkinson’s [65], reduced SOCE has been reported. How genetic mutations responsible for these diseases manifest in neuroendocrine cells is unclear. If they were to also reduce SOCE in peptidergic neurons, it’s possible that physiological and behavioural symptoms associated with these diseases, may in part stem from compromised SOCE-mediated NP synthesis and release.']"
2017-02-07T00:00:00Z,Explaining changes in child health inequality in the run up to the 2015 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs): The case of Zambia,"['Childhood ill-health has serious consequences. Apart from increasing under-5 mortality rates, it negatively affects cognitive abilities, education attainment, later life income, and adult health. However, children in low socioeconomic background bear a significantly larger share of childhood ill-health implying that they will continue to shoulder a larger share of these adverse consequences. This raises ethical issues. Why should children from poor backgrounds experience more ill-health when the determinants of ill-health are beyond their control, and to a large extent beyond the control of their parents. How can such inequalities be justified when they are hugely generated by inequality of opportunities to determinants of good health, such as education and health care? Against this backdrop, reducing inequality constitutes one of the most important development goals and is now part of the post 2015 development agenda, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), the successor to the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). To derive lessons for the post 2015 agenda of designing interventions that are effective in improving overall child health and reducing inequality, it is important go beyond asking whether or not inequalities increased by undertaking an in-depth analysis of the forces that drive inequality.We examined the determinants of stunting and fever using the 2007 and 2014 Zambia DHS data to explore the existence of socioeconomic inequalities in childhood ill-health indicators, and whether this inequality changed over the period. Most importantly, we quantified how changes in inequality of determinants and the changes in elasticity of stunting and fever with respect to their determinants could have contributed to the change in inequality between 2007 and 2014.While the prevalence of stunting reduced substantially, inequality increased between 2007 and 2014. In fact, inequalities were worsened by the fact that the prevalence of stunting was reduced in all quartiles, except the poorest. This increase in inequality was largely a result of the increase in the inequality of factors that are associated with stunting. These factors include maternal height and weight, wealth, birth order, breastfeeding duration, facility deliveries and maternal education. Although the responsive of stunting to most of these factors, e.g. facility deliveries, increased in 2014, this benefit mostly accrued to the better off because the factors remained concentrated on the better off. As a consequence, the improved responsiveness of stunting to its determinants also contributed to the increase in inequality.Regarding fever, almost all the increase in the inequality was account for by the increase in the responsiveness of the disease to the factors that determine it. By far the biggest driver of this change was wealth, then maternal education, birth order and breastfeeding duration.The key message in this study is that halting the increase in the inequality in childhood ill-health depends heavily on reducing inequality in the factors that affect childhood ill-health while at the same time improving the impact (elasticity) of these factors using both health and non-health interventions. It is important to note that although improving impact of factors that affect child health is desirable, this in itself can be a source of increase in inequality if the factors whose impact are being improved are unequally concentrated on the better off to begin with.Halting the increase in child health inequality is dependent on reducing inequality in the factors associated with child health. These include wealth, maternal education, appropriate feeding and weaning (related to breastfeeding duration effects), adequate care giving (related to birth order effects) and maternal nutrition (related to maternal height and weight). We believe that a more sustainable way of doing this is to ensure equality of opportunities in access to these factors among children from different socioeconomic backgrounds—who are future parents. This may call for policies that delink the dependence of child health on parental circumstances and the community they live. Specifically, group specific interventions aimed at the most vulnerable may need to be implemented along with population level interventions. For example, under the current social cash transfer scheme in Zambia, policy may aim at providing more cash benefits to the poorest households who have children under the age of five years. Poor households may also have special educational needs. For example, children from poor backgrounds may have challenges learning and concentrating even when given access to school due to persistent hunger. Child school feeding programs may help in improving attendance among poor children and also reducing inequality in learning and concentration.Moreover, despite the fact that all households require appropriate breastfeeding and weaning educational interventions—due to the observed association between duration of breastfeeding and child health—poorer households may require special interventions since they have disproportionately longer breastfeeding durations. In general, the propensity to breastfeed longer may be due to lack of appropriate food or knowledge on how to use existing traditional food stuffs. Thus, policy may focus on introducing and scaling up complementary feeding and nutritional programs among poor households. Additionally, since the community in which a child lives matters for child health, policy may also focus on improving living conditions in disadvantaged communities, e.g. sanitation facilities, water, child care centers, etc. The implementation of such group specific intervention may enhance equality of opportunity and halt the increase in child health inequality.']"
2016-05-04T00:00:00Z,"If Dung Beetles (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) Arose in Association with Dinosaurs, Did They Also Suffer a Mass Co-Extinction at the K-Pg Boundary?","['In the absence of a clear and rich fossil record, divergence dating analyses of invertebrates will remain a complex task. We are no closer to reaching a consensus on the evolutionary history of scarab beetles in particularly scarabaeine dung beetles. Past studies have estimated the mean age of Scarabaeinae at 33.9Ma[86], 56Ma [85], 86.6–100.2Ma [18] and 118.8–131.6Ma [PL methods presented here]. The differences in estimates can be attributed to divergence dating methods (including calibration points, priors and programs), taxon or geographic sampling. We present the first evidence of the mid-Cretaceous origin, and Upper Cretaceous radiation of dung beetles, the timing of which is consistent with major global events including rise of the angiosperms and continental breakup of Gondwana.The complex associations between plants and animals make it difficult to determine if single or multiple factors drove the evolution of contemporary biotas. This study of phytophagous and saprophagous scarabs revealed that angiosperms played a major role in the diversification of scarabs as both a direct and indirect food source. We hypothesise that a change in host diet, to incorporate more nutritious and less fibrous angiosperm foliage, provided a palatable dung source for dung beetle feeding thus creating a new niche for diversification. This indirect influence of angiosperms on dung beetle diversification opens up our understanding of how non-herbivorous insects (approx. 50% of species) evolved following the Cretaceous terrestrial revolution. The confirmation that dung-feeding scarabaeines evolved in the mid-cretaceous and rapidly diversified prior to the availability of a suitable mammalian dung source, provides the first inference of initial origin of any insect group to novel ecological interactions with dinosaurs and radiation due to specialization on a dinosaur resource, i.e. their dung. Our results reveal the complex evolutionary forces shaping these lineages, particularly scarabaeine dung beetles, which have undergone co-radiations with angiosperms and mammals plus potential co-extinction with dinosaurs. The reconstructed history of the Scarabaeidae highlights the complexity of evolutionary diversification and ecological adaptation and provides evidence for an extinction event not captured in the fossil record. As the loss of dung beetle diversity at the K-Pg can be readily associated with the extinction of dinosaurs, this is the first insect mass extinction for which we can confidently infer the cause.']"
2017-06-05T00:00:00Z,A matter of months: High precision migration chronology of a Bronze Age female,"['We present a novel set of investigations, in which high-resolution strontium isotope analyses of different human tissues of a single individual (representing complementary lifeways information) are combined with physical anthropological analyses (including CT scanning and 3D visualizations). When superimposed, they provide the first case study in which a migration timeline can be related to the chronological age of the individual that moved. Our study is based on the human remains of a Bronze Age female known as the Skrydstrup Woman who was discovered in Denmark. Our 14C dating place the Skrydstrup assemblage in the Nordic Early Bronze Age Period III (1300–1100 BC). Although the acidic environment within the oak-coffin, in which the Skrydstrup Woman was burried, unfortunately prevented the preservation of human aDNA, our incremental δ13C and δ15N isotope hair analyses reveal a terrestrial diet with some indications of seasonal variation and the microscopy analyses showed that she had fairly coarse hair. Furthermore, our anthropological analyses reveal that the Skrydstrup Woman was between 17–18 years old when she died, and that she moved from her place of origin -outside present-day territorial Denmark- to the Skrydstrup area between c. 47 to 42 months before she died. Hence, she was between 13 to 14 years old when she migrated to the Skrydstrup area in Denmark. After this displacement, she resided in the area around Skrydstrup for the rest of her life. We therefore hypothesize that this one-time movement of an elite female during her “age of marriageability” suggests that she migrated with the aim of establishing an alliance between chiefdoms, rather than being part of a trade visit. In contrast to previous studies on the Egtved Woman (another Bronze Age female) revealing repeated long-distance travels, the results presented herein on the Skrydstrup Woman point to a mobility pattern characterized by a single long-distance displacement.The detailed investigations of Skrydstrup and the Egtved females indicate that young elite women from the Nordic Early Bronze Age might have had very different reasons for moving from one place to another, thereby adding yet another interesting layer of complexity to our understanding of the social dynamics of European Bronze Age society.']"
2015-06-15T00:00:00Z,Assessment of Radiation and Heavy Metals Risk due to the Dietary Intake of Marine Fishes (Rastrelliger kanagurta) from the Straits of Malacca,"['Owing to their pathway into the daily diet of the local populace, radioactivity and heavy metal concentrations have been assessed in marine life from the Straits of Malacca, west coast of Malaysia. The present investigation shows the radioactivity concentrations of 226Ra, 232Th and 40K in sea water samples in all study sites to be very much lower than that of sea fish samples obtained from the same areas.Present study shows elevated radioactivity concentrations in the fish of the Straits of Malacca compared to that reported in similar studies in seas elsewhere. The results reflect the contribution of additional technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material (TENORM) pollutants, largely expected to be a result of oil and gas waste streams, related to shipping activities, the route being regarded as the second busiest water channel in the world. In regard to intercomparison of results from the study locations, the Bagan Lalang area showed the greatest level of radioactivity; here, the narrowing of the Straits, together with a relatively high level of industrialisation, urbanization and the effluents that result from these factors are expected to lead to increased concentrations of radionuclides in the marine environment, including fish.The annual effective doses received by individuals due to the dietary intake of 226Ra, 232Th and 40K via the consumption of fish, range from 154.6 to 286.4 μSv y–1 with an average of 226.7 μSv y–1, falling below the world average for annual effective dose. Accordingly, the carciogenic risk was found to be well below the acceptable limit of 10−3. Present study indicates radionuclide intake from consumption of Straits of Malacca fish poses insignificant threat to public health.Present study identifies the presence of a wide range of non-essential metals in the selected fish, albeit at relatively low levels compared to studies conducted eleswhere, varying in concentration from region to region and element to element. While again the variation is to be linked with industrial locations and types, the pattern does not agree with that found for NORM nuclides, with levels at Pantai Remis now typically recording the greater levels. Although there may not be internationally agreed safe levels for all of these metals, the overall contamination from the samples would seem to strongly indicate the samples to be well below harmful levels.']"
2017-10-11T00:00:00Z,The first hyaenodont from the late Oligocene Nsungwe Formation of Tanzania: Paleoecological insights into the Paleogene-Neogene carnivore transition,"['The Oligo-Miocene interval was a period of substantial climatic, tectonic, and evolutionary change throughout Afro-Arabia, with faunal evolution taking place against the backdrop of environmental changes driven by the closing of the Tethys Seaway and the fragmentation of the landscape by the East African Rift System. In the early Oligocene, Hyaenodonta was the most diverse carnivorous lineage on the landscape. By the early Miocene, hyaenodonts were restricted to hypercarnivorous niches alongside a broad range of carnivoran ecomorphs. The Nsungwe Formation in the Rukwa Rift Basin offers the only late Oligocene glimpse of terrestrial ecosystems on Africa south of the equator, from a landscape newly affected by these tectonic and climatic changes. Pakakali, a small-bodied, mesocarnivorous teratodontine, reveals that late Oligocene hyaenodonts were not limited to hypercarnivory or durophagy in habitats that were becoming more open and seasonally dry. But based on early Miocene finds throughout eastern Africa, the Pakakali niche appears not to have persisted very long for hyaenodonts. Although the trend may have begun before the arrival of Carnivora, the presence of mesocarnivorous Carnivorans likely helped to constrain niche space available to emerging hyaenodont morphotypes over time. Indeed, hyaenodonts occupied novel morphospace for the clade during the Miocene, with extreme body size variation ranging from the tiny (Isohyaenodon) to the enormous (Megistotherium), yet most assumed apex hypercarnivorous dietary niches excepting Teratodon and Apterodon. Apex carnivores in terrestrial ecosystems are particularly reliant on ecosystem stability, as the energetic requirements for these niches are substantial [36]. As such, hyaenodonts may have been more vulnerable to extinction than the invasive carnivorans, being limited from exploiting more generalized diets by their specialized hypercarnivorous dentition. The ultimate extinction of hyaenodonts in Afro-Arabia was likely not caused by direct competition with better adapted carnivorans, but rather the result of hyaenodonts adapting to specialized niches in response to the arrival of Carnivora, niches that were ultimately unstable and unsustainable on a rapidly changing landscape. Understanding how carnivores respond to invasive species and changing climatic conditions is vital for developing conservation goals for modern carnivores, and the Nsungwe Formation offers important insight into the starting point of a natural, continent-wide experiment in carnivore competition, adaptation, and extinction.']"
2015-02-24T00:00:00Z,One-Seeded Fruits in the Core Caryophyllales: Their Origin and Structural Diversity,"['The one-seeded fruits in the core Caryophyllales are inferred to be an ancestral character state in the ‘Earlier Diverging’ lineages (Rhabdodendraceae, Simmondsiaceae, Asteropeiaceae, Physenaceae) and AAC+CC clade. The origin of the one-seeded fruits is a reversion from multi-seeded fruits in the ‘Globular Inclusion’ clade. The dry and multi-layered pericarp, topographically divided into sclerenchyma as outermost layer(s) and parenchyma below, is an initial state in the core Caryophyllales, with a tendency to reduction in the number of layers in many clades, especially in large families such as Nyctaginaceae and Chenopodiaceae. The wing-like outgrowths of the pericarp that enable anemochory are rare and known only in Sarcobataceae, Seguieriaceae and some representatives of the Chenopodiaceae (subfam. Corispermoideae). Fleshy and coloured fruits evolved several times from dry fruits. The families Rhabdodendraceae, Simmondsiaceae, Physenaceae and Asteropeiaceae are set apart from the other core Caryophyllales in having a thick multilayered fruit wall that is divided into several topographic zones, as well as a distinct seed coat structure. These families also share carpological characters such as massive fruits and a lack of nutritive tissue (perisperm and endosperm) in the ripe seed. The first lineage in the core Caryophyllales with typical “centrospermous” fruit and seed-coat structure is (depending on the topology of the molecular trees) either the American Microteaceae or the Australian Macarthuriaceae. The U-shaped cells with fine-grain crystalliferous content in the pericarp above the inner epidermis are mostly known in the Achatocarpaceae, Amaranthaceae, and Chenopodiaceae (AAC clade).The hard seed-coat testa appears to be typical of the majority of the core Caryophyllales. The bar-thickening of the endotegmen layer can be added as a basic character for many core Caryophyllales. All the members with one-seeded fruits arranged their embryos vertically, and many Chenopodiaceae representatives of different taxonomic position evolved a horizontally oriented embryo as a synapomorphy.Unique, taxonomically important carpological characters justifying family rank have been proposed for Achatocarpaceae (polystarch grains in the seeds) and Sarcobataceae (general pericarp structure), and also for Seguieriaceae and Petiveriaceae (pericarp structure), the latter previously being considered part of Phytolaccaceae. The presence of raphides in the pericarp and seed coats, which is hardly noticeable in the one-layered pericarp, and the seed perisperm that is divided into two parts, are the carpological peculiarities of the Nyctaginaceae. The majority of the small families (Lophiocarpaceae, Microteaceae, Rivinaceae) do not show relevant differences in their pericarp and seed coat structure, although some Rivina species are distinguished by acicular outgrowths of the seed-coat testa.']"
2013-05-07T00:00:00Z,"Measuring Coverage in MNCH: Determining and Interpreting Inequalities in Coverage of Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health Interventions","['In this article, we have provided practical guidance on assessing inequalities in coverage of health and nutrition interventions, with emphasis on survey data from low- and middle-income countries. From our own experience, we make several recommendations about how best to assess inequalities in health intervention coverage. First, we conclude that there is no single best measure of inequality, and recommend that at least one absolute and one relative measure should be presented when describing inequalities at a given point in time, as well as when reporting trends over time. Second, when comparing time points or countries, we emphasize how important it is to calculate measures that take the whole population into account, and advocate the use of the CIX and the SII. In addition, we strongly advise the use of logit-based SII for the measurement of absolute inequalities. Because the presentation of these indices is particularly appropriate for academic audiences, we also recommend calculation of the differences and ratios among extreme quintiles, because these are easy to convey to general audiences. Third, when assessing change in inequalities, we argue that it is essential not only to evaluate both absolute and relative changes, but also to report how they evolve jointly. Finally, in situations where conflicting results are provided by absolute and relative measures, we stress that it is essential that researchers spell out the different interpretations of these measures to public health experts, because these interpretations are affected by value judgments and are likely to affect the approaches taken to reduce inequalities in the coverage of health interventions.\n        Key Points\n        \n            Recent international calls for increased accountability in measuring progress towards the Millennium Development Goals demand analyses of health indicators stratified by socioeconomic position and other equityrelated variables.\n        \n            Socioeconomic position can be ascertained using many different indicators, but the use of a wealth classification based on assets is the best option for national surveys, being feasible and reliable.\n        \n            Intervention coverage can be assessed by individual indicators, but because combined measures are important for the study of time trends and for cross-country comparisons, we advocate the use of the composite coverage index and the co-coverage indicator.\n        \n            Inequality measures that take the whole socioeconomic distribution into account are essential, and at least one absolute (the slope index of inequality) and one relative (the relative concentration index) measure should always be presented.\n        \n            When analyzing inequality trends, absolute and relative inequality must be studied jointly because there is a clear interacting pattern of reduction or increase in inequality that sometimes produces apparently contradictory changes in absolute and relative inequality.\n        \n    ']"
2016-08-17T00:00:00Z,"Animal Management at the Ancient Metropolis of Teotihuacan, Mexico: Stable Isotope Analysis of Leporid (Cottontail and Jackrabbit) Bone Mineral","['Stable isotope data produced in this study inform our understanding of the long-term human-leporid relationships at the pre-Hispanic New World city of Teotihuacan. Carbon isotope data in particular provide strong evidence of Teotihuacan’s growing impact on the local environment through the Classic period. Higher δ13Capatite values of Teotihuacan-era leporids in comparison to a modern reference sample suggest that these animals acquired a significant portion of their diet from C4 and CAM agricultural products, likely resulting from a combination of consuming local C4/CAM plants, the raiding of agricultural fields, and through the practices of human provisioning and management.Based on archaeological evidence for butchering, the high frequency of leporid remains, and the presence of a unique rabbit sculpture, we hypothesized that leporids from the Oztoyahualco complex would display greater evidence C4/CAM plant consumption due to their direct provisioning by humans. The finding that the mean leporid δ13Capatite value from Oztoyahualco was the highest of the sample set, indicating high consumption of plants such as maize, maguey, nopal, and amaranth, is consistent with this hypothesis and provides strong support for the specialized procurement of leporids. Small mammal management within the city could have served as a means to channel surplus C4/CAM agricultural products to provision cottontails and jackrabbits, effectively converting excess carbohydrates into high quality protein and economically valuable secondary products, such as fur, hide, glue, and bones for tools.Although no large-bodied terrestrial herbivores were available for domestication in Mesoamerica, inhabitants of pre-Hispanic Mexico engaged in relationships with many smaller and a more diverse non-domesticated fauna [85, 86], such as cottontails and jackrabbits, but also turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) [87], turtles (Dermatemys mawii) [88], and insects such as cochineal (Dactylopius coccus) and bees (Melipona beecheii) [89, 90]. The chronological sample from Teotihuacan, moreover, suggests that such relationships may have become more intensive through time, perhaps in response to dwindling populations of large mammals such as deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Although human-animal relationships were not as archaeologically visible or as impactful to local environments as human-ungulate relationships in Eurasia, human-animal interactions were nevertheless important components of the emergence and organization of complex societies of ancient North America, supplying sources of high-quality protein and other economically valuable products to support dense urban populations.']"
2016-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Partner Influence in Diet and Exercise Behaviors: Testing Behavior Modeling, Social Control, and Normative Body Size","['Despite the aforementioned limitations, this study offers important insights into potential mechanisms underlying social influence in obesity. Our findings suggest that the social convergence of body weight may operate in part through the observation and adoption of health behaviors that contribute to weight control or obesity. We focus on partner convergence in behavior, which has received considerably less attention than peer or parental effects. These results lend support to weight loss or fitness interventions that target dyads and groups—including couples and families—suggesting that adoption of exercise or diet modifications in one individual may spread to proximate others, creating a social environment characterized by mutual reinforcement of healthy behavior. Research suggests that a person who makes a healthy behavior change has a larger impact on others’ positive health behaviors than one whose behavior is consistently healthy [48], underscoring the value of these kinds of group interventions. This also has implications for workplace weight control programs, with potential for extension to schools and other institutions in which regular social interaction occurs.Additionally, our findings may have implications for public health initiatives. For example, prior research indicates that ideal BMI is largely determined by one’s own current BMI rather than by normative ideal body size [49]. In conjunction with our findings, this suggests that social interaction with people who are not overweight or obese is unlikely to affect one’s own ideal body type [11, 12], let alone behavior, and therefore may not be a viable explanation for the social convergence of obesity. Consequently, public health campaigns that seek to promote medical norms of ideal body size are not likely to be effective. Our results on social control may likewise shed light on the lack of observable relationships between paternalistic public health policies around weight control (e.g., taxation or partial bans on soft drinks; [50]) and population levels of overweight and obesity. Direct social control—whether interpersonal or structural—may not be the most effective mechanism of health behavior change, though additional research is needed to confirm this result. In all, our findings suggest that research which directly compares potential mechanisms of network effects in obesity is critical for saving resources and identifying efficient policy and programmatic initiatives by focusing on mechanisms that produce the largest effects on health outcomes.']"
2016-02-04T00:00:00Z,Early Life Conditions and Physiological Stress following the Transition to Farming in Central/Southeast Europe: Skeletal Growth Impairment and 6000 Years of Gradual Recovery,"['This study examined both overall and regional trends in adult body size, limb proportions, and sexual dimorphism among Central/Southeast European foragers and farmers in the context of existing evidence of diet and health from the same populations. This study documented significant reductions in mean stature and body mass among the earliest Neolithic agriculturalists in Central/Southeast Europe relative to preceding Late Mesolithic Iron Gates hunter-gatherer-fishers. The relatively large body size of Late Mesolithic Iron Gates hunter-gatherer-fishers, particularly at Vlasac, contrasted with the relatively small body size and low crural indices of Neolithic agricultural men and women. These deficits in body size and limb proportions among the earliest farmers were followed by gradual increases in mean values across thousands of years, though these were significant almost exclusively among women and were not documented in the Bronze and Iron Ages of Southeast Europe. Particularly high magnitudes of sexual dimorphism in mean stature and body mass in the Late Mesolithic and Neolithic periods suggested that young women at these times were more likely than young men to experience more severe and/or prolonged developmental stress and poor health. These deficits among women relative to men declined through time alongside significant increases in the body size of agricultural women. The very gradual nature by which body size and limb proportions changed through time among agriculturalists, and the regional differences identified in the Bronze and Iron Ages, suggests that temporal improvements to technology and agricultural efficiency, as well as to factors like infrastructure and sanitation, did not necessarily equate to universal, rapid, or population-wide increases in body size. This may reflect the influence of increasing socioeconomic complexity and urbanization on the unequal distribution of resources among individuals and on disease load, and of major admixture and migration events in the Bronze and Iron Ages. However, by the Early Medieval period, mean body size and crural index among both men and women overall had increased markedly from the introduction of farming in Central/Southeast Europe, significantly so among the women. These results parallel dramatic improvements in average life expectancy already documented across the ~6150 years of agriculture covered by this study, and track alongside existing evidence for improved health and access to dietary resources through time among at least some members of Central/Southeast European farming communities.']"
2019-10-10T00:00:00Z,"Spread of domestic animals across Neolithic western Anatolia: New stable isotope evidence from Uğurlu Höyük, the island of Gökçeada, Turkey","['When zooarchaeological and stable isotope ecology datasets are combined, a more comprehensive and cohesive picture of Neolithic animal management on the island of Gökçeada and in western Anatolia emerges. The results of zooarchaeological analysis at Uğurlu Höyük previously published by the authors [9] corroborate the results of stable isotope ecology analysis data presented here. More specifically, osteometric data and mean sheep and goat Logarithmic Size Index (LSI) values for the Marmara and western Anatolian Neolithic sites are similar to that of Gökçeada, particularly of the earliest Neolithic or Phase V. If we turn back to our initial considerations of animal management in the earliest Neolithic and stable isotope ecology differences between phases, there is greater variation in values within the earliest Neolithic (Phase V) fauna than subsequent phases, and a significant difference in δ15N values. It appears likely that caprines at least are more similar to coastal ‘populations’ than central Anatolian stock, though specimens from the earliest Neolithic phase are slightly different than later periods, suggesting a founder population from the mainland and later, a local island population. Even without more detailed paleoenvironmental data zooarchaeological and stable isotope evidence independently converge to indicate that the first Neolithic inhabitants of Gökçeada may have selected their animals from the same colonizing stock, a mainland population source, that was dispersing across western Anatolia and into mainland Greece as evidenced by similar LSI values documented at Franchthi Cave (Munro and Stiner 2015), and as compared to fauna in phases IV and III at Uğurlu Höyük.Zooarchaeological and stable isotope ecology data each manifest a different trajectory, however, during the phases IV and III—late Neolithic and early Chalcolithic—at Uğurlu Höyük. Smaller caprine body size and increasingly young male dominated caprine kill-off patterns coupled with a more caprine-dominant species trend at Chalcolithic Uğurlu Höyük hint at a specialized animal husbandry in which sheep and goats were more intensively managed through time. The decreased body size and changes in stable isotope values suggest a selective process focusing on local animal populations on the island. Fauna such as deer and hare are likely endemic, living in a more wooded area of the island, and are not consuming the same diet as domestic sheep, goat, cattle, and pig. Overall, this compliments the case for a nuanced evolution of animal resource use through time during the process of Neolithization in the region.']"

The dysregulation of GJIC occurs through multiple pathways (Fig 7), and the identification of these pathways within tissue types will be useful in the assessment of risks and benefits of toxicants and chemopreventive compounds. Considering that the liver is a major target for environmental toxicants, the use of the rat liver oval cell type is a good in vitro model system to begin an assessment of the underlying mechanisms involved in regulating GJIC. These cells are bipotent in hepatic tissue, capable of differentiation into hepatocytes and biliary duct cells [22], and represent an ideal in vitro model for studying tumor promotion in liver under the paradigm of stem-cell theory of cancer [24,25]. Our results indicate at least four different pathways are regulating GJIC (Fig 7), two of which depend on either PC-PLC or MEK1/2. The recently discovered PC-PLC-dependent mechanism was a robust and prevalent response of epithelial cells to environmental toxicants. Of the 25 compounds tested, 15 of them required PC-PLC in the dysregulation of GJIC, while three of these compounds also required MEK1/2. The function of PC-PLC in tumorigenesis has not been extensively studied, yet, there are reports indicating that PC-PLC plays a very significant role in cancer [18,52]. PC-PLC has also been specifically linked to the regulation of cellular differentiation [53] and apoptosis [54], which are processes strongly associated with tumor promotion. Furthermore, resveratrol effectively prevented the dysregulation of GJIC that worked through either MEK1/2 or PC-PLC indicating the potential to prevent an adverse effect of a toxicant through compounds that can be attained through diet. However, preventive effects by such compounds are apparently not universal considering that not all GJIC-regulatory mechanisms are equally affected by a chemopreventive agent, such as resveratrol (Fig 7). These results, which are relevant to liver tissue, also demonstrate an important conceptual way of integrating extra- intra- and gap junctional inter-cellular communication mechanisms to maintain tissue homeostasis.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0124454.g007\nFig 7\n\nSummary of toxicant-dependent regulatory pathways of GJIC.\nEach of the four pathways are designated as A.

2017-11-28T00:00:00Z,Primary care and health inequality: Difference-in-difference study comparing England and Ontario,"['Unlike Ontario, England made reducing health inequality a high priority for the healthcare system during the mid-to-late 2000s, and re-directed staff time towards scaling up the delivery of effective care for preventing premature mortality in disadvantaged adults. The divergent trends in mortality amenable to healthcare between England and Ontario from 2007 to 2011 suggest that without this sustained policy action in England, absolute inequality gaps would not have fallen and relative gaps would have increased more rapidly. We therefore conclude that equity-oriented primary care reform in England in the mid-to-late 2000s may have helped to reduce socioeconomic inequality in health, or at least in helping to ameliorate growing health inequalities. However, since this was a non-random study we cannot conclude definitively that the observed differential trends between England and Ontario were caused by “equity-oriented” reform rather than other differences between the two jurisdictions. Furthermore, we have not identified the specific causal pathways that led to these differential trends, so cannot tell which components of reform had which effects on mortality.\nFuture research\nFurther research is needed to disentangle the causal mechanisms underpinning the differential mortality trends that we have observed between England and Ontario, to give policy makers and clinicians a clearer idea of which specific elements of primary care strengthening are particularly important for tackling health inequality. In particular, research using longitudinal individual level data is needed to disentangle the inequality impacts on different categories of amenable mortality (disease-specific causes of death), and on inequality trends in the use of different types of primary care treatment, referral, and medical advice. Our analysis of overall mortality is indicative of differences, but does not specify which diseases have seen the greatest changes in mortality. Future research will also need to allow for differential trends by socioeconomic group in risk factors such as body mass index, hypertension and lipid levels, and health behaviours such as smoking, diet, and exercise, which may act both as confounding factors and also as mediating factors which are themselves partly caused by primary care treatment, referral, and advice. Furthermore, our comparative trend analyses should be extended to different countries and repeated with data over a longer and more recent period of time become available to analyse more recent investments and policies related to primary care and inequity.\n']"
2018-11-01T00:00:00Z,Spousal concordance in telomere length: New evidence from older adults in the US,"['TL has been shown to be an important predictor of old age health and potentially linked to mortality. However, the key determinants of TL are largely unknown. On one hand, heritability estimates of TL are often in the range of 70%, suggesting the likelihood of important genetic factors. Related evidence has shown that early childhood conditions are strong predictors of late life TL. These findings could suggest that late life interventions to reduce TL shortening may be ineffective. On the other hand, spousal similarity in TL (of unrelated people) may instead suggest that environmental factors continue to shape TL in middle and older age individuals and point to the possibility of effective interventions during the middle and later stages of the life course. The findings in this study present new evidence of the possible importance of these later life factors. These findings do have several limitations worth considering. First, using a relatively old sample such as the HRS, may induce mortality selection into the sample and accompanying results. This process may create a sample of survivors who have longer TL than the individuals who attrite. Because the sample is of spouses, mortality bias may be compounded further. Results in S1 Table and S2 Table suggest that these effects may be modest because the spousal sample TL is quite similar to the full sample and the associations between age and TL in the sample is also quite modest. A second major limitation is the lack of investigation of specific environmental measures of exposures that might shape TL, especially related to stressful events, shared diet, and shared toxicant exposures. The broad proxy in this paper is the number of marriages (1 vs. more than 1); additional work with richer data will be needed to explore specific exposure that might be responsible for similarity in spousal TL, especially those who have lived together for a long period of time.Using a large set of spouses from a national sample of older individuals in the US, this study shows modest correlations in spousal TL as well as evidence that couples who have been together longer have higher levels of similarity in their TL. Findings also suggest that spousal similarity in TL is lower in couples with less-educated husbands. A possible explanation is a larger discordance in environmental conditions in these couples, especially if the average husband has low-wage employment with higher levels of toxicant, stress, or other negative exposures than might be typical for the average wife in this subsample. Additional research is needed that explores potential determinants of these environmentally induced TL patterns.']"
2018-10-10T00:00:00Z,Optimizing long chain-polyunsaturated fatty acid synthesis in salmonids by balancing dietary inputs,"['Strategies to improve utilization and storage of LC-PUFA in fish may include a balance of dietary n-3 to n-6 ratios, from sustainable sources. We specifically focused on the dietary ALA: LNA ratio and its effect on LC-PUFA accumulation in the muscle tissue, as looking at the total dietary n-3: n-6 is more constrained, as it does not distinguish among members of the same omega family. Abundance of ALA supply does not necessarily improve production of DHA, and while this has been generally observed in single experiments, we found that a one to one ratio of ALA to LNA optimizes DHA storage based on four experiments. Higher ALA to LNA ratios in the diet resulted in greater storage of ALA in the muscle. However, it is worth mentioning that a high n-3 to n-6 ratio (therefore a low n-6 to n-3 ratio) stored in the flesh is still beneficial for human consumption, even if a generous proportion of n-3 is supplied from ALA. A high n-6 to n-3 ratio for human consumers promotes the pathogenesis of many diseases, particularly because an inflammatory state may be activated or exacerbated by a high dietary ratio [40]. The n-6 to n-3 ratio was estimated to be 15 to 20:1 for consumers in Western societies [3], which has been linked with cardiovascular diseases [40] and cognitive decline [41]. This is further concerning if farmed seafood may not be supplying an adequate ratio of n-3 to n-6 [42]. Because consumers depend on seafood as a source of n-3 to balance high dietary n-6, balancing dietary FA inputs for farmed fish could be a beneficial strategy to optimize final muscle tissue levels of the n-3 LC-PUFA.The conclusions based on four previous studies provided new observations toward optimizing dietary FA to improve tissue LC-PUFA profiles in salmonids. Although single experiment studies have evaluated tissue LC-PUFA content based on varying dietary FA profiles, this examination of several studies yields more general conclusions regarding dietary FA optimization. There were clearly species differences; however, there were general patterns observed that yielded new information. These new optimized dietary FA ratios should be confirmed experimentally, specifically to test the dietary ALA: LNA ratio for maximum DHA storage, and to confirm the DHA synthesis rate at ~23% using a different method.']"
2014-02-05T00:00:00Z,Crowdsourcing Novel Childhood Predictors of Adult Obesity,"['This paper was one of the first to present crowdsourcing as a potential screening tool to evaluate whether the general public could suggest early predictors that are associated with obesity development. Findings show that participants were able to discover determinants that have been investigated by professionals. Most importantly, participants were able to highlight less well-documented topics which might need more attention in future research. However, some of the well-documented determinants from prior research were not found to be significantly associated with BMI in this study. These two observations highlight both the potential and the limitations of crowdsourcing. By engaging the general public in behavioral research, the crowdsourcing approach enables non-experts to proactively contribute insight to the research. However, because it is difficult to carefully control the quality of the questions submitted or the demographics of the participants, as would be the case with a more controlled study, this approach is most likely only a complement to, rather than a replacement for, conventional research methods. We suggest that insight generated from the crowdsourcing process can subsequently be used to develop new hypotheses, which could be tested in larger, more controlled longitudinal studies.The potential new predictors discovered in this research were largely related to parenting styles and family environment. It would be worth investigating how parents could be taught to educate their children about food in a supportive manner as this ‘positive’ nutritional attitude might have an impact on their children’s eating habits and BMI later on in life. Looking at the general family lifestyle may provide broader explanations for the findings of this study. Given that engaging in outdoor activities with family, hours of sleep, and dietary patterns also emerged as significant correlates of BMI, healthy lifestyle during childhood in general is likely to be associated to a lower BMI later on. Habits learned and initiated in childhood tend to be continued in adult life, and therefore a stronger focus should be put on families as a supportive environment for establishing healthy habits [54].This study also suggests several avenues for improving the crowdsourcing methodology. During this study, it became clear that the simple linear regression model used was not capturing all of the explainable variance in the BMI data. Future work will look at other ways to autonomously build models that better predict the outcome of interest. Better models will make it possible to give better feedback to participants about which questions impact predicted BMI (or other outcomes of interest). Experience with the crowdsourcing approach suggests that this feedback between the website and participants is an important motivator for participation. In future work we will study other ways to motivate participation, particularly ways to encourage participants to return to the site after their initial participation, or ways to find participants from more varied backgrounds.']"
2014-11-04T00:00:00Z,Nowcasting and Forecasting the Monthly Food Stamps Data in the US Using Online Search Data,"[""We proposed the use of Google data based on internet searches about food stamps as a potential indicator to nowcast and forecast the US monthly number of individuals participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as the Food Stamp program. We compared almost 3000 forecasting models and we found that Google based models definitively improved nowcasting food stamps 2 months ahead, while simple linear models (eventually augmented with unemployment rates or initial claims data) are sufficient for nowcasting 1 month ahead. Moreover, Google based models provided statistically significant superior forecasts in case of forecasting 12 steps and 24 steps ahead. More specifically, linear autoregressive models augmented with Google search data for the terms “food stamps” and “jobs”, the unemployment rate and initial claims were the best models for forecasting purposes. In this regard, the best models had specifications always close to the ARX(4) model found using the structural relationship identification methodology by [29] and [30] in the in-sample analysis, thus showing that this approach is a rather robust method of model selection in case of small samples.Nonlinear models performed poorly, were computationally intensive, and in several cases did not reach numerical convergence, with the exception of additive autoregressive models which provided competitive forecasts in case of long term forecasting. Simple periodic autoregressive models performed quite well for 12-step and 24-step ahead forecasts, while more complex periodic models performed poorly, probably due to the high number of estimated parameters which hindered their forecasting performances. Our results hold also with alternative out-of-sample periods which either include the global financial crisis or start after the (official) end of this recession. Besides, our Google based models passed a falsification test which considered the forecasting performance of an alternative Google index chosen by Google Correlate. Similar results were also found when considering the directional accuracy of the models' forecasts. Finally, the estimates for single US states gave similar results to the case of the whole US, even though we found that Google data are very important in case of highly densely populated US states, while their importance is minor for several states with small population.We remark that although we considered a very large set of models, we had to restrict the potential range of models to keep the forecasting exercise computationally tractable. An avenue of future research would be to consider additional models like fractional cointegration, exponential smoothing methods in state space form and many others.""]"
2019-12-02T00:00:00Z,"Strengthening counseling on barriers to exclusive breastfeeding through use of job aids in Nampula, Mozambique","['In the future, findings from this seminal implementation science study on breastfeeding counseling can be used to integrate high-quality breastfeeding counseling content into maternal and child health and nutrition curricula and supportive supervision materials for community and facility levels that address IYCF. The 2018 WHO Guidelines on Counseling of Women to Improve Breastfeeding Practices recommend counseling occur during at least six breastfeeding contacts, which includes antenatal care, the first two to three days of life, the neonatal period (first week), and early infancy (first three to four months), which can be leveraged in Mozambique to address challenges to EBF at key time points and with appropriate frequency [12]. Furthermore, the development of clear lactation management protocols that help providers understand the causes and key ways to address insufficient breastmilk, physical breast problems (engorgement, sore nipples), positioning, and correct latching would be of use in Mozambique. Evidence indicates that breastfeeding problems tend to originate from poor lactation knowledge and management very early on after birth, so it is important to reach women with effective breastfeeding counseling support in health care facilities and at the community [44]. Our findings also call for addressing the excessive caseloads and limited time that health providers have through task shifting to community health workers, as well as early return to work postpartum which is a key challenge to EBF in Mozambique. Finally, as Mozambique has endorsed the WHO Code for Marketing Breastmilk Substitutes [51,52], the MOH and Ministry of Gender, Child and Social Action should join efforts to ensure the criteria for infant formula distribution to INAS are known by all relevant stakeholders and strictly followed.Short-term and long-term investments to improve breastfeeding counseling services during routine contact points and the implementation and sustainability of large-scale improvements in breastfeeding counseling in Mozambique would benefit from employing the Breastfeeding Gear Model as a framework. The Breastfeeding Gear Model can provide countries, such as Mozambique, with practical guidance to address gaps in breastfeeding counseling and propose policy recommendations to strengthen the breastfeeding environment across a number of domains [53,54]. Specifically, the Breastfeeding Gear Model examines what is needed to scale up EBF counseling through eight gears: advocacy, political will, legislation, funding and resources, training and program delivery, promotion, research and evaluation, and coordination and monitoring. Collectively, harmonization of these components is needed to achieve improvements in the scale-up of breastfeeding-friendly environment and in building country capacity in skilled lactation care, which is essential to improve breastfeeding practices globally [55].']"
2019-08-21T00:00:00Z,"Cranial deformation and genetic diversity in three adolescent male individuals from the Great Migration Period from Osijek, eastern Croatia","['The presented study reports an unusual archaeological feature with human remains belonging to three individuals from eastern Croatia dated to the Migration Period. Based on the archaeological context and a direct radiocarbon date, the feature was dated to the 5th/6th century CE and is likely associated with the Huns or Germanic tribes, a hypothesis supported by historical records. In addition to deriving from the same context, the three disarticulated and commingled skeletons found in the feature exhibit numerous similarities in biological terms: they belong to three adolescent males (between 12 and 16 years old at the time of death), they show similar pathologies suggesting a sustained and severe experience of stress, and finally, at least two individuals had a very similar diet. However, there is one significant morphological difference that distinguishes these individuals: two individuals show two different types of ACD (tabular oblique and circular erect deformations), while the cranium belonging to the third individual does not show any signs of artificial deformation. The results of genetic analyses point to an additional difference that cannot be discerned with the naked eye: these three individuals did not share the same biogeographic ancestry. More precisely, SU 259 (an individual with ACD) shows mainly East Asian ancestry, and is, to our knowledge, the first individual from the Migration Period with a majority of his ancestry originating in East Asia to be found in Europe. On the other hand, SU 750 (another individual with ACD) and SU 261 show West Eurasian ancestries similar to the patterns of population ancestry variation seen in Early Medieval Bavaria [32], though we note that our interpretations are made using low-resolution genomic data and are therefore conservative.Although there are several hypotheses about the meaning of ACD in Pannonian Plain during the Migration Period, including an indication of social status or an indelible fashion statement, the cases from Osijek could suggest a different explanation. Based on the presented data, it seems that different types of ACD (or the lack thereof) might be associated with affiliation with a particular cultural group (at least in the case of Osijek), leading us to consider that populations with different ancestries and potentially different cultures were interacting intimately on the Pannonian Plain during the Great Migration Period. This leads us to ask: is this a random peculiarity or part of a larger-scale pattern of association between ACD type and group membership? We believe that future multi- and inter-disciplinary studies combining archaeology, bioarchaeology, history, stable isotopes analysis, and ancient DNA, conducted on a larger skeletal sample from a wider region will aid us in answering this question.']"
2015-11-24T00:00:00Z,Vaginal Microbiome Characterization of Nellore Cattle Using Metagenomic Analysis,"['The present study aimed to characterize the vaginal microbiota in Nellore, the major beef cattle in Brazil, investigating heifers and cows pregnant or non-pregnant. To date, only one other study has exploited the vaginal microbiome using a culture-independent approach: Swartz and colleagues [14] also found great bacterial diversity, and contrasting results with culture-dependent methods, but depicted many different dominant genera from what is presented in this study. This could be related to the different 16S rRNA target used (V3-V4, while we used V5-V6), cattle breed (crossbred x pure Nellore) or even diet and handling, since we believe this tract is directly influenced by the GIT. These findings only confirm the need to further explore this important microbiome. In this study, metagenomic analysis showed great diversity for bacterial microbiota and low diversity for the archaeal and fungal components. The vaginal tract was dominated by a wide variety of Bacteria, with a tendency to higher abundance of this domain in non-pregnant animals. Investigations at phylum and genus levels did not show a clear variation between heifers and cows nor between pregnant and non-pregnant animals regarding the dominant OTUs, but established a paradigm on the bacterial communities found inside the bovine vaginal tract, which can be divided in at least three different types, based on the major OTUs found and their metabolism. The most abundant bacterial phyla were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, while the dominant genera were distributed along many groups, especially Aeribacillus, Bacteroides, Clostridium and Ruminoccocus. Archaea were present in higher quantities in pregnant animals, having low abundance in the non-pregnant ones. Concerning Archaea, the only phylum encountered was Euryarchaeota, and the major genus. The eukaryotes tend to be present in higher quantities in older animals (cows), and did not vary significantly with hormonal status, although there was a tendency to a decrease in abundance of dominant OTUs in pregnant animals. Ascomycota was the dominant phylum, and Mycosphaerella was the major genus in all four studied groups. The results showed a microbiota whose development is strongly influenced by the proximity of the gastrointestinal tract, without displaying a relevant hormonal influence on the microbial ecology, during either puberty or pregnancy. Although many questions raised by our work requires additional studies, which is natural for a pioneer investigation, a solid overview can be identified based on the findings presented here. Future work should involve other bovine races and different handling, immunity and hormonal status in order to confirm our findings, or establish a new paradigm.']"
2015-09-02T00:00:00Z,"Stable Isotopes and Zooarchaeology at Teotihuacan, Mexico Reveal Earliest Evidence of Wild Carnivore Management in Mesoamerica","['Zooarchaeological and isotopic evidence from Teotihuacan demonstrate the carnivores utilized in state rituals at Teotihuacan were a heterogeneous group: some of the sacrificed individuals were kept in captivity, others were brought in from the wilderness, and some were used to produce ritual paraphernalia. Canid and felid skeletons demonstrate that sacrificial victims were often kept in captivity while faunal products used as ritual paraphernalia originated from a wild population. In contrast, both sacrificed and prepared skeletons of eagles demonstrate some degree of captive management. Compared to the well-established breeding programs recorded at the Aztec capital, the animals found at Teotihuacan probably reflect initial experimentation in manipulating dangerous and specialized carnivores. This process probably involved capturing the animals alive while they were young to be raised within the city confines on small animals, most likely rabbits and hares that ate an exclusively C4 based diet. In some instances, rabbits and hares may have been supplemented by other omnivores, including dogs and possibly even humans.Specimens like the eagle, Element 2246, attest to the hardships in learning to manipulate highly specialized carnivores. Keeping a captive population alive must have been difficult, sometimes resulting in accidental deaths of their captive eagles that were then expediently prepared to keep the body intact; these stuffed cadavers would have participated alongside live eagles as if they were also “sacrificed”. Caring for and manipulating the region’s most dangerous apex predators sometimes required the use of brute force as evidenced by an unnaturally high frequency of healed fractures, violent injuries, bone deformity and disease.The broader implications of these finds are apparent; they not only provide the earliest direct evidence for ritualistic management of carnivores but also demonstrate a fundamental shift in past human-carnivore interactions that was intrinsically tied to the development of one of the most empowered ceremonial landscapes in Mesoamerica. As both the jaguar and Mexican grey wolf are currently on the endangered species lists, the archaeological and isotopic data presented provide a window into understanding human-animal encounters of these endangered species through the long dureé, beginning with the earliest documentation of how these animals were captured and managed. These data also speak to a direct connection between carnivore manipulation and state power. There was an impetus to bring live carnivores into the city as cubs/chicks to be raised within the urban metropolis as sacrificial victims par excellence. It is not a coincidence that such active animal management programs coincided with the development of large monumental structures where animals were embedded into pyramids as key symbols of the Teotihuacan state.']"
2019-05-16T00:00:00Z,Securing the future of research computing in the biosciences,"['The integration of large-scale computing into the scientific method within many more areas of the biosciences requires investment into a broad ecosystem of research computing. We have focused on the exciting biological discoveries that can be made through the widespread uptake of computation to illustrate that undertaking this challenge is necessary and timely and will ultimately transform the biological sciences. Researchers, academics, institutions, learned societies, funders, and enterprise IT professionals need to discuss the scientific and organisational issues to ensure that there are sufficient resources and flexibility to accommodate this influx of novel technology and the people who support it. The closer integration between research computing and enterprise IT needed to deliver computational tools to an increasingly varied community of researchers requires that institutions recognise the contribution that supportive IT service provision makes to research. The success of any research computing initiative in the biosciences will be judged by the novelty and depth of the biological questions it answers; therefore, performance metrics for people, projects, and processes should be designed to support research.More broadly, growth in cheap, online public access to personalised biological datasets, such as genome sequencing [60], microbiome analysis [61], and biometrics collected from wearable sensor technologies (e.g., fitness trackers and social media apps to record diet), along with the classification of personalised data characterised as the ‘quantified self’ [62], will further fuel the omics revolution. These innovations will define the research questions asked by biologists, not only in response to public demand but also from legislators trying to regulate these new industries. In July 2014, the European Commission led a consultation on medical devices and mobile health (mHealth) apps and proposed a code of conduct [63]. In parallel, manufacturers are in the process of marketing smart technology–enabled medical devices to allow healthcare providers access to patient data, including remote monitoring and cloud-based data-sharing systems. Although the outcomes are too revolutionary to be foreseen, without doubt, computational tools will be vital to the analysis and interpretation of individuals’ data. As the world becomes ever more technologically empowered, we must remember to engage mindfully with computation and the answers that it produces to make certain that we are informed more often than we are misled.Understanding the molecular choreography that allows cells to work, how this is affected by a disease, and our relationships with other living organisms will influence societal attitudes to health and lifestyle, medicine, and our impact on the environment. The imaging revolution, combined with informatics, physical modelling, and visualisation, will lead to profound new insights. The aim of ‘cellular cartography’ is to chart out the whole atlas of the cell, in which all structural and omics information is unified within a single multidimensional, multiscale computational framework [57]. Realising this ambition will place computation at the very centre of biological research and will, therefore, drive a massive uptake of computational tools and skills by bioscientists.']"

Fenretinide is known to have a breadth of effects on cell homeostasis, interfering with retinol binding and transport, cell survival, inducing apoptosis in cancer and RPE cells, and improving insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis in vitro and in vivo [22,23,34,36,49]. Such a pleiotropic variety of effects of fenretinide and its metabolites is achieved by their various molecular targets, and deconvolution of the effects of fenretinide and its metabolites has proven to be quite a challenging endeavor. However, its effects on insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis are now mostly attributed to DES1 inhibition and concomitant decrease in ceramide synthesis [23,42]. Fenretinide-induced cell apoptosis is mediated by different mechanisms, with some being RAR-dependent and some not [14,47,49]. Fenretinide disruption of retinol transport in the eye and the concomitant inhibition of formation of cytotoxic bisretinoids are now largely attributed to its effects on RBP4 retinol transport [25,51]. In our experiments, we did not see changes in A2E bisretinoid accumulation in aged Bco1-/- mice compared to C57BL6 mice, and therefore we don’t expect BCO1 to be a major local source of all-trans-retinal under vitamin A-sufficient diet. We found that MPR is a specific inhibitor of BCO1, but not of SCD1 and DES1. As MPR binds to RBP4, but with lower affinity than retinol or fenretinide, it could be used to target BCO1 in vivo. We previously demonstrated that fenretinide induces an ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of SCD1 in ARPE-19 cells. 3-keto-HPR inhibition of SCD1 expression could follow a similar mechanism [29]. Additionally, as seen from our current and previous data [29,33,49], the effect of fenretinide and 3-keto-HPR on SCD expression cannot be explained by RAR-dependent mechanisms. In contrast, the nonretinoid RBP4-specific ligand A1120 does not affect significantly any of the studied enzymes, though it could weakly affect specificity of DES1 enzyme. The compound A1120 is, so far, the best candidate to target RBP4 in isolation in vivo and therefore could be more advantageous to reduce circulating retinol levels in humans. On the other hand, 3-keto-HPR exerts a stronger inhibitory effect on all the studied enzymes than the parent compound in our experiments and shows the most potential to efficiently induce cancer cell apoptosis in vivo [33,34]. Thus, care should be taken when fenretinide is used in vivo as an inhibitor to account for these and other pleiotropic effects.']"
2014-12-04T00:00:00Z,Selection and Evaluation of Reference Genes for Expression Studies with Quantitative PCR in the Model Fungus Neurospora crassa under Different Environmental Conditions in Continuous Culture,"['The work presented here mirrors the results obtained in recent studies with multiple organisms in which the most appropriate reference genes for use in RT-qPCR were not those commonly employed when using the relative quantification method, underscoring the importance of proper reference gene evaluation and selection. The increased use of RT-qPCR coupled with the realization of the importance of selecting the appropriate reference gene has led to dedicated studies on reference gene selection in both model and non-model organisms, including rats [32], [33], zooplankton [34], fruit crops [35] (Litchi chinensis), and insects [36]–[39]. In some cases, no single gene was found to be stable under all conditions, with stability affected by both endogenous and exogenous factors such as cell type, developmental stage, diet, and environmental stressors [38], [39]. Additionally, reference gene studies have been undertaken in recent years with multiple genera of filamentous fungi. A study evaluating potential reference genes in Trichoderma reesei, similar in industrial importance to N. crassa due to its high secretory capacity for hydrolases, identified sar1, encoding a small GTPase, as most stable, whereas the gene coding for actin (act), did not rank among the best validated ones [40]. In the filamentous fungus Fusarium graminearum, an economically-important plant pathogen, evaluation of 15 genes previously identified as housekeeping genes or those selected from the whole transcriptome sequencing data under different culture conditions found the most appropriate reference genes to vary based on growth stage and/or toxin production [41] and were comprised of genes coding for a cell surface flocculin, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1 alpha, and the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S16.In this study, we identified and validated new reference genes for use in N. crassa expression studies under multiple environmental conditions, including long-term growth in constant darkness, light/dark cycling, and temperature flux in constant darkness. In addition to different environmental conditions, we assessed the time-course variation in reference gene expression by sampling at frequent intervals over a period of >60 hours. These diverse conditions and continuous culture conditions span primary developmental (mycelia, macro- and microconidia) and/or physiological stages, thus increasing the reliability of the reference genes selected in this study. Overall, the results demonstrate that, under the culture conditions described here, vma1, vma2, tbp, and btl serve as the most appropriate reference genes for use in qPCR. We also demonstrated that l6, and to a lesser extent act, often used in the relative quantification method, are less suitable as reference genes in comparison to multiple other genes.']"
2018-08-21T00:00:00Z,Preliminary research on total nitrogen content prediction of sandalwood using the error-in-variable models based on digital image processing,"['With the development of “precision forestry,” there is a bright prospect for forestry information inversion and nutritional diagnosis acquired from digital image processing technology. The images used in this study were selected from different forest farms in the northern cities of Hainan Province. We used field servers to capture and monitor the health condition of sandalwood trees, and by using this equipment, a total nitrogen content prediction method was proposed.Differing from previous studies, we defined a new indicator named GS, which includes two versions: GSMER and GSMCC. The GS indicators together with the color factors are all treated as independent variables during the modeling process, and we used the error-in-variable model to estimate the parameters. This study developed a real-time and precise method to predict the total N content of sandalwood that meets the diagnostic requirement of automation. Our conclusions are as follows:\nSandalwood segmentation of field images can be realized by using the Lab color system. Due to its robustness to illumination changes and its large color range, the Lab color system provides a better result than RGB or other color systems. By applying the Otsu method to each channel, we found that the b channel is suitable for extracting green plants from the background, while the L channel is suitable for separating sandalwood from other plants. Therefore, this study combined those channels together with the Otsu method, median filtering, and morphological processing to complete the segmentation algorithm.\nWe propose a new indicator, named GS, which includes two versions, GSMER and GSMCC, to describe the plant growth status. The combination of this indicator with the color factors provides more stable results regarding both accuracy and precision. After adding the GS indicators, the fitting degree was improved. We obtained better results when using GSMCC than when using GSMER. Therefore, GSMCC, the minimum circumscribed circle, expresses growth status more accurately than does GSMER, the minimum enclosing rectangle.\nConsidering that errors exist in both the color and GSMCC indicators, the error-in-variable model was adopted. Because of segmentation errors cause some color-value and pixel-number deviations, the traditional regression method is not appropriate. We found that the results obtained when using the error-in-variable method were better than those obtained using least squares estimation.\nFive types of models are discussed in this study. Each model type was fit with four color systems: RGB, HSI, Lab and RLI. The optimal model of the total N prediction was selected by comparing the R2 and e¯ values obtained from the modeling data and the R2, e¯, δ2, and MSE values obtained from the validation data. The results showed that the exponential function using the Lab color system yields the most satisfying accuracy and precision in regression and validation.\n']"
2018-04-05T00:00:00Z,"Fungal community profiles in agricultural soils of a long-term field trial under different tillage, fertilization and crop rotation conditions analyzed by high-throughput ITS-amplicon sequencing","['The present study demonstrated alterations in fungal communities of agricultural soils in a long-term field trial due to different tillage and fertilization strategies in two distinct winter wheat fields with maize and rapeseed as preceding crops. Crop rotation is widely accepted to stabilize soil structure and fertility, and to positively affect pathogen and weed control. Furthermore—as described here–it exerts strong selective power on soil mycobiome structures. Although, highest wheat yield was in the long term obtained with conventional practice (ploughing and full N-fertilization, incl. fungicides), fungal genera including relevant pathogens were partly enriched in these field plots. Many potential plant beneficial fungal genera responded positively to pre-crop (e.g. AMF) and only marginally to soil management. The highest AMF diversity was detected in the wheat field with maize as preceding crop, but this had no positive influence on wheat yield, since this was generally higher with pre-crop rapeseed. These rather unexpected results indicate that agro-ecosystem functioning is not yet well understood. Simplistic prospects like high relative pathogen abundance leads to lower yield, or high AMF diversity leads to enhanced plant nutrition and thereby higher yield, fall short in such complex interactions.The concept to implement both ITS regions for amplicon generation and high-throughput sequencing was justified by about 30% more detected fungal taxa compared to the results with only one ITS region included. Challenging for future improvement will be the achievement of higher taxonomic resolution by developing opportunities to link ITS1 and ITS2 sequence information. This would facilitate species identification, which is not possible with physically separated ITS1 and ITS2 sequence reads. Although the newly tested primer pairs performed well, primer biases or variable PCR efficiencies cannot be excluded. Additionally, limitations for validated reference sequences in databases and lack of information about functional and ecological roles of specific fungal taxa in agricultural soils impede complete comprehension. The challenge to present a survey about the inventory of fungal taxa in almost 25 years differently managed soils at the same farming site was designed as a baseline study focusing on reproducibility in the replicated field plots. Since this investigation embeds in a long-term research program (BonaRes) encouraging further studies until 2024, this work will be replicated to estimate the stability of soil mycobiomes over time. Investigating temporal fungal community dynamics throughout the growing season will be another future issue. The here basically ascertained crucial impact of long-term farming practice on soil mycobiota may be regarded as feasible contribution for further research. This could support attempts for soil biodiversity-based agro-ecosystem management to improve productivity of different soils with a wide variety of crops.']"
2013-07-29T00:00:00Z,Gene Expression Analysis of Rice Seedling under Potassium Deprivation Reveals Major Changes in Metabolism and Signaling Components,"['In the present study, comprehensive gene expression analysis was performed using Affymetrix rice genome arrays during short-term potassium deficiency and resupply of potassium to deprived seedlings. A large number of genes were found to be differentially expressed. Taking into account the many potential consequences of the gene expression changes we observed, our study emphasizes the major metabolic adjustments associated with adaptation to the stress of nutrient deficiency. Potassium nutrition impacts a number of metabolic, signaling and physiological processes; together these processes coordinate plant adaptation to low potassium conditions.The overlap of low potassium responses with responses to biotic and abiotic stresses attests to the complex physiological changes triggered by nutrient starvation conditions. Under low potassium conditions, a large array of genes are activated, starting from sensing of nutrient deficiency in the soil to the transducing of this signal by activation of a plethora of signaling networks to, ultimately, the regulation of downstream proteins including transporters, enzymes, and transcription factors. We expect that the transcriptional changes in several diverse physiological and metabolic pathways are critical for adaptive responses to plant potassium deprivation conditon. Besides transcriptional regulation, post-translational modulation could certainly constitute another important mode of regulation in response to low potassium conditions. Despite the complexity of responses to potassium deficiency, we have made a hypothetical model to summarize the results of this study (Figure 7). As described in (Figure 7), low potassium influences metabolic processes and impacts genes related to different stress responses. Although, both processes are interconnected by various signaling pathways, the differential expression of individual components might affect the net signaling output of these highly interrelated processes. The changes in expression patterns of these components might govern the acclimation of the plant to such conditions. Further verification of these differentially expressed genes in planta by genetic and biochemical approaches will provide insights into the mechanistic regulation of these gene (s) during low potassium stress conditions, which ultimately can be translated to develop plants that can grow on soil with relatively low levels of potassium without compromising yield and productivity.10.1371/journal.pone.0070321.g007Figure 7\nModel of plant responses and adaptation to potassium deficiency.\nUnder low K+ conditions a large number of genes are affected. This condition alters plant metabolic as well as signaling responses. During K+ deprivation conditons, the initial reaction of plant is to sense the K+ deficiency followed by activation of several genes and gene networks, which might be working in tandem. As depected several genes encoding metabolic enzymes, protein involved in stress signaling, transporters, transcription factors could be the final target to bring about a physiological response such as tolerance or adaptation to low-K+ condition. Putative factors of K+ deficiency and adaptive responses are shown in boxes. Genes of related components are written below the boxes.\n']"
2015-07-06T00:00:00Z,Century-Long Warming Trends in the Upper Water Column of Lake Tanganyika,"['Our update and synthesis of in situ temperature data from Lake Tanganyika demonstrates that long-term warming rates in Lake Tanganyika vary with latitude, distance from shore, and with the seasonal cycle. Though our statistical approach to the incomplete space-time matrix of in situ observations from Lake Tanganyika has limitations, it nonetheless reveals consistent patterns of spatial variation in warming that illustrate a need to assess the spatial dimensions of warming within large lakes. This variation is most likely driven by variation in vertical mixing; areas and times of year with low vertical mixing experience the fastest warming rates. This pattern may be observed in other large lakes with spatial and temporal variation in vertical mixing patternsed quantitativeterpretationof water.odelled in situ temperature revealed important differences between thee methods and a. There are few large lakes where time series of in situ observations encompass a wide enough range of locations to estimate spatial variation in warming rates. Such comparisons have been made over shorter time scales in other large lakes, and have revealed substantial differences in warming across the surface of lakes [35,36]. The analyses of spatial variation in lake skin temperatures for Lake Tanganyika from satellites could be an informative complement to our work on spatially distributed in situ data.The broad quantitative agreement between temperature records from satellites and in situ instrumental data engenders new confidence in the records themselves as well as their implications for climate change effects. Unfortunately, there are few lakes in the world that have temperature records from multiple methods spanning over a century of change. Of the lakes that have well-preserved sediments, few also have both long-term in situ temperature records and surface area large enough for unobstructed satellite-based measurements. Lakes Baikal and Malawi could provide all three types of records, thereby broadening perspectives on the effects of climate change on surface temperatures as well as testing whether our reinterpretation of the TEX86 paleolimnological temperature proxy could be correct for other lakes.As the oxic zone shallows in Lake Tanganyika, aerobic organisms will be forced upward in the water column where temperatures are both warmest already and rising fastest. Higher temperatures exact metabolic costs for these organisms, potentially reducing their discretionary energy available for growth and reproduction [37,38]. Reduced vertical mixing associated with thermal shifts has already diminished internal nutrient loading, leading to reduced primary productivity and shifts in phytoplankton assemblages [11,13,14]. Warm lakes like Lake Tanganyika are especially vulnerable to warming-driven shifts in lake stratification due to the nonlinear relationship between water density and water temperature. The combination of reduced oxic habitat, increased metabolic demands, and lower primary productivity is likely to have negative effects on the lake’s ecosystem and the hundreds of thousands of people who depend on the lake for their nutrition and livelihoods.']"
2019-08-28T00:00:00Z,Neural computational model GrowthEstimate: A model for studying living resources through digestive efficiency,"['The neural computational model GrowthEstimate is developed using the combined inputs of normalized weight (g), normalized digestive efficiency (T/C ratio), and protein growth efficiency through the normalized condition factor (CF, 100 × g cm–3). The model could precisely estimate the weight specific growth rate (SGR, % day–1) of living resources, especially in natural marine and freshwater ecosystems where food availability, consumption rates, and growth rates are unknown. However, the trained model should be improved with additional datasets with similar data points from different species at different development stages. Determinations of the activities of trypsin and chymotrypsin in the pyloric caeca and small intestine for the T/C ratio study, including other biochemical techniques for studying the performance qualities of growth and maturation in aquatic living resources, are described in [4,28]. The advantages of simultaneously using different biochemical techniques developed by Rungruangsak-Torrissen and her research team are described [10,12,13,28,51], and summarized in [1–4]. The importance of the specific activity levels of trypsin and chymotrypsin for fish growth is similar to the importance of the levels of acceleration and braking capacity for car speed, respectively. A higher acceleration (trypsin specific activity) is needed to increase car speed (fish growth), and a higher braking capacity (chymotrypsin specific activity) is necessary for stopping a car (fish) at a higher speed (higher growth) [4,13,51].This study provides a research revelation resulted from an excellent collaboration between different research fields in life science (nutritional biochemistry) and computational neuroscience. Insights from the breakthrough of the biological studies [1–4,7] have provided the unique key biological factors, indicating the growth performance quality of living resources through the digestive efficiency T/C ratio and condition factor (as protein growth efficiency). These factors are applicable for practical studies directly in natural ecosystems where individuals in populations, environmental conditions, food availability and consumption rates cannot be controlled. The newly developed neural computational model GrowthEstimate in this study, using reservoir-based recurrent neural networks, is a promising technique for precise and comparable growth estimates of living resources. The GrowthEstimate software, using the weight, T/C ratio, and CF, as its inputs, and providing the estimation of SGR as its output, can be a valuable tool for fishery scientists and other researchers in studying the growth rates of individual fishes, without knowing about food availability, consumption rates, and their genetics. Thus, it can be used as a powerful tool for future food utilization and growth studies, especially in natural ecosystems. Such studies will improve our knowledge and make a difference in studying biochemical effects of environmental impact and climate change on the survival and growth of living resources.']"
2016-05-16T00:00:00Z,Impact of Wild Loci on the Allergenic Potential of Cultivated Tomato Fruits,"['Previous studies have shown that the choice of tomato cultivar significantly influences the allergic reaction of tomato allergic subjects [2]. This work aims to address the question of whether the introgression of genomic regions from the wild species S. pennellii in the genomic background of cultivated tomato line (M82) may influence the allergenic potential of tomato fruits. It points out that when this species is used in breeding schemes to transfer favourable alleles in cultivated tomato varieties, it is also crucial to assess the risk linked to the potential allergenicity of the new-developed plant material. Indeed, we identified the PG2A (Solyc10g080210), the PME1 (Solyc07g064170) and PME2.1 (Solyc07g064180), the nsLTP (Solyc10g075090) and the profilin as the main allergens present in tomato fruits. In addition, we confirmed the different allergenic potential of the pulp and the peel, with this latter showing a higher allergenic potential.We showed that there are genomic regions from wild tomato species, such as Solanum pennellii, that may deeply influence the allergenic potential of tomato fruits. Indeed, fruits harvested from the introgression line IL7-3 harbour a higher total allergenic potential compared to those from the cultivated genotype M82 and from IL12-4. On the contrary, lower IgE-mediated allergic reactions were observed in extracts of IL12-4 compared to IL7-3 and M82. The variability in the allergenic potential among the three tomato lines was mostly due to differences in IgE recognition patterns of a PG2A (46 kDa), one of the major tomato allergen, and of a PME1 (34 kDa) that were more immunoreactive in IL7-3 compared to IL12-4 and M82.We demonstrated that the allergenicity of tomato fruits is not always linked to different expression levels of the allergen-encoding genes, rather it relays on the line-dependent translational control or post-translational modifications. In particular, analyses carried out in this study suggest that the allergenicity of tomato fruits may be associated to different glycan structures of the identified proteins. Now, further studies aiming at dissecting the two ILs into sub-lines that carry introgressed regions of reduced size compared to the existing ones are underway. It is very likely that these efforts will contribute to isolate, in a more accurate way, the favorable wild genes responsible for the low allergenic potential of the region 4 on chromosome 12. At the same time, the identification of the unfavorable wild genes that determine the high allergenic potential of the region 3 on chromosome 7 can be achieved.Altogether, the identification of genetic resources with different allergenic potential represents a valuable tool both to understand the molecular basis of tomato allergic disease and for the development of novel hypoallergenic varieties. Allergic subjects could benefit from the development of such hypoallergenic tomato fruits since they could avoid eliminating completely this important crop from their diet, increasing their quality of life. However, it is worth saying that the potential hypoallergenicity of tomatoes cannot be generalised for all the allergic subjects, since it has to be assessed according to the specific allergenic protein to which every single allergic subject is sensitised [8].']"
2017-06-12T00:00:00Z,"Insects and associated arthropods analyzed during medicolegal death investigations in Harris County, Texas, USA: January 2013- April 2016","['The integration of full time forensic entomology services to the medical examiner’s office in Harris County has revealed new observations, confirmed long-standing hypotheses and opened up a wide range of new opportunities. The casework described here is not an endpoint and new species observations and associations continue to be revealed. This study represents a reference point from which to describe additional observations and trends and from which to compare other geographic locations and species assemblages. These data also remind us that depending upon generalizations and assumptions can be misleading and that keeping an open mind and collecting something that may at first seem trivial may prove to be exceptionally useful.The data presented here also have illustrated several persistent issues in the application of forensic entomology to casework. While molecular identification tools are being more widely developed and applied to morphologically difficult groups (e.g. Sarcophagidae and Muscidae) there are significant gaps in development datasets. A single development dataset is available for B. plinthopyga which was never intended for use in application to forensic entomology as it is includes total generation time [51]. Yet this species is considerably important to casework in Harris County (Table 2). There are no known published development datasets for C. coloradensis, Calliphora livida Hall (Diptera: Calliphoridae) or Dermestes maculatus DeGeer (Coleoptera: Dermestidae) using a diet that approximates human tissue (i.e. human or porcine tissue [52]). The suggested practice of using closely related species to approximate development for those species that have missing data introduces unnecessary uncertainty in an estimate of TOC and its application to PMI. Furthermore there is growing awareness that different populations of the same species have different developmental responses to the same temperatures over large [53] and relatively small geographic distances [54]. Several of the species that are common and important to casework in Harris County lack local development datasets including C. megacephala, S. nudiseta, L. eximia and L. cuprina. This strongly suggests that using development datasets from populations not local to the collection location for the case may introduce uncertainty to a case that becomes difficult to incorporate into a TOC estimate.While missing development datasets can be generated, other issues continue to haunt forensic entomology casework that are not and will not be as easy to remedy. In 1992, Catts [55] outlined several complications in using insects to estimate postmortem interval. These issues, such as maggot mass heat, insect access and entomotoxicology, continue to be sources of uncertainty for the application of forensic entomology to casework. It has only been relatively recently that there has been an increased awareness for the need to account for uncertainty and sources of error in forensic entomology within the context of all forensic sciences in the US [56]. In addition, while identifying potential sources of error is more widely appreciated, accounting for how these errors impact TOC and PMI estimates has not yet been resolved. Tackling these challenges will require strong collaboration between academic and practitioner parts of the community, and the results will make forensic entomology an even more powerful tool in understanding the post-mortem interval.']"
2017-10-05T00:00:00Z,"The gastric microbiome, its interaction with Helicobacter pylori, and its potential role in the progression to stomach cancer","['Evidence that the host microbiota specifically functions to promote health and prevent disease and that dysbiosis contributes to inflammation, susceptibility to pathogens, and diseases (including cancer) is undisputed [3]. As a result, the concept of specific microorganisms solely driving cancer initiation and progression may need to be modified in certain circumstances. Although great advances have been made in understanding the complex interplay between the gastric microbiota and H. pylori in the development of gastric inflammation and cancer, detailed studies are still needed in well-defined human populations to compare differences in the microbiota of H. pylori-infected persons with and without neoplastic lesions. Cross-sectional studies can provide initial insights into microbial associations with cancer; however, reverse effects are a concern, as it is difficult to discern whether carcinogenesis leads to changes in the local microenvironment that creates a new niche for microbes or whether alterations in the microbial population or its functions contribute to carcinogenesis [33]. Due to the acidic nature of the stomach, most bacteria cannot survive in this environment. However, infection with H. pylori leads to achlorhydria of the stomach in a subset of colonized persons; thus, long-term H. pylori colonization and neutralization of the gastric environment may directly contribute to alterations in the gastric microbiota.Since the gastric microbiota is more austere in terms of microbial breadth and depth compared to the intestinal microbiota, future studies should focus on assessing whether the composition of the gastric microbiome in different anatomical regions of the stomach exerts differential effects on cancer risk. This could be done through site-specific topographical mapping of the microbiota in the presence or absence of H. pylori as well as assessing differences in relation to different disease states along the gastric carcinogenesis cascade. Clearly, longitudinal studies that utilize sequential sampling to elucidate the temporal nature of microbial associations with premalignant lesions are needed. Details regarding patient populations, including age, gender, diet, and other comorbidities need to be assessed and compared in a rigorous fashion to discern whether any of these variables affect the potential for the gastric microbiome to influence disease. Since studies of the gastric microbiota have largely focused on bacterial communities, more in depth studies elucidating effects of other microorganisms that potentially populate the stomach in addition to bacteria, including fungi, protists, archaea, and viruses, are needed to fully characterize the gastric microbiome and its relationship with cancer risk. Furthermore, to more definitively determine cause versus effect, studies may also need to incorporate humanized mouse models to discern effects of the human gastric microbiome on disease. As we begin to understand and elucidate the specific role of the gastric microbiota and its effects on human health and disease, studies of these microbial populations in innovative systems will likely yield translational opportunities to reduce gastric cancer morbidity and mortality by improving screening, prevention, and treatment. It is tempting to speculate that future studies will identify specific combinatorial populations of bacteria that are predictive of pathologic outcomes, yielding strategies to manipulate the microbiota to ultimately prevent disease.']"
2017-07-26T00:00:00Z,Prehistoric mitochondrial DNA of domesticate animals supports a 13th century exodus from the northern US southwest,"['Scholars have debated the role of migration in the collapse of ancestral Pueblo societies of the Four Corners region (including Southwest Colorado) and the coincident emergence of the Rio Grande Pueblos. Previous studies of biological variation using morphometric traits [3, 4:87–124] have found evidence of population movement from the CMV to the NRG during the 13th century CE. Due to repatriation and native population discontinuity in the four corners region it is not currently possible to confirm these morphometric findings through analyses of contemporary or ancient human DNA. We have therefore considered mtDNA from remains of domestic species as a proxy for human population relationships. Domestic dogs and turkeys were sampled from three temporal/geographic groups for analysis: the pre-migration CMV (pre-1280 CE), the pre-migration NRG (pre-1280 CE), and the post-migration NRG (post-1280 CE).Our analyses show that many of the canid remains were of coyotes, and isotopic analyses confirm that these coyotes consumed sources of carbon comparatively less enriched in 13C than those consumed by dogs. Although these results are tangential to our primary research question, they are still informative in that they are consistent with a scenario in which the dogs consumed a diet rich in maize, perhaps supplemented by some turkeys that also ate maize, whereas the coyotes likely subsisted on a wide range of wild resources rich in C3-derived carbon. As a result of no dogs being identified from post-migration NRG sites, we lack the necessary samples to test for discontinuity between pre-migration and post-migration NRG dogs. However, we were not able to detect statistically-significant genetic differences between pre-migration CMV and NRG dogs.In contrast, our analyses of turkey mtDNA, combined with results of previous studies, provide evidence that the turkey population of the post-migration NRG exhibits genetic continuity with the pre-migration CMV turkey population, and both exhibit genetic discontinuity with the pre-migration NRG turkey population. These results are consistent with an influx of turkeys to the NRG during the 13th century, and the CMV was not excluded as a possible source for these birds. They also suggest the post-1280 CE NRG turkey population could not have derived wholly from the pre-1280 population from this region. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that migrating human populations from the CMV brought domestic turkeys with them to the NRG, leading to a change in the mtDNA composition of the post-1280 CE NRG turkey population. This study thus provides the first direct genetic evidence, by way of a domestic animal proxy, in support of the hypothesis that Tewa communities occupying the NRG region today derive in large measure from the migration of 13th century CMV populations. If true, this would support a scenario in which migration was a primary solution of CMV populations in the face of significant social and environmental problems [2, 4, 49–51], as it often is for human groups under extreme duress today.']"
2018-12-05T00:00:00Z,"Screening, diagnosis, and long-term health outcomes in developing countries—The case of hypertension","['Using a large sample of hypertensive respondents from a longitudinal data set in Indonesia, we estimated the effect of a prior hypertension diagnosis on current incidence and severity of hypertension. We found that screening and diagnosis has significant positive effects and results in a lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure and in a lower overall incidence of hypertension. These results are contrary to the strand of literature that is arguing that screening and diagnosis are often ineffective and/or much more expensive than treatment. We argue that the role of diagnosis is purely informational and it is therefore essential to distinguish between different types of afflictions when performing such studies. Since different health problems have different available courses of treatment, the effects of a prior diagnose on current or future health outcomes are highly dependent on the availability and overall cost of these treatments.We also investigated the channels through which hypertension diagnosis leads to lowering blood pressure and found medication to be the most important one. Some patients who are diagnosed are prescribed medication which then directly leads to lower blood pressure. We also found modest but significantly higher rates of certain life-style changes among diagnosed patients. Being diagnosed results in less smoking, more physical activity, and more regular monitoring of blood pressure. On the other hand, we found no significant effects on diet, BMI, and overweight status. We find these results as expected, since hypertension medication is relatively cheap, while life-style changes are often hard and costly to adopt. An interesting avenue for future research might be to consider the role of mental health and social interactions in managing hypertension. Arguably there is quite a bit of interplay between these and maintaining healthy dietary habits, smoking, and even exercising. For instance, Bustamante et al. [16] find that hypertension management, in particular through weight management, is significantly affected by the existence of social support.That being said, given the extent of the medical literature that documents the importance of such life-style changes in managing hypertension, we argue that these should be first order items on the agenda of public policy as it relates to public health. Our overall results suggest dedicating resources both towards improving diagnosis rates and also towards education regarding the importance of adopting a healthy life-style and not only relying on medication.As developing countries go through a health transition, from dealing mainly with infectious diseases to dealing mainly with chronic diseases, large countries like Indonesia or China have seen rapidly rising rates of hypertension among their populations. At the same time, due to the asymptomatic nature of hypertension and to a lack of resources and established medical routines, much of the afflicted population is not diagnosed and are largely unaware of being hypertensive. Given our results, it is therefore imperative for public policy in such countries to dedicate more resources towards addressing the under-diagnosis problem and educating the public on how to adopt a healthy life-style in the face of a rapidly changing economy.']"
2015-04-16T00:00:00Z,Digital Detection of Multiple Minority Mutants and Expression Levels of Multiple Colorectal Cancer-Related Genes Using Digital-PCR Coupled with Bead-Array,"['In this study, a sensitive and specific assay for digitally detecting MUTs and expression levels of multiple genes on a hydrogel bead-array was developed. By combining MLPA and bead-based emPCR, single-molecule amplification with common primers used for all targets was achieved. MLPA was applied in the preparation of templates with universal ends from DNA and cDNA samples from different sources, which favors multiplex amplification. Unlike analog amplification in conventional PCR reactions, >106 individual amplification reactions can be carried out simultaneously in one tube with bead-based emPCR.Beads are immobilized as a single layer on a hydrogel chip to complete high-throughput detection. Compared with the common methods of using acrylamide in electrophoresis to separate proteins and nucleic acids, MLPA–DABA uses polyacrylamide gel to embed the beads. The prepolymer of the acrylamide monomer with beads is dotted on acryl-modified glass and the polymerization is performed to embed the beads on the surface of the glass chip with ammonium persulfate and tetramethylethylenediamine. Because of the high permeability of gels with a 3-dimentional porous structure, the mismatched probes and other impurities embedded in the porous structure can freely pass through the structure; therefore, the probes and impurities can be effectively eliminated by electrophoresis. The high performance of hydrogel overcomes the problems experienced with other methods, such as the high background interference from inadequate washing of the remaining probes. In MLPA–DABA, the background was significantly reduced; subsequently, the sensitivity and specificity of MLPA–DABA were greatly improved. Moreover, because polyacrylamide gel has amphiphilic and uncharged characteristics, the biocompatibility is conducive to hybridization of probes and targets in a solution-like environment.Because the diagnosis of diseases is made based on the general information of multiple genes, it is not necessary to measure a genetic MUT or the expression of a specific cancer-related gene. A panel of multiple genes as a single diagnostic biomarker demonstrates a more marked difference than individual genes. In MLPA–DABA, one type of fluorescent signal with one color was applied to reflect multiple MUTs and expressions of multiple CRC-related genes. Both general information about the total expression of cancer-related genes and an overall MUT rate are achieved by calculating the ratio of the total number of green beads from various sources to the number of red beads. It is noteworthy that the main steps in the process of MUT detection and the process of gene expression analysis are identical; therefore, MLPA–DABA is capable of analyzing both simultaneously on the same chip platform, which is highly desirable in cancer diagnosis. The use of MLPA–DABA, which has the advantages of being tumor-specific; requiring easy sampling, has great accuracy; is noninvasive to the body; and requires no diet preparation before the test in comparison with other non-invasive methods, such as colonoscopy and fecal occult blood test, is promising for analyzing exfoliated cells in stool samples from CRC patients and will become a powerful tool for non-invasive and early diagnosis of CRC.']"
2015-04-01T00:00:00Z,Serving First in Isolation Increases Vegetable Intake among Elementary Schoolchildren,"['The United States is fighting an ongoing battle to improve its health, with 35% of adults considered obese and an additional 34% considered overweight [37]. A popular recommendation for better health is greater consumption of fruits and vegetables [38–40], especially among young children. Unfortunately, past efforts to increase vegetable intake have been largely disappointing [11, 13, 14, 29]. Our work provides an explanation for why many past interventions may have had little effect: vegetables are usually presented alongside better-liked foods. This salient disadvantage in liking is then difficult to overcome with interventions that are based solely on education and raising awareness. Put simply, it is difficult to get a person to eat something they only slightly like when more preferred foods are also available.Our findings suggest that a more effective strategy is instead to serve the vegetables first in isolation. Three experiments established that serving carrots and broccoli first in isolation successfully increased consumption of these foods. This approach leverages a rule that people seem to follow: eat a single food that is in front of you. In some ways, this behavior seems fairly intuitive, but in other ways there is nothing intuitive about getting a child to eat a vegetable they find barely acceptable. Our findings are indeed quite inconsistent with a fully rational decision maker who, knowing they will have other foods in the future, can just choose to skip whatever food is presented first and eat only the foods they like the most. Of course, presentation order of a food is not the only consideration, as people may still rely on their beliefs about the foods, dieting goals, or the behavior of those around them. Even so, we found a consistent effect of presentation order in our studies. Future work can still explore how the relative contribution of other factors may depend on the context.Our work contributes to the literature in several important ways. We provide a novel low-cost approach to increase vegetable consumption among the notoriously challenging population of elementary school children. This group chronically under-consumes vegetables and has proven resistant to many interventions with the goal to increase vegetable consumption [14, 29, 41]. We expect that the strength of our results coupled with the ease of serving vegetables first make our intervention applicable to a wide range of settings (most cafeterias, restaurants, or meals in the home). Our findings also generalize past work on eating vegetables first [23] in several critical ways. We show that serving a food first can increase intake for a less-liked food (carrots and broccoli), versus just well-liked foods, which is essential for promoting the consumption of vegetables. We also show our effects persist even with repeated exposures spanning nearly two months, and with children not actively supervised by a parent or guardian (an understudied setting). Finally, we also combine our field data with a lab study to provide support for our proposed theory over alternative accounts based in contrast or satiety effects. Overall, we establish an intervention to promote vegetable consumption, demonstrate its sizable effect, show its robust nature, and provide insight into the conditions that promote it. The effectiveness of our intervention is notable in that it produced sizable effects with very little effort, and appeared robust to different foods and even repeated exposures. This resembles other approaches rooted in behavioral economics such as suggesting norms [42], redesigning cafeteria processes [43], and offers to downsize [44]. In our first cafeteria study, merely placing cups of carrots on the table before students arrived increased carrot consumption by more than a factor of four. The net result was an increase in carrot consumption of 10.3 g, or .13 portions, which favorably compares to the average increase of .07 portions in vegetable consumption found in a recent meta-analysis for interventions targeted at children aged 9 to 12 years [41]. This suggests that school cafeterias, as well as parents, not serving vegetables first in isolation (which is likely true for most cafeterias and homes) could benefit from our findings.Given the effectiveness of our intervention relative to its implementation cost, future work should test our simple intervention across a range of settings. This should include cafeterias with a range of mealtime procedures so our intervention can apply as widely as possible. We have successfully implemented two different procedures in our field studies, but others are possible. The logistics of serving vegetables first may prove particularly challenging to commercial food service establishments. We also confirmed that our intervention remained effective over three repeated exposures, but had few lingering effects once removed. This suggests that cafeterias should consider making serving vegetables first in isolation a permanent part of their procedures. Of course, further investigation with longitudinal field experiments are still necessary to shed light on the long-term effectiveness of this intervention strategy. As well, future work should examine how eating more vegetables influences future consumption. If our intervention indeed reduces subsequent intake of less healthy foods, as we expect it might, then it could prove quite effective at improving one’s diet.We believe that eating vegetables first in isolation may prove useful to a wide range of audiences that include children, dieters, parents, school officials, and public policy makers. Parents, for example, might increase vegetable consumption by simply serving vegetables as an appetizer before serving the rest of the meal. Future research could also test whether our intervention encourages habit formation. Past work has shown it takes multiple tastes to develop a liking for a food [45], so any instance of eating vegetables may increase the likelihood of eating it again in the future. Regardless, we propose that by isolating vegetables as a first course, those trying to increase vegetable consumption have a greater likelihood of immediate success.']"
2019-08-14T00:00:00Z,(-)-Oleocanthal and (-)-oleocanthal-rich olive oils induce lysosomal membrane permeabilization in cancer cells,"['Although several groups have demonstrated oleocanthal’s ability to inhibit key proteins that promote cell growth and survival [12, 14–17, 39], a unifying mechanism for the specific and irreversible cellular death-inducing properties of oleocanthal has not been established. In this report, we observed that a transient exposure of cancer cells to oleocanthal for one hour resulted in the loss of cell viability after 24 hours. Although a classic apoptotic mechanism has been proposed [16, 20, 21], in our hands the rapid cell death caused by oleocanthal was necrotic. Specifically, viable cells were not observed to display phosphatidylserine on the outer membrane leaflet as evidenced by staining with AV, a well-established phase in the apoptotic cascade. Furthermore, using three different and complementary methods, we demonstrated that oleocanthal-treated cells undergo LMP. The latest, most robust method to assess LMP is the galectin translocation assay [33]. We observed that oleocanthal treated MCF7 breast cancer cells showed robust galectin-3 translocation to lysosomes, similar to that observed with the established LMP inducer LLOMe. In a biochemical assay that checks the leakage of lysosomal enzymes into the cytosol, we observed a pronounced leakage of both cathepsin D and cathepsin B to the cytosol in PC3 prostate and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The translocation of cathepsins of two different sizes suggests that the lysosomal membrane undergoes permeabilization. Agents that are known to cause LMP with only minimal cathepsin release, such as LLMOe [37] enable cells to survive the initial LMP and repair their lysosomal membrane. Other agents that cause the release of cathepsin D (a small hydrolase) but not the release of cathepsin B (a larger hydrolase) are often associated with apoptosis [22]. We, therefore, conclude that the degree of lysosomal damage in the case of oleocanthal is massive and leads to rapid necrosis in the affected cancer cells with less and survivable damage to normal cells.It was previously suggested that many cancer cells are more vulnerable to attacks on their lysosomes because they have larger and more fragile lysosomes [42] and are more reliant on lysosomal processes metabolically [27]. Furthermore, many cancer cells upregulate lysosomal biogenesis and lysosomal enzyme turnover [27]. Therefore, once lysosomal enzymes and acids are released into the cytosol en mass, rapid cell toxicity ensues [43]. The effect of oleocanthal was observed in both cell culture and a live mouse model for the development of PNETs [41] where lifespan was extended by 4 weeks (29%). It has been reported that 2.6 adult mice days are equivalent to one human year [44]. Based on this life-span conversion, oleocanthal might extend life 10.4 years for PNET pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer patients. Importantly, the cancer cells from the PNETs when put in culture released cathepsin upon oleocanthal treatment and died rapidly.In addition to looking into the effects of purified oleocanthal, we were very interested to see if oleocanthal in a more natural form can cause a similar outcome. Since different olive oils are known to have varied oleocanthal concentrations as a function of their origin, harvest time, and processing methods [7], we examined several olive oils with varied concentrations of oleocanthal from very low to very high. For our in vitro experiments, we used two EVOOs with average low oleocanthal content and two with very high oleocanthal content (about 5 times the average), and for our negative control we used two oils that contained no measurable oleocanthal. Upon treatment of cultured cancer cells with oil enriched cell culture media we observed that the concentration of oleocanthal in the oil was directly related to the toxicity of the oils towards cancer cells. The oils with the high oleocanthal content completely killed the cancer cells in a manner similar to purified oleocanthal. The oils with the average oleocanthal content, also reduced viability but to a lesser extent. The non EVOOs with no oleocanthal had no effect on cell viability. The same oils had little to no effect on non-cancer cells. Furthermore, by looking at cytosolic cathepsin release, the EVOOs mechanism of promoting cancer cell death also involved LMP, similar to the effects of purified oleocanthal.Many studies have linked consumption of EVOO with reduced incidence of cancer [4], most significantly a randomized trial in which elevated EVOO in the diet led to a 62% reduction in the incidence of breast cancer in Spain over a 5 year period [5]. Data provided here link the cytotoxic effects of EVOOs to their level of oleocanthal. The cytotoxic effects were due to the ability of oleocanthal to induce LMP and necrotic cell death preferentially in cancer cells. Whereas pure oleocanthal can also have negative effects on non-cancerous cells, EVOO is considered safe and healthy and, therefore, could be both preventative as well as a potential treatment–as indicated by the Spanish study [5]. Since the apparent target for oleocanthal-induced necrosis is the lysosome, the reason for the elevated sensitivity of cancer cells to oleocanthal could be due to the increased size and fragility of the lysosomal compartment of cancer cells [27]. If the enlarged fragile lysosomal compartment [23, 42] is the reason for increased sensitivity to oleocanthal, it is likely that EVOOs with high oleocanthal could be preventative for many cancers–in addition to reduced breast cancer in Spain [5]. Whether purified oleocanthal could be used therapeutically remains to be evaluated. How can one determine whether there are high levels of oleocanthal in an EVOO? EVOOs with high oleocanthal levels produce a unique stinging sensation in the back of the throat and not elsewhere in the mouth, as well as eliciting a brief coughing that has been used to determine the presence of oleocanthal in EVOO [8]. Tasting EVOO for this signature stinging sensation and cough elicitation could allow people to identify EVOOs with high oleocanthal content without sophisticated equipment. In light of the results presented in this report, and since EVOOs have been safely used in the diet for millennia and are associated with good health, the authors believe that consuming more EVOO with high oleocanthal content is a prudent dietary approach to cancer prevention with the caveat that dietary oils convey calories and consequently other caloric sources will have to yield to avoid obesity.']"
2020-02-05T00:00:00Z,An examination of the association between lifetime history of prostate and pancreatic cancer diagnosis and occupation in a population sample of Canadians,"['We know, reasonably well, from different studies done in other countries, as well as smaller studies in Canada, that between two and 10 per cent of cancers are caused by occupational exposure [28,29,39,40,53]. The current study evaluated occupational associations with history of prostate and pancreatic cancer and found significant relationships for both type of cancers. The occupations revealed here suggest possible occupational exposures or other factors which may predispose individuals to an increased risk of disease. This information is important for if we know more about the types of exposures that cause prostate and pancreatic cancer, we should be able to act on it, as occupational exposure is preventable. The challenge moving forward will be confirming these findings and making sure we have policies and legislation appropriate to the carcinogenic hazard (e.g., possible organohalogen, pesticides, or biocides exposure).This study aimed to highlight which occupations have an increased risk of PCa or pancreatic cancer so that further investigations may be completed to more accurately identify the causative agents. Preventive and awareness educational occupation programs and strategies for risk reduction can also be applied using the hierarchy of controls for at risk occupations. Additional research on the exposures associated with each occupation, but also evaluating the association with the province of residence, would be an asset for future research.\nStudy limitations\nThis study has some limitations. Employment history was obtained only for one point in time (June 4, 1991) and does not contain data on duration; however; occupation at the time of survey is still representative of the exposure and activities which the individual may have participated in during this time period and serves well as a proxy for exposure. Furthermore, higher age categories such as 44–64 would most likely represent a stable and long-standing job.\nThe data set lacks information on family history, physical activity, smoking, diet and other lifestyle factors and comorbidities which may have affected these associations. Adjusting for income and education level does account for some smoking and lifestyle factors which have their own unique cancer risk. This study did not use detailed information on cancer histology which means that aggressive and indolent forms of cancer could not be discerned. Future studies should attempt to extend the investigation to other forms of cancer. Another limitation of this study is the lack of control for ethnicity in our statistical analyses which could have affected our estimates if there a disproportionate distribution of ethnicity by occupation is present [54].\nAnother limitation of this study is that it did not include measures of social inequalities in cancer which are crucial public health issues affecting particularly disadvantaged individuals. For example, in Canada and USA, the incidence rates of several preventable cancers including pancreatic cancer are generally higher in the Indigenous populations than in the non-Indigenous populations [55]. For prostate cancer, however, the incidence is increased among groups with higher SES, while late-stage prostate cancer is diagnosed more frequently among groups low on SES [56]. Incidence of prostate cancer is higher, compared to other forms of cancer also, at least partially, due to detection of many, otherwise non-detectable (symptom wise), early-stage cancers which result from differential participation in cancer screening, either organized (because an individual has reached the age of screening, e.g., 50 years in most Canadian provinces) or because the opportunity is there for screening.\nSocio-economic, political, legislative and technology access and development forces impact the distribution of cancer risk factors in a population, and affect access to health services, which subsequently translate in specific observed inequalities in cancer risk and outcomes. Not included in this study are also psychosocial factors, such as mental health, known to lead in the adoption of unhealthy behaviours such as substance use, poor diet and lifestyle factors (e.g., poor sleeping and eating habits) and the exposure to a greater variety and intensity of cancer risk factors than their counterparts.\nLastly, while statistically significant, a number of occupations we examined have a CI that approach 1.0 (Tables 1 & 2). Since there is a tenuous link discussed in the introduction to chemical exposures that is not analyzed in this study, it might be reasonable to infer that these exposures are at the route of the cancer diagnosis. However, it is likely that the link is much more complex. To further understand these associations, high quality data on populations within populations are needed. Future studies should attempt to link Human Development Index, a proxy for the socioeconomic development of a country, with the magnitude and profile of pancreatic and prostate cancer to explain the distribution of cancer risk at the national level. Future studies should examine population data within populations, and stratify their analyses based on this information. Multisectoral action (socioeconomic, political, legislative) may be required to find effective solutions to the prevailing inequalities in cancer risk [57].\nThere are several strengths to this study. This study utilizes the largest dataset available for the Canadian population. This allowed for large sample sizes for history of prostate cancer (n = 28,610) and pancreatic cancer (n = 3,220) to be analyzed. The study also adjusted for several variables including age, sex, province of residence, income, education level, immigration status and occupation. This level of analysis also helps to account for differences in socioeconomic status and various lifestyle factors.\nFurthermore, in Canada, labour laws and healthcare provisions may differ from other regions, making existing literature unreliable for our unique population. Provinces vary in age distribution, geographical factors and population size, which effects healthcare resource allotment including prevention, detection and treatment [8].\nOther parameters such as marital status and ethnicity were omitted from this study but included in Sritharan et al [29]. Our study also includes occupational associations of pancreatic cancer which have not been evaluated at this scale in Canada. Furthermore, the recent publication on prostate cancer can be used as a benchmark to confirm that the models generated in this study are correct, as similar results were obtained and therefore have been included for completeness.\n']"
2015-07-23T00:00:00Z,Effect of Global Regulators RpoS and Cyclic-AMP/CRP on the Catabolome and Transcriptome of Escherichia coli K12 during Carbon- and Energy-Limited Growth,"['In our study, we have provided a comprehensive analysis of role of the global regulators cAMP and RpoS in E. coli under well-defined carbon- and energy-limited growth conditions. The lack of rpoS resulted in an enhanced fitness both under glucose-excess and glucose-limited conditions, whereas the lack of cAMP had a drastic negative effect on growth performance (Tables 1 and 3). The transcriptome data were confirmed by catabolome analysis, expression of periplasmic proteins and phenotypical analysis. The results obtained with the different methods were consistent. Thus, the picture obtained strongly suggests that the expression of a broad range of high-affinity uptake systems and of enzymes involved in the central metabolism (citric acid cycle and of glycolysis) were severely repressed in the absence of cAMP. Furthermore, the presented results are in agreement with flux analysis [62] and a transcriptome study performed in complex medium [38,39]. Hence, one can predict that the Δcya strain must exhibit a worse affinity than the wild-type strain not only for glucose but also for a broad range of other carbon sources. On the contrary, absence or down-regulation of RpoS would result in increased competitiveness of E. coli in the environment. These results are in agreement with the trade-off between self-preservation and nutritional competence (SPANC [98]). High variability in RpoS expression from several E. coli strains was reported, where high RpoS expression resulted in high resistance at the cost of lower competitiveness, e.g., reduced catabolic flexibility [98,99].The alarmone ppGpp, which is involved in the expression/stability of RpoS [100,101] and is necessary for the transcription of several genes belonging to the RpoS-regulon [102], has also been suggested to be involved in the SPANC balance [103]. The lacking negative effect of the rpoS knockout mutation on transcription of certain stress resistance genes might be due to direct regulation by ppGpp which is, like RpoS, present at high concentrations at low specific growth rates [104].In this study we have demonstrated that the absence of cAMP affects also different classes of genes that are necessary for surviving and growing in the environment. Interestingly, several genes found to be regulated by RpoS were also affected in the Δcya mutant, these genes belonged to all functional groups and numerous genes regulated by both global regulators in our experiments were previously reported to be under exclusive transcriptional control of RpoS. Our data confirm and extend recent suggestions that some genes are regulated by both regulators [38]. Weber and co-workers [37] have shown in a promoter analysis of ΔrpoS transcriptome data that about one half of all RpoS-regulated genes also possess a hypothetical cAMP-CRP binding motif in the promoter region. The transcriptome data reported here can serve as a useful starting point for further analysis of the involvement of cAMP in the regulation of different genes.In summary we conclude that global regulation by cAMP-CRP, but not by RpoS is essential for growth and survival of E. coli in its natural habitats which also explains why rpoS but not cya/crp mutant strains can be isolated from the environment.']"
2019-06-25T00:00:00Z,Youth and forecasting of sustainable development pillars: An adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system approach,"['The young represent the key stakeholders and participants in all the questions that refer to SD and viability, and “has the right of a sustainable future and the right of being part of this transformational process” [56]. They play necessary active role in the adequate decision making processes that relate to integration of all SDGs as well as to each individual SD pillar–economic, social and environmental [57–60]. Therefore, the opinion of young people must be taken into consideration as a necessary element of SD, since their involvement in the matters of sustainability is important for more successful and better functioning of every society [4]. This also points out to the fact that all research that refer to the question of young people and SD contributes to necessary body of knowledge of this crucial issue, having in mind that: “The creativity, ideals and courage of the youth of the world should be mobilized to forge a global partnership in order to achieve sustainable development and ensure a better future for all” [3].Furthermore, to our knowledge an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System–ANFIS has never been applied for forecasting of all three pillars of SD [25–32].The research was carried out on a representative sample of young people of Serbia consisting of 386 respondents, out of which 300 was used as a training set, and the remaining 86 for testing the model.The obtained results included not only the ranking of the importance of SDGs (End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture–rank 1; Ensure access to water and sanitation for all–rank 2; Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all ages–rank 3) but also the predictions with the satisfying accuracy of all three SD pillars (environmental, social, economic): with marks 4.20, 4.121, and 3.94 respectively, and the relative error of < 5%.This study clearly indicates that the applied ANFIS method based on ‘only’ four input variables (gender, age of respondents, current status of education and type of settlement) provides an acceptable predictions of SDG importance. Optimization of the input and output parameters, questionnaire and adequate selection of the research sample, is capable of providing sufficiently good forecasting of the three pillars of SD.Such predictions cannot replace the discussion with the young, but can help steering the discussion in directions that are important to the young people in question. By knowing and understanding what is important to the youth, we can gain their trust and achieve better collaboration in creating SD policies. To our knowledge this is the first application of ANFIS method in forecasting the importance of SDGs from demographic data. Nevertheless, we have to be aware that the ground truth can change in time, a phenomenon that in machine learning is called a concept drift, that is why we should keep updating the model in order not to miss an important change.In the end, we can draw a conclusion that ANFIS model applied in our study can be used in future research (with the increase in the number of respondents and larger training set, as well as with the application of other methods of artificial intelligence and comparative analysis of obtained results and different normalization methods for input variables) in the development of youth policies, local action and environmental plans, and adequate application and development of national strategies and SD policies.']"
2015-05-26T00:00:00Z,A Quantitative Analysis of Growth and Size Regulation in Manduca sexta: The Physiological Basis of Variation in Size and Age at Metamorphosis,"['Our analysis of the growth kinetics of Manduca has revealed several interesting and some surprising features of the regulation of body size and development time that are likely to be widespread among insects, and that raise a number of questions for future research. One question is what causes the progressive increase in the size increment at each molt? The observation implies that the mechanism that triggers a molt scales allometrically with body size. In Manduca the molt is triggered by an oxygen insufficiency imposed by a tracheal system that only grows when a larva molts but stays constant during the intermolt period when somatic growth takes place [17]. Perhaps the mean length or the volume of the tracheal system scales allometrically with body mass. Another question is what causes the decline in the specific growth rate, and why does it converge to approximately the same low value at all temperatures? Perhaps a fully grown larva has a characteristic mix of tissues with different metabolic rates that is independent of previous growth.What controls development time? From a physiological perspective development time is an emergent property. This is because molting and metamorphosis are triggered by size, not by time. Fast growing larvae simply take less time to reach the species-characteristic size than do slow growing ones. Thus the only ways to alter development time is to alter the growth rate or the size-assessment mechanism. Both the critical weight, which controls the size at which each molt will occur, and the threshold size, which controls when metamorphosis will occur, can be altered by selection on body size or development time (this paper and [21]). But we showed here that in very slow-growing larvae the size-dependent mechanism does not operate (see also [17,35]), but larvae molt on a time schedule. This could be a safety mechanism that allows a larva to grow and molt under nutritional stress, much like the bail-out response of Drosophila [44]. Non-size-dependent molts occur after about 7 days. Since a molt is stimulated by secretion of the molting hormone, ecdysone [45], this raises the question of how time-dependent ecdysone secretion is controlled.Perhaps the most intriguing question is what constitutes the threshold size? Threshold size is the ultimate cause of body size, because it determines, indirectly, at what size growth will stop. We define threshold size operationally as the size (which can be measured as mass or head capsule width [19,20]) at the beginning of an instar that determines whether the larva is in the last instar. But this operational way of finding threshold size says nothing about what exactly the larva itself is measuring that correlates so well with mass. The intriguing problem is that threshold size, unlike the critical weight, is not, as far as we can determine, a relative measure. Threshold size in effect determines the species-characteristic body size, which is an absolute measure. Selection on body size can alter threshold size (Fig 4), so there is genetic variability in the mechanism that controls threshold. The comparative study of genetic strains with different threshold sizes may allow us to unravel the molecular and physiological mechanisms of threshold size.']"

Many newborn deaths could be prevented with facility-based interventions such as neonatal resuscitation, hygienic practices, and thermal care around the time of birth for all neonates, as well as antenatal steroids and Kangaroo Mother Care for preterm babies. Since more than half of maternal deaths in sub-Saharan Africa are due to obstetric complications, it is critical to ensure that women with life-threatening complications can access the emergency obstetric care that can save their life and that of their baby.\n\n3. Consideration of Local Data and Different Health System Settings Is Necessary to Identify High-Impact, Short-Term Opportunities That Are Appropriate and Feasible for Given Health System Environments\nWhile much is known about interventions that can save lives, there are still unanswered questions regarding the “who” and “how to” around optimal service delivery strategies, providing care to families close to home, and reaching hard-to-serve populations. There is a gap in the use of local and representative data to inform policy, practice, and research priorities. There is also an urgent need to strengthen and disseminate existing tools such as LiST to assist governments and policy makers, including at the local level, in setting priorities and targets. Once evidence-based priority interventions are identified, it is necessary to link these interventions to policy as well as to address implementation challenges. There are a number of immediate opportunities available even in the lowest resource settings; however, a shortage of qualified health workers is a major constraint for improving essential health care in sub-Saharan Africa [46]. This is true both in direct service provision as well as in lack of public health champions to lead the way towards policy change [47]. More health systems research is needed on optimum delivery strategies for specific interventions and health care packages given existing constraints, and on how to increase coverage with existing packages within individual countries [19].\nDespite often negative publicity, some African countries are making progress towards saving the lives of mothers, newborns, and children. Even more lives can be saved if countries use local data to identify priority interventions and increase coverage and quality in the short term. Local and national governments and policy makers should be encouraged to use science to inform effective action to save the lives of sub-Saharan Africa's mothers, newborns, and children.\n""]"
2018-03-29T00:00:00Z,"Home range utilization by chacma baboon (Papio ursinus) troops on Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve, South Africa","['The aim of this study was to determine the spatial utilization of baboon troops on SNR over a period of 12 months. Baboon ecology theory states that baboons exhibit intra-population variation in home range size and ranging patterns, which our study supports. Although our study population falls within reported ranges for troop sizes and densities and was consistent in terms of expected variation across troops, SNR baboons appear to have larger home range sizes when compared to average home range sizes of baboons in South Africa. Core range overlap between troops was more pronounced during the cold/dry season supporting the suggestion that when resources are limited, home ranges are more likely to overlap between troops. Troop overlap during the cold/dry season may be in response to patchy resource availability, but this requires further investigation. With the exception of the troop that spent most of its time outside SNR, troop size did not influence the range size of the troops in our study.In summary we found that the home range size of chacma baboon troops on SNR were not significantly influenced by troop size, but that daily distances a troop travelled, especially within the cold/dry season, was significantly influenced by troop size. Having a spatial representation of baboon troop home ranges within the SNR provides a foundation for further studies into the quantification of available resources food, water and availability of sleeping sites within identified home ranges. Information generated from this study can be used to develop a formal baboon management plan by SNR conservation managers to assist them in reducing human-baboon conflict, it also provides the basis for further research on this population of baboons. We suggest that management consider incorporating the information on baboon home ranges generated from our study into future tourist infrastructure planning endeavors such as the placement of picnic sites, camping sites or lodges. By avoiding the placement of tourist facilities in areas of high baboon activity, management can assist in reducing potential human-baboon conflict. In addition, our study identifies the troops that incorporate areas outside of the reserve into their home ranges. This information can be used as baseline information when planning mitigation strategies for communicating with farmers and other land owners who are affected by raiding baboons. Policies on how to deal with human-baboon conflict, possible non-lethal deterrent methods and problem individual baboons need to be developed. As this reserve resembles an island and baboons are not readily able to migrate to populations outside of the reserve, monitoring numbers and resource utilisation is essential.Suggestions for future research:\nQuantify the availability of the different plant communities on the reserve to the baboon troops and incorporate this information into the home ranges of the different troops\nQuantify the resources available to baboons in the various plant communities and determine the diet of baboons on Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve\nDetermine and quantify the resources that baboons utilize outside of the reserve.\nAs Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve is in essence an island surrounded by increasing human development, the closest free-living baboon populations need to be identified and assessed to determine whether natural dispersal between these populations can still potentially occur.\nInvestigate the effectiveness of non-lethal deterrents such as bear bangers, virtual fences and so forth to reduce human-baboon conflict on and around the reserve.\n']"
2012-07-03T00:00:00Z,"“Big Food,” the Consumer Food Environment, Health, and the Policy Response in South Africa","[""The combined processes of rapid urbanisation, concentration of ownership of food production and distribution, and globalisation of food trade have resulted in rapid changes in the South African food environment. This article has focused on Big Food and attempted to bring together what is known about large food corporations in South Africa in the context of concerns about unhealthy eating and associated ill health. Although it provides an incomplete picture, it yields the following observations about Big Food in South Africa:\n        \n          It has strong similarities with Big Food in other jurisdictions: it's big, it's getting more widespread, and it's implicated in unhealthy eating.\n        \n        \n          It consists of large packaged food and soft drink manufacturers, large retailers, and food outlets. These different components of Big Food are linked through various pathways. While “small food” remains significant in the food environment in South Africa, it is both linked with, and threatened by, Big Food.\n        \n        \n          It involves both “foreign” transnationals and South African companies. Many of the South African Big Food companies, particularly the supermarket chains, have invested in other African nations and around the world. This suggests that South African Big Food may become a more important global player in years to come and that global attention on Big Food should focus both on companies whose headquarters are in North America and Europe and on companies whose headquarters are in developing nations.\n        \n        \n          Supermarkets must not be forgotten as a key component of Big Food in South Africa, where they constitute a major sales channel for the products produced by food manufacturers.\n        \n        \n          Big Food in South Africa is increasingly developing “health and wellness” initiatives. The outcome of these initiatives is not yet clear: they may have a net positive impact but if they offset more rigorous government action they may have a net negative impact.\n        \n      It is clear that urgent action is required to mitigate the adverse health effects of the changing food environment in South Africa. We suggest that this action should include a combination of accelerated efforts to educate the public about the adverse consequences of consuming easily available but unhealthy foods and greater regulation of Big Food and the strategies it employs to increase the availability, affordability, and acceptability of foods associated with unhealthy diets. The policy response to Big Food should also recognise the role of local and possibly subcontinental governance (e.g., the Southern Africa Development Community governments) in addressing the issue.In conclusion, we suggest that the South African government should develop a plan to make healthy foods such as fruit, vegetables, and whole grain cereals more available, affordable, and acceptable, and non-essential, high-calorie, nutrient-poor products, including soft drinks, some packaged foods and snacks, less available, more costly, and less appealing to the South African population. Some of these approaches may require engagement with Big Food. But elsewhere, clear rules and regulations are needed. Discussions about the regulation of promotional activities and about imposing taxes on unhealthy food products would be a good place to start.""]"
2019-04-02T00:00:00Z,Knowledge and perceptions of type 2 diabetes among Ghanaian migrants in three European countries and Ghanaians in rural and urban Ghana: The RODAM qualitative study,"['This study had a major limitation: we did not get the planned number of participants in London and Amsterdam due chiefly to structural challenges. Aspects of the challenges we experienced have been reported in the literature on accessing minority ethnic participants in social and public health research [36]. We did not achieve meaning saturation with migrant groups and reported insights should therefore be generalised with caution.However, the challenges experienced during participant recruitment for FGDs shaped creative responses–such as targeting ‘strong groups’ of friends or church members—that present methodological insights for future studies with similar migrant communities. The challenges also emphasised the importance of using mixed qualitative methods in maximising access to, and engagement with, research participants.More broadly, by employing a theory-driven, multi-site, multi-experiential qualitative approach, the study has identified patterns of T2D perceptions and knowledge across Ghanaian and European locations and age groups that can inform appropriate interventions. This study supports insights from previous studies and adds new insights to the literature. First, our research participants like other African and African migrant communities draw on eclectic theories and sources of information in making sense of T2D. Secondly, while there is general awareness of the public health importance of T2D, complications arising from T2D, and strategies for reducing risk and complications, knowledge is not comprehensive and some misperceptions and misunderstandings exist. In terms of new insights, the study shows that psychosocial theories are multi-level and nuanced and core cultural theories are challenged by some community members. We also focus on an understudied community–migrant Ghanaians in Europe–and present a systematic examination of how their knowledge of T2D is shaped by enculturation processes. This supports the development of interventions that blend existing public health strategies targeting majority European populations with specific culturally congruent adjustments for minority ethnic groups.Education and lifestyle interventions must emphasise the themes that are already known to lay communities: these include poor diets, alcohol overconsumption, smoking, physical inactivity, overweight/obesity and psychosocial stress. Education strategies must also demystify supernatural causal theories of diabetes, without delegitimizing productive aspects of religious responses to illness. For example, prayer provides important, and empirically proven, spiritual and psychosocial benefits to religious individuals [37]. Public health education is more likely to be successful if accessible and culturally congruent social channels are used for dissemination. In both rural and urban Ghana and the European cities, our empirical data suggests that collaboration between formal healthcare systems and faith-based organizations can create credible and potentially cost-effective sources of disseminating T2D information, screening and providing advice and support for T2D care. Messaging through T2D advocacy groups is also likely to have a positive impact as people with T2D are a credible source of information for lay individuals. In the European cities, health websites and social media health platforms can serve as important channels for diabetes education, particularly among younger Ghanaians.']"
2019-03-06T00:00:00Z,"A mass sacrifice of children and camelids at the Huanchaquito-Las Llamas site, Moche Valley, Peru","['The archaeological context and osteological analysis of the human and camelid remains at Huanchaquito document a mass sacrifice of children and camelids on a scale unlike any seen previously in Andean South America. In number, it greatly exceeds the known sample of Inca child sacrifices from high altitude sites in the Andes [3, 38, 40]. It also is substantially larger than the only other mass sacrifice of children known from the New World, that of 42 children in Offering 48 at the Mexica Templo Mayor in Central Mexico [36]. Relatively few convincing examples of child sacrifice are known from the Old World [100], and in most cases, there is debate over whether these in fact can be identified as intentional killing, given a lack of osteological evidence of cause of death [30, 101]. In the case of HLL, there is no such ambiguity. Skeletal evidence clearly indicates that the children and camelids were sacrificed by cutting open the thoracic cavity. No other evidence of perimortem (occurring at or around the time of death) trauma was observed in any of the children or camelids, indicating that the sacrificial program was a consistent one. Although human sacrifice by opening the thoracic cavity has been documented previously at north coast Peruvian sites, the specific technique used at Huanchaquito is unlike that of previously documented cases in Peru. Three adult skeletons found in direct association with the children and camelids also appear to be sacrifices, based on their atypical burial positions (crouched face down or splayed on the back), evidence of blunt force trauma in the two females, and a lack of funerary offerings, as well as their close physical association with the child and camelid burials, although their chests were not opened.Variation in forms of cranial deformation and the wide range of carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios observed in the children suggest that they are a heterogeneous sample, perhaps composed of individuals selected from various geographic or ethnic groups, rather than from a single local population, similar to what has been found in Inca child sacrifices [4, 38, 42–43]. The geographic origins and life histories of the HLL children, who range from approximately five to fourteen years of age, is a question to be explored further through ongoing laboratory analyses, including the study of additional stable isotopes (to examine diet and geographic origin), aDNA (to determine sex and possible genetic relationships with other coastal and highland groups), and through analysis of skeletal indicators of health and cultural markers such as intentional cranial modification. The presence of a thick layer of mud on top of the sand in which the children and camelids were buried, as well as the presence of human and animal footprints made while the mud was still wet, suggest that the sacrificial event occurred shortly after heavy rainfall and flooding, in an arid region that receives negligible rainfall under normal conditions. While the correlation between heavy rains and the sacrifice may be coincidental, it is tempting to hypothesize that the two events are associated, and that the mass offering of children and camelids may have been an attempt to appease the gods and mitigate the effects of a major ENSO event that occurred around 1400–1450 A.D. The sacrifice of such a large number of children and camelids constituted a significant investment of resources for the Chimú state, whose massive capital city Chan Chan lies less than a kilometer away from the Huanchaquito Las Llamas sacrifice site.']"
2017-08-02T00:00:00Z,"The origin of the Acheulean. Techno-functional study of the FLK W lithic record (Olduvai, Tanzania)","['Climatic and biological changes that occurred shortly before, or coincident with, the Acheulean emergence might have enabled it. This technological change may thus be understood as part of a major adjustment in the economic structure that some groups of hominins, with modern human-like hands [48], employed to adapt to a new ecological scenario. According to the production processes identified here, the earliest Acheulean economy involved diversified functional situations in which tasks with variable durations were carried out to transform resources with different resistances. The exploitation of large and resistant resources suggest that the main economic mechanism that governed the emergence of the Acheulean toolkit is an increase in the demand of work load. The results of a current experimental study strengthen this conclusion [47]. The new Acheuelan tools were designed for this purpose, extending the operating scope of the hominin’s toolkit in terms of cutting efficiency, force application, activity duration, materials to transform and tasks to perform. The technological change would be able to satisfy this demand in order to carry out new tasks and/or increase the efficiency of old tasks. In sum, the most important outcomes of the Acheulean emergence seems to be: diet diversification, novel feeding patterns, more effective acquisition and/or consumption of food resources, and novel food processing technology and extractive tools.The decision processes underlying the production of the earliest Acheulean tools have an evident functional character. The elements of design form in handaxes (i.e. tool elongation, support for working edge, lateral extension and thickness adjustment, according to [75]) are present in the best-shaped tools at FLK W, but nevertheless are poorly standardized. According to Chevrier (see page 730 in [4], this may respond to a phenomenon of invention in which design (volumetric construction) was subordinated to functional parameters rather than structured plan forms. Astonishingly, in this primitive stage, the iconic handaxe design form was conceptually and technological defined. If we accept that KS4 and KGA6-A1 are “significantly” older than FLK W, this iconic design would have been achieved in <100 Ky. Be that as it may, in the light of the current evidence, its development was not as gradual as previously thought [2, 5, 21]. In our opinion, the question is not whether there was an evolution in the Acheulean towards more refined and symmetrical handaxes, the point is why sophisticated handaxes are so rare during the early Acheulean and then become more common [19–20].We would like to conclude this paper by highlighting the huge potential that mechanical and ergonomic investigation has in our understanding of hominin techno-economic behavior [28]. Specifically, it is of great interest for the Oldowan-Acheulean gradient, since it has the potential to explain why tool sizes and shapes varied within and between assemblages. On the basis of an original techno-functional approach we have provided a complete description of the origin of the Acheulean tools in order to reach the economic mechanisms that may trigger such remarkable changes in hominin technological behavior. Future experiments are needed to investigate tool functioning with large and heavy cutting tools further, especially to explore the relationships between edge form, mass, action and TFD. All in all, we have tried to place the focus of the Oldowan-Acheulean gradient on the emerging economy rather than on the emergence of iconic morphotypes.']"
2018-10-17T00:00:00Z,Mule deer impede Pando’s recovery: Implications for aspen resilience from a single-genotype forest,"['This first comprehensive assessment of conditions at the famed Pando aspen clone reveals an ancient forest threatened by recent human decisions. A vital lesson derived from this study is that independently managing vegetation and wildlife may harm both. While several human alterations to this forest have taken place in recent decades, it is the lack of simultaneous herbivore regulation that has caused this stand’s degeneration. Here and previously [23] we have documented some successes with experimental treatments combined with post-treatment browse protection that show promise for Pando’s outlook. Through these tests and our aerial photo documentation of 1987–88 failed cutting experiments, it is clear that both passive and active management cannot be successful without mitigating herbivory. Positive results within the 2013 fence unfortunately contrast with continuing recruitment failures outside the fence, as well as within the 2014 fence. The majority of this giant clone remains either insufficiently protected via a penetrable fence or totally unguarded from herbivory; both instances are expected to yield a greatly reduced clone and cascading effects to obligate species [1,53–55]. Moreover, we highlight that post-disturbance stable-type aspen forests such as Pando require a complex vertical stand structure for system resilience [13,31–32]. Even where a 25-year-old clearfell and fence yielded advanced recruitment today, no successful reproduction since that time presents significant concerns. Greater vigilance will be required in future forest-herbivory management via deer and cattle exclusion, increased animal movement, or population reductions if we wish to see a rebounding and resilient Pando clone.This spatially confined study on a genetically uniform aspen forest in Utah has broad ramifications for aspen management at-large; the issues found here are mirrored across the ranges of the most widespread tree species in the world (i.e., P. tremuloides, P. tremula; [3,48–49,55–56]). As we begin to understand growth and defense mechanisms linked to genotype, there is potential for altering aspen-herbivore strategies accordingly. We may use this relatively simple system, which is still an entire forest, as a building block for understanding and mitigation of herbivore impacts at larger scales in multiple-clone landscapes with greater diversity of defense chemistry allocation. Likewise, experimental tradeoffs between nutrition, defense, growth, and response to disturbance may be compared to this iconic clone as a starting point for understanding long-term survival of aspen communities under duress.While conservation efforts are commonly aimed at rare species within specialized niches, a habitat approach affecting a broad array of aspen-obligates at continental-scales may be a more effective strategy for preserving greater overall biotic integrity. Impacts of overabundant wild ungulates are often overlooked by preservationists, policymakers, and the public because of their perceived benign effects [56]. What many conservation efforts have failed to implement thus far are coordinated strategies of forest-herbivore stewardship, particularly at regional and multinational scales [3,13,57]. Such approaches not only promote ecological, process-based, landscape management, they have the added benefit of clearly linking human decision-making to cascading ecological consequences. There should be no confusion over the point that both domestic and wild herbivore populations are governed by people’s preferences and actions, and that those decisions result in long-term consequences for ecosystems writ large.']"
2014-08-14T00:00:00Z,Schistosome Feeding and Regurgitation,"['Due to their importance as agents of disease morbidity, schistosomes are the most widely researched parasitic flatworms and quite possibly helminths in general. The habitat of adult worms in the bloodstream provides a perpetual and rich source of nutrients. Earlier research on parasite composition emphasised the sheer scale of the feeding process, especially in the female worm. More recent studies have highlighted the mechanisms which mediate this process; a synopsis both of current knowledge and areas of uncertainty is provided in Box 1 and Figure 4. Our contention is that the success of schistosomes as pathogens can be attributed in part to the unique and complementary balance between active feeding via the alimentary tract and nutrient uptake across the body surface.10.1371/journal.ppat.1004246.g004Figure 4\nPathways for diffusion of nutrients in male and female schistosomes.\nConfocal images of stained adult male (left) and female (right) schistosome cross sections at the same magnification (yellow, phalloidin for actin; blue, DAPI for nuclei; green, tegument and gut). The parameter values are the mean of 12 females and 11 males in near perfect cross section. Areas and distances were measured using the polygon line and path tools in the Analyzing Digital Images package from the Lawrence Hall of Science, Berkeley, California (http://www.globalsystemsscience.org/software/download). Solid white arrows show diffusion distances from the tegument surface to the midpoint, dotted white arrows those from the gut lumen to the furthest extremity. The gut lumen of the female occupies 9.7% of the cross section, that of the male only 1.9%. Nutrients diffusing from the male gut would have to travel >400 µm to reach the furthest tissues whereas the maximum distance from the female gut is only 85 µm. The distance a nutrient has to diffuse from the tegument surface to the tissue midpoint in both male and female is very similar at ∼40 µm. Central boxes list metabolite classes that are transported across the tegument (upper box, yellow arrows) or via the gastrointestinal tract (lower box, yellow arrows). Metabolites that have been shown experimentally to be transported are listed in the upper group in each box. Those that have been inferred to be transported from proteomic, transcriptomic, or other work are indicated by italics.\n\nBox 1. A Synopsis\nBody shape: The disparity between the dorso-ventrally flattened male and the almost cylindrical female (Figure 4) undoubtedly has a marked influence on their respective metabolic predispositions. The physical constraints imposed on the diffusion of small molecules through tissues must favour the tegument as the predominant site of nutrient uptake in males, whereas an even balance between gut and tegument is more likely in females.\nThe tegument and gut epithelia: Neither the pitted, sponge-like tegument nor the gastrodermis with its surface lamellae are typical of the solute-absorbing, microvillus-bearing surfaces found in the tissues of higher animals. This must reflect the ancient evolutionary origins of the schistosomes, with a triploblastic but acoelomate body plan, so novel aspects of nutrient uptake might be anticipated. Secretion of lysosomal enzymes into a gut lumen that operates at <pH 5.0 is one example.\nThe feeding cycle: Another male/female disparity is the size of the oral/esophageal pump relative to the blood consumed. The pump in the female is only one-fifth the size of that in the male but must move 8.5 times the volume of blood, so needs to work 40 times as hard. This makes it highly likely that females feed continuously, with short interruptions for regurgitation of hemozoin, whereas males feed intermittently (the male cannot ingest blood while using its oral sucker to transport a female along blood vessels). A feeding/digestion/regurgitation cycle in males would explain why they come in various shades of brown while females are more uniformly black.\nEsophageal gland function: The demonstration that the esophageal gland plays a central role in blood processing has added an extra dimension to schistosome nutrition. A small number of products has already been identified, but characterisation of the secretions and definition of the roles of individual proteins presents a major challenge. How erythrocytes are lysed, leucocytes are trapped and damaged, yet blood coagulation does not block the esophagus are the principal questions to be tackled.\nWater-salt balance: Worm bodies do not become bloated as they feed, so the ingested plasma fluids (water and salts) must be continuously expelled—in the female, the equivalent of 4.4 body volumes per day. Since vomitus is a thin and infrequent trickle, regurgitation can only play a minimal role. That leaves the protonephridial system, which ramifies through internal tissues but is poorly understood, or the tegument, where aquaporin is very abundant in the surface membranes. As lactate is expelled via aquaporin pores [65], excess water may travel the same route, and the Na/K pump in the tegument membranes is also likely involved. The 8-fold disparity in plasma fluid intake means that the female has a much greater task than the male, and this must represent a significant metabolic burden.\nAmino acids and proteins: No quantitative estimates of amino acid uptake by medium depletion are available to compare with those for glucose. However, amino acid transporters are present in the tegument surface and may be especially important in male tissues distant from the gut (Figure 4). Nevertheless, in the female the amount of blood protein ingested (4.5 times dry weight), coupled with shorter diffusion distances, likely make it the dominant source. Undoubtedly this reflects the much greater exported biomass of eggs from females (∼300 per day in S. mansoni, ∼2000 in S. japonicum) compared to that of sperm produced by males. The current paucity of information on the gastrodermal transcriptome and proteome is an obstacle to understanding gut function. The recent paper on schistosome organ isolation may provide a way forward [66].\nCarbohydrates and energy metabolism: The tegument is clearly the predominant route of glucose uptake for ATP generation in both sexes. A minor transport component is possible via the gut, involving special sugars (e.g., for glycan synthesis). It is notable that females take up less glucose but ingest greater amounts of amino acids (as protein) than males. The possibility that the amino acid carbon skeleton is used in females for ATP generation has not been explored, although the requisite transaminases and aminotransferases are encoded in the genome.\nLipids: Despite some effort, there is no significant evidence for uptake of essential lipids across the tegument, so we must assume the gut is the dominant route in both sexes; indeed, the presence of the membranocalyx may preclude lipid entry to the tegument. The multiplicity of saposins in the gut lumen, plus the Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) cholesterol transporter homolog reinforces this conclusion. Lipid droplet transcytosis across gut epithelium is a possibility, but has not yet been demonstrated by feeding experiments, as performed with dextran.\nEpilogue: Once established in the bloodstream, schistosomes are hard to eliminate. The tegument and alimentary tract are the principal interfaces with the host so a better understanding of the functions they perform should provide avenues for more effective interventions. Is there scope for new diagnostic markers among the gut secretions expelled in vomitus? Are the transport proteins in both tegument and gut membranes suitable targets for pharmaceutical intervention? Do the esophageal gland secretions represent a novel cohort of vaccine candidates that can be targeted to disrupt blood feeding? Are females, with their greater nutritional requirements, more susceptible targets than males, a feature that would reduce transmission?\n']"
2012-10-17T00:00:00Z,Evaluation of 14 Organic Solvents and Carriers for Screening Applications in Zebrafish Embryos and Larvae,"['While limited in scope, this toxicity screen has revealed several solvents – in addition to DMSO – that appear to have potential utility for zebrafish bioassays. Based on these initial data, polyethylene glycol (PEG-400), propylene glycol, and methanol in particular appear to be attractive solvents to deliver compounds to both embryos and larvae. In addition, acetone appears suitable for embryos. In terms of carriers, albumin (BSA) appears useful for older larvae, and cyclodextrin (HPBCD) for both embryos and larvae, albeit only up to 1% final concentration.Several caveats will apply in the direct extension of these results to other laboratories. Appreciable differences have been observed between zebrafish strains with respect to the embryotoxic effects of ethanol [42], for example. The MTCs observed in this study, which relied on ABs, should therefore not be extrapolated to other strains such as Tübingen, TL and WIK without further experimental confirmation. Furthermore, uncharacterized environmental factors such as the water quality, diet, and stress levels experienced by adult zebrafish in different aquaculture facilities may directly or indirectly influence the sensitivity of their offspring to various chemicals such as those evalulated here. Finally, differences in the purity of solvents and carriers could influence results, depending on the grade that is used (p.a. grade solvents were used for this study). For these reasons, an initial dose-finding experiment should ideally be performed for each new solvent and carrier used by laboratories for exposing zebrafish embryos and larvae to compounds.This study was designed to identify solvent and carriers – in addition to DMSO, which is already widely used – that might be useful in delivering small molecules to zebrafish embryos and larvae. While we were able to find apparently safe concentrations for several solvents and carriers, it is likely that these concentrations are, on their own, bioactive and therefore potentially influencing pharmacological or toxicological screens being carried out using these solvents or carriers. In general, given the relatively small differences (2–3 fold) between concentrations that are apparently safe and those that are clearly toxic, further studies – e.g. omics analyses – should be carried out to determine which cellular processes and signalling pathways are affected by any solvents and carriers that are used for small-molecule screens in zebrafish. It is interesting to note that increased hsp70 levels can be observed in zebrafish embryos and larvae exposed to sub-toxic levels of DMSO, indicating that these concentrations are capable of inducing stress reponses [43]. More recently, microarray analysis of zebrafish embryos exposed for 48 hours to low levels of DMSO revealed the differential expression of large numbers of transcripts [44], and another study detected effects on locomotor activity and behavior in DMSO-treated larvae [45]. Future studies should therefore be carried out to examine the global changes in the transcriptome and phosphoproteome of embryos and larvae treated with apparently safe concentrations of DMSO, as well as with other solvents and carriers evaluated in this study, to better understand the potential of this level of exposure to influence the bioactivity of compounds being tested. In any case, bioactivity results for individual compounds in zebrafish-based pharmacological or toxicological screens should therefore be interpreted together with the caveat that the solvent or carrier used to deliver these compounds may have influenced these results based on their own bioactivity, and that negative controls (with this solvent or carrier only) may not be sufficient to control for these effects. One solution to this problem would be to confirm the bioactivity of compounds using additional solvents or carriers for their delivery.']"
2014-01-23T00:00:00Z,Acute High Fat Diet Consumption Activates the Mesolimbic Circuit and Requires Orexin Signaling in a Mouse Model,"['In the current study we provide evidence that acute HFD consumption recruits centers of the mesolimbic pathway including neurons of the VTA, NAc, CeA and LHA. Remarkably, we found different responsiveness of PBP, PN and IF sub-regions of the VTA to acute HFD consumption. In terms of the neuronal circuit recruited by acute HFD, we show that orexin signaling is necessary for the spontaneous consumption of HFD and for the HFD-induced activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system. In support of this possibility, we show that HFD-responsive orexin neurons of the LHA innervate the VTA.Current findings support the notion that brain circuits driving motivation to consume a palatable food are a powerful system that can override homeostatic signals [4]. In our experimental test, mice exposed to a HFD pellet spontaneously consumed ∼1.22 kcal, which represents nearly a fifth of their daily food intake, in a short period of time. Of note, satiated mice were exposed to HFD at a time of the day when spontaneous food intake is minimal and while they remained with free access to RC. Thus, this spontaneous consumption of HFD appears to be mainly due to the palatable nature of the stimulus and involve hedonic aspects of eating. In support of this possibility, we observed a strong activation of different nuclei of the mesolimbic system. Importantly, acute HFD resulted in the same profile of c-Fos activation in the mesolimbic pathway in mice that had been previously exposed 2 h to HFD in the previous day (data not shown). Thus, neophobia (i.e. aversion to approach a novel stimulus) or novelty seeking (i.e. enhanced specific exploration of a novel stimulus) seems to play a minor role in our observations. This could be due to the minimal differences in the overall appearance of the HFD and RC pellets. Also, HFD and RC pellets were prepared with the same ingredients though in different proportion. We cannot completely rule out that some degree of neophobia exists in our experimental paradigm. However, the large amount of food intake in HFD-ad lib group and the lack of activation of brain nuclei known to be activated in response to a novel gustatory stimulus [34] suggest that neophobia, if present at all, is transient and minimal. Thus, we propose that the current behavioral test is a suitable model to investigate the neuronal circuits and molecular mechanisms regulating hedonic-related eating behaviors.It is interesting to stress that we included an experimental group consisting of mice exposed to an amount of HFD weight similar to that eaten by control mice exposed to RC. This HFD-pair-fed group was used to distinguish potential effects of the HFD itself from those of higher food intake. Although RC and HFD were not isocaloric, the amount of calories consumed by HFD-pair-fed and control mice were statistically indistinguishable. Thus, HFD-pair-fed and control mice consumed similar amounts of food, expressed either as food weight or calories. HFD ad lib and HFD-pair-fed groups showed similar acute HFD-induced activation of most neuronal populations of the mesolimbic pathway, with the exception of the IF neurons of the VTA that were not activated in the HFD-pair-fed group (see below). Thus, it seems that the acute activation of the mesolimbic pathway is mainly mediated by the HFD itself, rather than the eaten weight or the caloric content.We show that HFD-mediated orosensory stimulation is required for the mesolimbic pathway activation since intragastric administration of HFD failed to increase c-Fos in most of the brain areas under study. Recent studies suggest that dietary fat sensing would involve fatty acid receptors located in the tongue [35]. Then, orosensory taste information is transmitted to the NTS, which directly or indirectly recruits neuronal nuclei in the hindbrain (i.e. PBN), midbrain (i.e. VTA) and forebrain (i.e. NAc and LHA) [36], [37]. Thus, it is possible to hypothesize that the HFD-mediated orosensory stimulation due to the high levels of fatty acids present in the diet, results in the activation of neuronal circuits that end up recruiting the mesolimbic pathway. Post-oral effects of HFD have been proposed to result in overconsumption because fat is less satiating than other macronutrients [38]. In addition, it has been shown that the rewarding value of HFD is determined by its post-oral nutritive effects [39]. Current data stress the importance of the HFD-induced oral stimulation in the acute activation of the mesolimbic pathway, but it does not refute post-ingestion effects of HFD on its rewarding value. One intrinsic limitation of intragastric gavage is that it may cause unusual gastric distention and change the dynamics of nutrient entry to the intestine. In addition, stress associated to the animals handling may mask physiological responses to nutrients. However, this experimental strategy is a valuable tool to dissociate the impact of oral and post-oral signals as demonstrated by previous studies showing that intragastric infusions of glucose can stimulate dopamine system, independently of oral stimulation [40], [41].Here we show that VTA dopamine neurons are significantly activated in HFD-exposed mice. The initial site of action for addictive drugs is known to be predominantly the VTA neurons of the mesolimbic circuit, which then influences many behaviors related to drug addiction [11]. In contrast, the role of VTA neurons in hedonic-driven food consumption is still a matter of debate [10], [13], [14]. It has been proposed that VTA dopamine neurons are responsive to pleasurable foods, or cues that predict it, and also able to promote behaviors directed towards food consumption [5], [42]. VTA contains multiple anatomically and functionally diverse sub-regions [8], [9], [31], [32], [43]. Here we have analyzed c-Fos expression within the VTA sub-regions where dopamine neurons are enriched [8] and found a differential response to the spontaneous HFD consumption. In particular, acute HFD caused a significant activation of dopamine neurons of the PN and PBP sub-divisions independently of the amount of HFD ingested. In contrast, activation of dopamine and non-dopamine neurons of the IF sub-division of the VTA occurred only in mice that over-consumed HFD and the degree of activation correlated with the amount of HFD ingested. The finding that HFD-pair-fed group showed no activation of IF neurons, regardless of their motivation for HFD eating, suggests that these neurons are responsive to the amount of HFD ingested rather than triggering its consumption. Importantly, sub-divisions of the VTA also show differences in terms of their projections and neuronal targets [8]: the PBP and PN dopamine neurons project to the ventrolateral striatum, including the lateral part of the NAc shell and NAc core, while the IF neurons selectively project to the medial part of the NAc shell. Thus, it is possible to hypothesize that sub-divisions of the VTA participate in diverse aspects of hedonic eating. Of note, sub-divisions of the VTA have been shown to respond differently to drugs of abuse, including opiates and alcohol [44]–[47].Acute HFD leads to a strong activation of LHA orexin neurons that is required for the activation of VTA neurons and the full induction of food intake. The LHA is a key brain area that integrates gustatory and visceral information and then modulates different functions, including feeding [17]–[19]. LHA Orexin neurons are involved not only in the regulation of homeostatic food intake itself but also in food reward-related behaviors, including hedonic and motivational components of eating [17]–[19], [25]. In this regard, LHA orexin neurons project to dopamine neurons of the VTA, where orexin receptors are highly expressed and orexin activates both dopamine and non-dopamine neurons [17]–[22]. Orexin signaling is relevant for hedonic eating, as suggested by the finding that orexin-1 receptor antagonism attenuates HFD consumption in rats subject to forced caloric satiation [28]. Interestingly, the hypophagic effect of orexin-1 receptor antagonism occurs exclusively on high fat diet intake and does not affect RC intake [25]–[28]. It has been hypothesized that orexin signaling selectively enhances potentiation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the VTA for highly salient appetitive reinforcers [27]. However, the reason of the specificity of orexin signaling regulating HFD intake is currently unclear. Here we show that spontaneous consumption of HFD was partially blocked in mice administered an orexin 1 receptor antagonist. Thus, we have not only confirmed previous studies but also shown that even spontaneous consumption of HFD in ad lib fed mice requires orexin signaling.Here, we also show that orexin signaling blockade reduced c-Fos induction in the VTA suggesting that orexin neurons are involved in the activation of the mesolimbic pathway. Indeed, we show that most LHA orexin neurons projecting to the VTA increased c-Fos in response to acute HFD. Thus, we conclude that acute HFD may indirectly engage the dopamine neurons of the mesolimbic system by initially targeting orexin LHA neurons which, in turn, project to the VTA. The estimations of orexin-IR fibers density and number of TH-IR neurons contacted by orexin-IR fibers within each VTA sub-region showed no differences. Thus, the mechanisms mediating the differential activation of dopamine neurons of the IF sub-region of the VTA in response to acute HFD will require further studies. Interestingly, we also found VTA innervating neurons of the LHA responsive to acute HFD that were negative for orexin-IR. These LHA non-orexin neurons responsive to HFD may include melanin-concentrating hormone-producing or also neurotensin-producing neurons, which have been shown to reinforce the consumption of calorically dense foods [48], [49]. Of note, a potential involvement of orexin signaling in the VTA mediating the acute stimulation of HFD consumption does not rule out that other neuronal targets of the orexin neurons also participate in this mechanism [22]. Indeed, orexin neurons project to other centers of the mesolimbic pathway known to mediate motivated behaviors, such as the prefrontal cortex, where orexin receptors are highly expressed [50]–[52]. Future studies, using selectively blockade of orexin 1 receptors in these orexin targets, are required in order to elucidate the circuit activated by acute HFD consumption.Acute HFD leads to an activation of NAc, independent of the orexin signaling. The NAc is strategically positioned to translate the affective assessment of food into feeding behaviors since it receives critical orosensory information and then projects to hypothalamic and midbrain areas that contribute to the motor expression of feeding [12], [16], [53]. The NAc contains two functionally different sub-regions: NAc core and NAc shell [18]. The NAc core projects to the basal ganglia pathways to influence voluntary motor functions while the NAc shell projects mainly to subcortical limbic regions, such as the LHA and VTA, and modulates hedonic behaviors [18]. The role of the NAc in feeding behaviors is complex [16], [50], [53]. It has been shown that stimulation of NAc shell neurons by µ-opiod receptor agonists can stimulate HFD consumption by recruiting LHA orexin neurons that, in turn, would activate VTA neurons [16], [50], [53]. Here we show that acute HFD activated c-Fos expression in the NAc shell and that this effect was not blocked by an orexin receptor 1 antagonist. Thus, it is possible to hypothesize that NAc shell is one of the initial neuronal targets recruited by HFD consumption that then further engages other brain systems, including the LHA and VTA neurons. In support of this possibility, it has been shown that the hyperphagia observed in response to intra-NAc shell administration of the µ-opiod receptor agonist DAMGO is blocked by temporary inactivation of the LHA and VTA [53]. Although not a central focus of the current study, we observed that acute HFD also activates c-Fos expression in the NAc core and CeA in an orexin-independent manner.Here, we have used a simple experimental paradigm in mice to provide evidence that clarify our understanding of the brain neuronal circuits recruited by the acute and spontaneous HFD consumption. Hopefully, this information will be helpful to the future development of new strategies for the treatment of conditions in which overconsumption of highly palatable food is observed. For instance, this current protocol could be used to study the neurobiology of binge-eating episodes, which refer to specific events of uncontrollable overconsumption in which the motivation to eat is usually aimed to obtain palatable energy-dense foods [54]–[56]. Episodes of binge-eating are characteristic of patients suffering from several eating disorders including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder [57]–[60]. In addition, binge-eating episodes are observed in obese patients and even in healthy people under specific circumstances, such as stress [61]. Despite its clinical relevance, finding appropriate animal models for studying binge eating episodes has been challenging due to the fact that its etiology in humans is currently unclear [62]. In order to trigger acute food overconsumption, many animal models of binge eating involve a previous period of imposed food restriction, which also affects brain circuits regulating homeostatic aspects of food intake [55], [63], [64]. However, some evidences suggest that binge-eating episodes mainly involve hedonic-related feeding circuits [65]. Here, we show that satiated mice that spontaneously consumed a large amount of HFD in a short period of time have a strong activation of the VTA-NAc-LHA pathway. Therefore, this experimental protocol may be helpful to study the eating episodes in early stages, when the mesolimbic pathway would presumably play a key role [66].']"
2018-03-01T00:00:00Z,Diagnostic tools for soil-transmitted helminths control and elimination programs: A pathway for diagnostic product development,"['The success of the current WHO STH control strategy has catalyzed interest in moving beyond coverage estimates and morbidity control to improving program efficiency and exploring the prospect of breaking the transmission of STHs to reduce resources required for sustaining vertical STH programs. These aspirations require surveys of the targeted populations, and the aim of the hypothetical use-cases was to simulate STH program decisions requiring diagnostic information. The context within these use-cases frame performance and implementation requirements for the design and evaluation of existing and new tools. This approach ensures that user needs are the destination of a research and product development road map, instead of forcing the adoption of an imperfect technology. In the best-case scenario, one technology is able meet the requirements of multiple TPPs.The current TPP for use-case #1 and #2A addresses the needs of morbidity control programs but does not address the needs of elimination programs that would initiate or continue in lower transmission settings (e.g., <20% apparent prevalence). The Kato-Katz method meets most, but not all, of the minimum criteria in this TPP, as it offers sufficient analytical and clinical sensitivity but does not meet precision and reproducibility criteria (§2.5 and 2.6), nor does it meet regulatory requirements (§3.1). New tools that meet all requirements described in this TPP are needed as one step towards strengthening STH program efficiency. Opportunities for improvement are also highlighted in Table 1, and as with any new tool, it is important to consider manufacturability, use, and cost-effectiveness from the program perspective.STH programs that aim to move beyond morbidity control towards interruption of transmission are described in use-cases #2B, #3, and #4. Tests for use-case #2B will require a lower LOD than use-case #2A, but there is insufficient information to provide definitive criteria, as this approximates the transmission breakpoint. There is a need to define the epidemiological characteristics of a transmission breakpoint to understand the risk criteria of an individual’s contribution to STH transmission within a given population. This is challenging given the wide range of contextual factors that define population heterogeneity, such as seasonality, individual health/nutritional status, environmental exposure, and/or social behaviors. These factors may influence STH transmission and thus, also, breakpoints [52]. Mathematical modeling and animal studies can approximate the extent of these potential contributions to guide definitions of phenotypic characteristics (§2.1), information necessary for defining clinical utility requirements of biomarkers. A TPP for use-case #2B and #3 diagnostics also requires proof of concept that programs can interrupt transmission in a scalable and cost-effective manner, with a strategy that verifies decision points requiring diagnostic surveys and test implementation scenarios (timing, sampling size, etc.).Diagnostic needs will adjust over time as emerging research continues to evolve program strategies. These TPPs and use-cases are living documents that capture the current trajectory of STH programs to identify gaps that can be addressed through research and product development.\n\nKey learning points\n\nThe soil-transmitted helminth (STH) community has started exploring opportunities to strengthen a control program’s ability to monitor changes in prevalence of infection, potentially to a reduction that is sustained below transmission breakpoints.\nCurrent global strategies have been successful with existing diagnostics, and more ambitious program end points would likely require different tools to evaluate the impact of population-directed interventions.\nNewly created target product profiles (TPPs) described in this article aim to direct the development and evaluation of diagnostic tools that improve the efficiency of control and elimination programs.\nThe STH community lacks a tool to confirm a break in transmission, and based on the new TPP, critical evidence to inform the development of this diagnostic is currently unavailable. Additional research is needed to define species-specific transmission breakpoints and guide the translation of individual-level test results to population-level transmission indicators.\n\n\n']"
2016-05-19T00:00:00Z,Complexities and Perplexities: A Critical Appraisal of the Evidence for Soil-Transmitted Helminth Infection-Related Morbidity,"['In this manuscript, we have found that there is a paucity of recently collected data to inform our knowledge of STH morbidity. In particular, relatively little quantifiable evidence of STH morbidity has been forthcoming in recent years. Of the evidence that has been provided, few firm conclusions can be drawn. Perhaps this, too, is a reflection of the insidiousness of STH. Alternatively, this could be partly a result of trials that are powered to measure different primary outcomes; secondary morbidity outcomes may therefore be inadequately powered for effects to be detectable. Furthermore, this may be because intervention trials are impossible to conduct over sufficient time periods to assess deworming impacts on morbidity in the manner that such programmes are delivered in real-world settings (i.e., repeated rounds administered throughout childhood). There is also a possibility that our review has applied selection criteria that could have excluded key evidence. We considered that applying these criteria was the most accurate way to differentiate between direct and indirect STH morbidity measures. The main discrepancy that the Cochrane systematic review highlights is insufficient and heterogeneous underlying evidence. This is reinforced by our own findings.We do have an evidence problem regarding STH morbidity and health effects of deworming. The use of prevalence and, to a lesser extent, intensity of infection as indicators for intervention planning, monitoring, and evaluation may have reduced the impetus to investigate more direct morbidity measures. As a consequence, we might not currently be able to prove the benefits of deworming. Furthermore, evidence of morbidity may become increasingly hard to detect over time if prevalence and intensity continue to reduce in populations. This is obviously a good outcome, but a poor basis upon which to make any assessments. Our main conclusion is that further investments in appropriately designed studies that are powered to measure changes in direct STH morbidity indicators are urgently required.\n\nKey Learning Points\n\nThere is a paucity of quantifiable evidence of STH morbidity in recent years when assessed by direct morbidity measures such as changes in height, weight, haemoglobin, and cognition.\nThe most recent Cochrane systematic review has assessed possible benefits of deworming on morbidity outcomes by pooling RCTs of deworming regardless of individual infection status, STH species, type of anthelmintic drug, and distribution strategy. In our opinion, this is methodologically inaccurate given current knowledge of STH heterogeneity. There may be insufficient evidence to prove benefits of deworming, but this is not the same as the authors’ conclusion of lack of an effect.\nCareful consideration needs to be given to use of systematic reviews of RCTs for measuring improvements in morbidity from deworming. Furthermore, there needs to be clarification of the role of observational evidence for assessing STH-associated morbidity given that not all morbidity investigations are feasible within an RCT design.\nStudies designed to detect direct morbidity from STH are urgently required to strengthen evidence for deworming.\n\n\n\nTop Five Papers\n\n1Taylor-Robinson DC, Maayan N, Soares-Weiser K, Donegan S, Garner P.

2017-01-11T00:00:00Z,Comparative Analysis of Vertebrate Diurnal/Circadian Transcriptomes,"['Despite commonalities between datasets the overlap between the same tissues from the same species display a rather small overlap [40]. One constant finding is that the overlapping group includes core clock genes [14]. This feature is often used to leverage circadian transcriptomic studies toward the identification of novel clock genes [14]. The low overlap between output networks from different studies is not in line with the assumption that billions of years of evolution must have led to a robust recurring set of oscillating outputs.Several reasons can explain this low overlap. First, all studies rely on algorithms to call rhythmic transcripts with their own inherent accuracy level. Identifying the perfect algorithm is an intense area of research and at the moment the community has not converged on a specific choice [34]. The use of different algorithms could explain a part of the low overlap. A second important factor is the sampling frequency. In order to accurately identify rhythmic genes, it was found that sampling frequency of 1 sample/hour is largely superior as compared to 1 sample per 2 or 4 hours [10]. While economic reasons often dictate the favored choice, the most common sampling frequency is 1 sample per 4 hours. This choice can lead to the identification of fewer cycling transcript with a higher ratio of false positives. Studies analyzing circadian datasets using the same algorithm also identified low overlap between dataset from different laboratories [40].The review of circadian transcriptomics studies reveals two alternative possibilities for this observed low overlap. The first one is that a large proportion, possibly all, genes are rhythmic and inappropriate sampling rate and algorithm hampers us to fully grasp the exact output network. The second alternative is that each study provides an expression of the circadian clock output network channeled by the nature of the environment in which the specimen was maintained. Variations in soil, food type, lighting, temperature, social interaction, microbiome will be incorporated in the expression of the circadian output that will be an adaptive response to the environment [3]. In this case, the observed network is exclusive to this specific environment. Depending on the conditions, some cluster of genes may be incompatible with clusters from other studies (e.g. different diets). This second alternative would better explain why there is always a substantial number of diurnall/circadian-controlled transcription factors (CCTFs) being expressed rhythmically with no clear role in the core clock mechanisms. These CCTFs may participate in an adaptive gating system controlling the output network.In order to explore the circadian output network, we use a comparative transcriptomic approach. To leverage circadian mouse liver datasets generated by the community, we selected the same organ in the vertebrate Zebrafish Danio rerio. Our study reveals that the Zebrafish liver rhythmic transcriptome is of similar size as its mammalian counterparts, with phases covering the whole spectrum with two major clusters. Comparative analyses between other Zebrafish time courses revealed tight regulation of the core clock genes and phase shift of other groups. Comparison with mouse time course also highlighted similarities between the core clock set and shifting group of output genes. Comparison with tissue datasets identified a liver identity and features associated with specific group of tissues. Comparison of TF families revealed that the lack of overlap between output genes list is nevertheless associated with a similar size array of TFs from the same family oscillating at similar times. These features help inform on the potential global nature of the vertebrate output network and confirm the potential of Zebrafish liver and larva stage as model to build upon the actual knowledge from rodent and human to better investigate the overall circadian output network.']"
2014-05-20T00:00:00Z, 1H NMR-Based Profiling Reveals Differential Immune-Metabolic Networks during Influenza Virus Infection in Obese Mice,"['Globally, 500 million adults are clinically obese, and the number of pathophysiological complications and identified health risks of excess adiposity continue to mount [2]. Although a number of innate and adaptive immune defenses are altered by obesity during influenza infection, explanatory mechanisms remain relatively undefined. Through metabolic assessment of urine and feces, we demonstrated that metabolic profiling can successfully distinguish uninfected lean and obese mice, naïve and infected mice, and lean and obese mice infected with influenza. Metabolic analysis of serum, WAT and livers also revealed differences in a variety of metabolic pathways in obese mice during the peak of influenza immune responses. Lastly, statistical relationships between T cell responses and tissue/biofluid metabolites were uncovered allowing for a thorough differential immune-metabolic characterization.Metabolic profiling of urine and feces revealed greater levels of urinary taurine, ureidopropanoate, 1-methylnicotinamide, glucose and fecal choline in uninfected obese mice. Metabolic changes detected in the urine and feces may reflect local changes in the kidneys or gastrointestinal system, as well as systemic alterations in metabolism. To our knowledge, there are currently no reports defining how influenza infection alters metabolite profiles in the urine and feces of mice. During infection, acetylcarnitine, ascorbate, glucose and 3-hydroxybutyrate were elevated in the urine of obese mice. Of interest, a variety of lipid metabolites and propionate (a short chain fatty acid) [46] were detected at greater concentrations in the feces of obese mice at 2 dpi. Because these changes were not observed prior to infection, the increased levels of these metabolites are specific to the infection in obese mice (and not simply due to diet or obesity status). This finding may yield new hypotheses related to obesity and influenza infection, such as: Are there local changes in the gastrointestinal system of obese mice during influenza that may impact infection outcome? Does obesity induce alterations in the gut microbiota during influenza, potentially impacting infection responses (propionate can be produced by gut microbiota) [46]? Further, acetylcarnitine was detected at higher levels in the urine of obese mice at 6 dpi. Acetylcarnitine is the acetylated form of carnitine, which is utilized in fatty acid transport into mitochondria for subsequent β-oxidation. Therefore, various metabolites related to lipid metabolism were significantly altered in the feces and urine of obese mice, perhaps suggesting alterations in lipid metabolism contributes to differential infection responses in obese mice. Of interest, it has been demonstrated metabolic profiling of mouse serum revealed influenza infection alone causes changes in a number of lipid metabolites [30].Ascorbate (vitamin C) was significantly higher in the urine of obese mice at 2 dpi. Excess levels of ascorbate in mice are controlled, in part, through urinary excretion [47], [48]. Unlike humans, mice have the ability to synthesize endogenous ascorbate [49], [50]. Further, during times of stress, mammals upregulate ascorbate biosynthesis [51]. Ascorbate fulfills a variety of physiological functions, including regulation of oxidative stress [50], [52]. Elevated ascorbate in the urine may be indicative of greater levels of oxidative stress in infected obese mice. Oxidative stress and vitamin C deficiency in mice can increase influenza infection pathology and mortality [50], [53], [54]. Further, influenza infection and obesity are independently associated with greater levels of oxidative stress [55], [56]. Therefore, it is likely that obesity exacerbates oxidative stress conditions during influenza infections, ultimately affecting infection outcome. Further, if vitamin C requirements are increased during infection in the obese, perhaps obese humans require greater ascorbate intake during influenza infection and should supplement during influenza seasons. It is interesting that ascorbate was detected at greater levels in the urine of obese mice, but it is unclear why elevated levels weren’t detected in the serum or the liver (primary site of synthesis). Perhaps, at 9 dpi, when serum and livers were harvested, ascorbate in obese mice returned to similar levels as in lean mice.Another interesting finding revealed by metabolic profiling was that glucose was significantly elevated in the urine of obese mice prior to infection, and at 2 and 6 dpi. Glucose intolerance often results in glucosuria [42], [57]. Further, obese mice had greater levels of glucose in the serum and liver at 9 dpi compared with lean mice. It has been extensively demonstrated that diet-induced and genetic obese mice exhibit elevated blood glucose levels [58], [59]. However, tissue and circulating glucose levels in obese mice have never been measured during the context of an influenza infection. Chronically elevated glucose can have a variety of pathological effects, including glycation products, oxidants, hyperosmolarity and perturbations in cell signaling pathways [59]. Therefore, it would be interesting to investigate influenza severity in a model in which obese mice have normalized insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance [28].In recent years, an abundance of research has focused on how metabolism is a critical regulator of immune cell function [60]. Manipulation of nutrient availability in culture or genetic manipulation of genes that regulate metabolic pathways can have a profound impact on immune activity and disease outcome [4], [60]. However, it is relatively unclear how metabolites and nutrients in the immune cell microenvironment may alter cellular metabolism, distribution and function during the context of an infection. Therefore, we took advantage of this comprehensive metabolic analysis and assessed significant interactions between T cell populations and metabolites. A number of immune-metabolic correlations were uncovered. For example, lung choline and phosphocholine were positively associated with BAL Tregs and other CD4+ T cell populations in lean mice but not in obese mice. Perhaps, perturbations in choline/phosphocholine metabolism may impact T cell responses in obese mice. These findings could be indicative of direct or indirect T cell-metabolite interactions, although it is also possible that these associations are biologically insignificant. Nonetheless, identification of BAL and mLN T cell-metabolite correlates provides a more dynamic and global assessment of the consequences of obesity during influenza infection.The urinary and fecal data are particularly interesting given the non-invasive nature of these bio-samples and the high degree of separation detected between naïve and infected, lean and obese mice. Numerous reports have established metabolic profiling of urine can identify biomarkers and metabolic matrices that can distinguish disease states, with the capability of ultimately guiding treatment [61]–[63]. At 2 dpi, prior to significant weight loss and any obvious signs of sickness, we identified a unique metabolic fingerprint in the urine and feces of influenza infected obese mice, consisting of perturbations in lipid, nucleotide, carbohydrate, microbial, and vitamin metabolism. Given the rapidity of influenza transmission during epidemics and pandemics and the sudden onset of severe symptoms in infected individuals [14], identification of a metabolic profile unique to an early infection time point holds widespread implications for personal and public health. We have identified a metabolic signature that could be used to predict influenza infection status even prior to any obvious signs of illness. Further testing can determine if this signature is unique to influenza infection rather than a generalized response to an infection or inflammation.Taken together, this investigation establishes metabolic profiling as a useful tool for characterizing infection responses during influenza and identifying potential pathways and mechanisms contributing to altered immunity in obese mice. Teasing apart differential responses during influenza infection is key to understanding the mechanisms driving greater disease severity in obese mice compared with lean mice. Further utilization of metabolic profiling as a complimentary tool to immunological measures of infection outcome could help advance the current knowledge of the response to influenza infection in other rodent research models and may have potential applications in clinical and research settings.']"
2013-12-20T00:00:00Z,Social Aggregation in Pea Aphids: Experiment and Random Walk Modeling,"[""Through experiment and modeling, we have investigated the movement, social behavior, and aggregation of the pea aphid. Motion-tracked experimental data gives rise to a two-state model in which aphids transition stochastically between stationary and moving states. Moving aphids follow a correlated random walk. The state transition probabilities PMS and PSM, the random walk step length , and the random walk turning angle distribution spread ρ all depend on distance to an aphid's nearest neighbor, d. These four quantities have each been fit with a functional form incorporating three or four parameters whose values we estimated from the experimental data. To assess the efficacy of our model in reproducing group-level behaviors, we compared experimental data to outputs of our social nearest neighbor model and a control (noninteracting) model. We found that the social model reproduces the distribution of nearest neighbors and the distribution of fraction of moving aphids better than the control model. The experiment and both models display no difference for a third group-level property, namely angle to nearest neighbor.Our mathematical model is strikingly different from some previous data-driven aggregation models. The model of golden shiner fish in [30] and the model of surf scoter ducks in [32] are primarily deterministic, describing organisms that simultaneously attract, repel, and align. In these studies, noise additively modulates an organism's intended direction at each time step, presumably to describe errors in sensing and movement capabilities. In contrast, our model has rules that are fundamentally random. Fig. 2 shows that aphids under similar conditions (same distance to nearest neighbor) display different behaviors (transitioning vs. not transitioning motion state). Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 suggest that the movement process for aphids is a random walk.The biological conclusions of our work are as follows. First, we have provided strong quantitative evidence that pea aphids display social behavior, in that an individual's movement in a featureless environment is influenced by its nearest neighbor.Second, we have gained insight into the mechanism by which aphids aggregate. The probability of a stationary aphid starting to move decreases if a neighbor is nearby. The probability of a moving aphid stopping increases if a neighbor is nearby. These two behaviors promote aggregation. Further, aphids that are moving take shorter steps and turn more when in the vicinity of neighbors, promoting motion that is more diffusive and less ballistic (that is, less likely to move it away from the neighbor). This is reminiscent of the classic run-and-tumble model of bacteria [53]. In short, aggregation occurs through movement decreasing in the proximity of other aphids as opposed to direct locomotion towards individuals or clusters.ThirdFinally, our model of individual-level behavior gives some feeling for the sensing range of the aphid. We recall the exponential length scales , , , and . These characteristic length scales are on the order of 1–3 aphid body lengths.As evidenced by the metrics in the previous section, our individual-based social model reproduces group-level featuresbehaviors muchbetter than a control model. There remain many avenues for further investigation. While we have demonstrated that pea aphid behavior promotes aggregation, we have not focused on quantifying the degree of aggregation (beyond measuring the distribution of distance to nearest neighbor). One could investigate the typical population size of an aggregation and the typical time scales of an aggregation's formation and existence. Furthermore, we have not captured all of the experimental complexity in our simple model. As mentioned throughout, we have ignored the effects of the boundary. It would be useful to quantify more precisely the rules an aphid obeys when it encounters an immovable obstacle such as a boundary. Additionally, our model is arguably the simplest possible social model, in which social effects depend on a single nearest neighbor. One could investigate the degree to which an aphid responds simultaneously to multiple neighbors, keeping in mind the limits of aphid cognition. Finally, it could be interesting to augment our work, which describes aphid aggregation the absence of environmental cues, with a consideration of external factors such as nutrition sources. Such an investigation might shed further light on the aphid's role as a destructive crop pest.""]"
2013-10-10T00:00:00Z,Understanding the Sustainability of Retail Food Recovery,"['In this paper we provide the first formal investigation of the fundamental sustainabiliy of food recovery. We develop a novel model that can be used for Monte Carlo style simulation using fitted empirical parameters, and we show that this model reproduces the dynamics observed by CFS. While we believe that this model can represent a large class of similar regions with a mix of rural and urban environments, we are careful to remind the reader that our conclusions may not apply in disparite environments (i.e., dense urban or sparse rural). In future work, we hope to integrate additional data in order to broaden our conclusions and perform a more rigorous validation of our model.Our chief experimental findings in this work are:\nFood supply (waste) events are heavy-tailed and can be well described with extreme value theory “peaks over threshold” models and the generalized Pareto distribution.\n\nThe efficacy of food recovery hinges on the ability to keep rescued food from perishing.\n\nDespite the underlying heavy-tailed process and complexity of the model, the supply appears to be a linear function of the number of participating donors. Hence, doubling the number of participating donors is likely to double the amount of food available.\n\nThe cost of food recovery can be reduced substantially simply by increasing the number of participating donors (and therefore creating more opportunity for food supply events to occur, when they are required by demand).\n\nIn the scenario we studied in north central Colorado, we have shown that there is substantially more food available than what is currently being recovered. Increasing recovery efforts could reduce both hunger and waste in the region.\nIn future work, we will expand this investigation to address additional questions. We are interested in whether this model can be scaled up to a state or national level. It stands to reason that dense urban and sparse rural environments will produce substantially different cost and supply dynamics. However, understanding how these dynamics affect the efficacy of food recovery is an open question. There are approximately 85,000 grocery stores and 566,000 food service organizations in the US [14], [15]. In [16], Bloom suggests that the typical food waste associated with a restuarant is on average 3,000 lbs per employee, per year (or 123 lbs/day for a 15 employee restaurant). Clearly, there is no shortage of potential donors; the important question is whether they are well positioned for recovery and whether the cost of rescue is acceptable.An additional question is one of nutrition. In our current study, we looked at bulk pounds of food without concern for the type. This is a simplification that has bearing on both the economics of the problem (supply and demand) and the basic expiry of the food. Currently, 88% of grocery stores nationally donate some dry goods, 51% donate produce, and 31% donate prepped food and meat [16]. Fresh and healthful foods are the hardest for food banks to acquire since they have a limited shelf life (small ), which is negatively affected by transportation, time, stocking time, and pickup limitations (how many pickups per week are possible). Optimizing pickup strategies to capitalize on small food waste events, and sufficiently funding food rescue organizations so that they have the resources to pickup food when it is available might mitigate this problem. A complete solution might require recovery efforts at multiple scales and with varying technologies.Although preliminary, our work here is an important first step towards understanding the dynamics and limitations of food recovery to mitigate hunger. In the end, we can present the positive result that, despite its underlying complexity, food recovery can be considered a stable process where obtaining additional food is simply a function of having sufficient participating donors and funding to perform pickups. We hope that this work will help to spur interest in this area, equally among researchers who might be able to bring additional insight into the problem, businesses who can agree to donate their food waste, and policy makers who posess the ability to procure needed funding and resources for food rescue organizations to succeed.']"

2015-08-14T00:00:00Z,Intraspecies Genomic Diversity and Long-Term Persistence of Bifidobacterium longum,"['The taxonomy and systematics of B. longum species was subjected to multiple changes in the recent decades. The groups ""longum"", ""infantis"" and ""suis"" had been first described as three distinct species, followed by their unification as the biovars of B. longum. Finally the three groups were reclassified as three subspecies [17,85]. In this study, the members of the subspecies were found to be clearly distinct using nearly all genetic criteria—the concatenated sequences of multiple core genes, average nucleotide identity and the total gene content. Using the comparative genomics approach we also confirmed the different ecological specialization of the subspecies: overrepresentation of the genes involved in metabolism of the milk-derived oligosaccharides in subsp. infantis and the metabolism of the plant-derived carbohydrates in subsp. longum. However, this study (as well as the study [18]) revealed many cases of misidentifications between three subspecies, reflecting their general phenotypic similarity and elusiveness of the border between them, which complicates the classical methods of bacterial identification. While the sequencing of 16S rRNA is known to be a robust method for discriminating between human-associated subspecies longum and infantis [29], the subspecies suis may be easily misidentified.According to the data obtained using ClonalFrame, the overall impact of HGT on the evolution of the human-associated subspecies of B. longum was found to be considerably high. The effect of homologous recombination on the diversity of housekeeping genes was found to be comparable to the effect of point mutations, similar to the result acquired for Bacillus and Escherichia [86]. This could be explained at least in part by the abundance of phages and the existence of conjugative plasmids in the populations of humans-associated bifidobacteria. The pan-genome of B. longum subsp. longum (and in some way the pan-genome of the species B. longum) was found to be open meaning that new orthologous groups of genes could be discovered in every newly sequenced strain. The non-conservative part of the genome was found to be enriched with genes of cell envelope biosynthesis, such as rhamnose biosynthesis clusters and glycosyltransferase genes, reflecting the high individuality of host-microbe and microbe-microbe interaction systems in every strain of B. longum subsp. longum.An interesting question for further studies is the relative impact of different HGT mechanisms on the evolution of the three subspecies of B. longum. An important role in the generation of genomic diversity may be played by temperate phages. The genomes used in a present study contained a large number of prophage sequences, but none of these prophages have been isolated in culture and studied experimentally, so the efficiency of phage-related gene transfer in B. longum still needs to be determined. Another important source of genomic diversity in bifidobactreria could be associated with plasmids, both small cryptic ones and the recently described megaplasmids. In this study, we observed several cases of isolation of fully identical plasmids from far-related strains isolated from the same patient at the same time, suggesting the possibility of fast plasmid transfer between bifidobacteria. An intriguing fact is that the frequency of plasmid-containing strains is distributed unequally among the three subspecies of B. longum. While plasmids are highly prevalent in B. longum subsp. longum, it seems like plasmids in the other two subspecies are very scarce if not absent at all [87]. Interestingly, the only plasmid-containing strain of B. longum subsp. infantis 157F was reclassified as B. longum subsp. longum in this study. The causes of such difference between the subspecies are unknown, and the impact of this phenomenon on the genomic diversity in B. longum should be further evaluated.In this study we described two individual cases of long-term persistence of closely related strains of B. longum subsp. longum in human intestinal microbiota. However, we haven\'t succeeded in the isolation of fully identical strains from the same individual at different time points. One could hypothesize, that the situation observed can be explained by the high plasticity of intestinal microbiota on the strain level combined with the fine-tuned selection of subsets of the strains highly adapted for each individual host organism. The factors involved in this selection require further intensive studies and can include the host genotype, the repertoire of immune cell receptors, environmental and diet factors, and the individual composition of other microbes in gut microbiota.']"
2018-12-10T00:00:00Z,Socioeconomic differences in body mass index in Spain: An intersectional multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy,"['Our study confirms the existence of socioeconomic differences in BMI in Spain at the time of the survey. However, these differences show a more complex pattern than that provided by most previous studies focused on one or a few independent socioeconomic dimensions. The socioeconomic context (i.e., the intersectional strata) the individual belongs to conditions their individual BMI to an observable degree (ICC = 12.4%), but only a minor part of this general contextual effect is due to the existence of the interaction of effects (14%) between the variables that define the intersectional strata, the majority being due to additive effects of these variables (86%).Underlying the intersectional strata heterogeneity, we observed that differences in BMI are particularly notable across levels of educational achievement, especially in women.While our study gives worthy empirical information, it also presents an innovative and original contribution to research on obesity inequalities in the Spanish population, through the application of a MAIHDA within an intersectional framework [29, 33, 34]. This approach provides a better understanding of the socioeconomic gradient in obesity while at the same time improving the information for policy makers concerned with the prevention of overweight and obesity. According to our results, public policies and actions aiming to tackle obesity should be focused on improving living conditions in order to stop the rapid progress of this chronic disease, since, according to OECD projections, obesity figures will rise continuously up to 2030 [82]. In addition, the OECD report [82] exposes how inequalities in obesity and overweight are widening worldwide. It has also been indicated that in order to avoid such increases, policy design should account for demographic and socioeconomic variables [99]. However, we suggest this policy design should adopt an intersectional perspective that considers the size of the general contextual effects. If it (i.e., the ICC) is large, the intervention should focus on the most disadvantaged intersectional strata. However, if the ICC is small, the focus would be on the entire population as intersectional strata have less significance for BMI. On the basis of our study results, both strategies should be combined. International and national institutions must develop policy programs that integrate a multi-dimensional perspective [71], combining economic, social and prevention actions, directed not only at the individual level, but also at the community level [1, 100]. In addition, broad macro- or meso-level policies can be beneficial across groups, and particularly assist underprivileged groups [101], while avoiding misguided and potentially stigmatizing policies based on targeted intervention [57, 59].In some European countries, intervention strategies targeted at improving the education of individuals have achieved reductions in obesity rates [102], as investment in education is analogous with investment in health [99]. Hence, governments should implement actions to decrease inequalities pertaining to both income and education, through fiscal, social or employment policies. For instance, public social expenditure, especially that of educational and health services, should be increased, or more progressive taxation should be promoted, enabling the improvement of the pension system, social benefits and working conditions, thus eliminating the barriers to access to a better social welfare. Since obesity is related to low levels of physical activity and a poor quality of diet [1, 6, 100, 103–105], preventive strategies should also promote healthier lifestyles [100, 106] through attempts to tackle sedentary habits and the excessive intake of sugar, salt, junk food and sweetened drinks [82, 100]. Several such interventions are already being implemented in Spain, for example the NAOS Strategy [105, 107, 108], which included many actions with these aims [109], or the tax on sugary drinks introduced in Catalonia in 2017 [110].In summary, in harmony with the previous study by Evans et al [33], our work provides an improved theoretical and quantitative instrument for documenting BMI disparities compared to traditional studies on (unidimensional) socioeconomic gradients in health. Therefore, we suggest that this approach should become an essential methodological tool in health disparities research [29].']"
2013-08-07T00:00:00Z,Is Bone Tissue Really Affected by Swimming? A Systematic Review,"['Although few studies found lower BMD in swimmers when compared to sedentary controls most of the research shows similar BMD for both groups independently of the age group, except for later adulthood where swimmers presented lower bone mass decrease than sedentary controls, although it is not clear if these differences are sport-specific or are due to the more active life-style reported in swimmers. It would therefore appear that swimming does not negatively affect bone mass. Swimmers mostly showed lower BMD values than any other SG independently of the age of the sample. In fact, longitudinal studies showed lower BMD increases during a season in this specific sport-group. Nevertheless, swimmers showed higher bone turnover values than sedentary controls that were not reflected in higher BMD. This higher bone turnover seems to be associated with a more efficient bone structure of swimmers which appears to be weaker when compared with high impact sports and stronger when compared to sedentary controls, independently of the method of analysis. Many factors may interfere in the effect of swimming on bone, although no differences among groups were found in some of them such as hormone concentrations or calcium intake, the influence as confounders of these factors has not been elucidated.\nPerspective\nThere are 3 relevant remaining questions:\n\nHow many hours per week, years of practice and intensity of training are needed in order to obtain this structure?\n\nIs it possible to obtain this improved structure at any stage of life, or is it only possible during childhood and/or adolescence?\n\nHow long does this structure perdure without activity?\n\nFuture research is needed to ascertain some of these questions and establish structural benefits of swimming on bone tissue. It is also noteworty that swimming presents lower risks of traumatic fracture than other high impact sports, it is beneficial for cardiovascular fitness [111], and has an important role not only in the promotion of well-being but also in the improvement of muscle strength, which can prevent falls and resulting fractures [112]. Therefore if the previous questions were answered in a positive way, swimming may be a higly benefitial sport to practice regarding bone health.\nFuture studies in this area should take into consideration the following aspects:\nEvaluation method should include:\n\nImaging techniques: Two techniques should be employed in each study. DXA is essential and a second method of the researchers choice to evaluate bone structure, preferebly pQCT or MRI.\n\nBone metabolic markers: To evaluate metabolic activity and view bone remodeling process.\n\n\nPhysical activity register\n\nAccelerometry: In order to evaluate physical activity objectively.\n\nQuestionnaires: To evaluate past and current physical activity. This might be of extreme importance in studies performed in adults or elderly population.\n\n\nDiet\nTo evaluate calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D intake in addition to total energy intake and other nutrients that might affect bone and body composition is of crucial importance.\n             \nOther confounders\n\nType of swimming: It is important to distinguish, if possible, between sprint swimmers and long distance swimmers due to the fact that they might present different types of training routines and these might involve different types of efforts that might affect bone in a different way.\n\nYears of practice, and weekly hours trained: Particularly when performing a study that compares sport disciplines.\n\nComplementary weight work: Many swimmers perform weight training in order to improve their performances. This should also be registered and taken into account in future studies.\n\nPoint of the season: Training loads change according to the season period and this might affect bone that is constantly adapting. When performing studies that compare sports, evaluation should take place in similar load pattern periods of the different sports.\n\nTanner stage: When performing studies with children or adolescents, tanner stage should always be registered as differences in bone might be partly due to maturation status.\n\nMenstrual status: This is another important variable to take into account due to the close relation that it has with bone.\n\n          \n']"
2014-03-05T00:00:00Z,How to Kill the Honey Bee Larva: Genomic Potential and Virulence Mechanisms of Paenibacillus larvae,"['It has been shown that the bacterial life cycle in infected larvae can be divided into two stages (Figure 7) [8]. The genome analysis identified genes, which may encode for all crucial steps of the known life cycle. The early phase of infection is non-invasive and includes ingestion of spore-contaminated food, and subsequently spore germination and proliferation in the midgut lumen. The vegetative bacteria proliferate massively in the midgut lumen prior to breaching the epithelium. During this non-invasive stage P. larvae can be considered a commensal bacterium living from the content of the larval diet, i.e., sugars like glucose and fructose. Indeed, P. larvae is able to metabolize different sugars and sugar derivatives [12], [82] through several metabolic pathways identified in this study. Although P. larvae does not actively attack the infected larvae at this stage of infection, the bacteria are living on the expense of the larvae by competing for incoming food. Therefore, it is not surprising that a recent study of infected larvae using comparative proteomics revealed that infected larvae express higher levels of mitochondrial metabolic enzymes and deplete their energy stores during infection [55]. Thus an enhanced energy demand of infected larvae compared to non-infected larvae is indicated.10.1371/journal.pone.0090914.g007Figure 7\nP. larvae infection model.\nThe non-invasive phase is followed by penetration of the midgut epithelium and subsequent invasion of the haemocoel via the paracellular route by sequentially destroying the peritrophic matrix, cell-cell junctions, the extracellular matrix, and the larval remains [8]. Bacterial factors likely to be involved in this process are different toxins and secreted extracellular proteases. The extraordinary proteolytic capacity of P. larvae has been the topic of many studies [16], [41], [83], [84]. In both genotypes, our DNA sequence-based gene prediction supports the existence of a high number of proteases, which might be involved in several mechanisms during the invasive stage. (i) Proteases able to degrade antimicrobial peptides might neutralize the local immune response mounted by the epithelial cells and help P. larvae to survive in the midgut lumen and attack the epithelial barrier. (ii) Once the bacteria have access to the epithelium, proteases, possibly in conjunction with toxins, might be responsible for the disruption of the epithelial barrier integrity by degrading cell-cell and cell-matrix junctions. (iii) Collagenases are then needed to degrade the basement membrane and facilitate access to the underlying tissues. (iv) Once the larvae are dead, proteases are further needed for the subsequent degradation of the larval remains (ropy stage). Pure cultures of P. larvae can be obtained from dead larvae at this stage of the pathogenic process [85], a fact that can now be explained by the expression of potent antibiotics as identified in the genomes of both P. larvae genotypes. Vegetative bacteria then undergo sporulation and the formed spores drive disease transmission within the colony when disseminated to and ingested by the next larvae.We have answered many questions with respect to the molecular pathogenesis of P. larvae by identifying several novel and important virulence factors of P. larvae involved in different steps in pathogenesis. However, our data also raise a new question: It has been shown that P. larvae genotype ERIC II is more virulent on the larval level than genotype ERIC I. Surprisingly, we now discovered that the toxins identified in ERIC I (strain DSM 25719) are lacking in the genome of ERIC II (DSM 25430). DSM 25430 strain only harbors non-functional remnants of toxin orthologs found in DSM 25719. In addition, many ERIC II strains lack several proteases (enhancin-like protease, serine proteases), which might also be of central importance for pathogenesis. Considering the high number of predicted genes with unknown function in both genomes (2133 in DSM 25719 and 1400 in DSM 25430) it is possible that unknown toxins or some other novel virulence factor are encoded by these genes. Our genome analysis showed that, although both genotypes are lethal for infected larvae and degrade the larval remains to a ropy mass, they obviously developed different modes of attacking and killing honey bee larvae. Understanding these differences in pathogenesis and elucidating the different virulence mechanisms is a prerequisite for the development of specific treatments against both P. larvae genotypes.']"
2020-01-16T00:00:00Z,"Multidisciplinary investigation of two Egyptian child mummies curated at the University of Tartu Art Museum, Estonia (Late/Graeco-Roman Periods)","['This study has furthered our understanding of the two child mummies in the museum collection. Firstly, the chronology, embalming technique and bandages, together with genetic data, all suggest an Egyptian provenance, confirming the available historical sources. From a palaeopathological viewpoint, we were only able to note nonspecific stress markers on the older mummy (KM A 64), namely the enamel hypoplasia and Harris lines, indicative of poor diet or disease, as well as a possible cyst on its mandible, leaving the precise cause of death still unknown [37, 38]. As far as mummification is concerned, it is clear that excerebration was achieved trans-nasally, a feature of Egyptian embalming since the New Kingdom [80]. This is especially important to note, because in the Graeco-Roman Period this practice could be waived, especially among children [39]. However, evisceration was still common, as is clearly evidenced by the flank incisions present on both mummies. It is quite possible that the viscera were returned to the body in wrapped packages, although this was more common in the 21st to 25th Dynasties [12]. However, the packages in the torsos of the two mummies suggest that this tradition might have continued. The absence of the heart in both children is curious as traditionally it was left in the body as it played a key role in the attainment of an Afterlife, both for adults and children. It is possible that the hearts of both these mummies are so covered with resin that they could not be identified, or it is conceivable that the hearts were removed inadvertently and never returned to the body, as has been found in other Egyptian mummies [81].The initial body positions of the subjects varied as seen in other samples of the period [12]. These indicate differences in the wrapping techniques and in the ways these children had been handled before and after the dehydration of soft tissues. In addition, the male sex of both subjects appears to be in accordance with other data, which shows that the practice of preserving dead non-adults appears to favour males [42].The embalming materials that were used for these mummies are in keeping with other mummies of this time period [59, 82]. Degraded plant oils and/or animal fats were detected as the main components with clear inclusion of resinous compounds, most likely relating to Pinaceae resins and maybe some pitches, various aromatic compounds, and, interestingly, polysaccharides (plant gum?). Furthermore, inclusion of waxes (most likely beeswax) was also detected. As additional and previously less detected constituents, traces of ricinoleic acid (castor oil), coumarin (galbanum) and probably bituminous material, were present as well. The latter is of interest as previously little evidence for this material has been identified in embalming materials, although Greek texts refer to it as a significant component of mummification [39]. It is noteworthy that the analytical results from samples of the head and body area, as well as textile-impregnating materials revealed slight differences in their components—perhaps specific solutions were used for different parts of the body as part of the mummification ritual. Also, we were able to identify traces of various salts most probably used for desiccating the body [54].The textiles are also consistent with Egyptian mummies. The inscribed bandages (see above) and the use of linen amulets [14] support the AMS dating, and serve to narrow it a bit further, placing the mummies in the Ptolemaic era.The previous destructive activities carried out on these bodies do not allow us to reconstruct precisely the pattern, if any, of stuffing and wrapping the body, but we could identify that at least partly reused linen was used for wrapping. Those in the body of the younger mummy may have served to give it more shape, and quite possibly the four packages in the other body correspond to the four different viscera that were removed traditionally: lungs, liver, intestines and stomach.Thus, our study has provided an extensive body of new information on the two child mummies, by both reconstructing their biological profiles and investigating their provenance and mummification of these items, adding not only to the data available on Egyptian mummies now kept in the Baltic states [83–85], but also to the corpus of child mummies from ancient Egypt.']"
2013-11-11T00:00:00Z,Tuberculin Skin Test Result and Risk of Death among Persons with Active TB,"['We observed that patients reported to the US surveillance system with culture-confirmed active TB and a negative TST result were significantly more likely to die after initiation of TB treatment than patients with a positive TST result. This relationship persisted even after adjustment for HIV status, site of TB disease, sputum smear AFB status at baseline, drug susceptibility at baseline, age, sex, and origin of birth.Our results are consistent with several smaller studies of children, persons with HIV, and immunocompetent adults where a negative TST in the setting of active disease has been associated with a two to three-fold increase in the risk of death. [10], [11], [19] The risk of death associated with a negative TST at the time of disease is also evident in a native Brazilian population with high rates of anergy (46%), severe clinical manifestations, and high mortality from TB disease [20].The benefit of having a positive TST at the time of disease may have parallels with the effects of BCG vaccination in early childhood. In general, children who have been vaccinated show a transient positive TST response and are less likely to develop disseminated forms of disease, and are less likely to die if they do develop TB disease. [21], [22] Our results suggest that the host immune response in the setting of active TB disease that is measured by a TST might be similar to the immune response triggered by BCG vaccination in children and potentially mitigates against death.Functional differences have been observed in the cytokine profiles of TB patients who are TST-negative and TST-positive including antigen-specific impairments in IL-2, IL-10, and IFN-γ production. [19], [23]–[25] These impairments in cytokine production and subsequent perturbations in the T-helper 1 and T-helper 2 balance of TST-negative patients may result in impaired ability to control TB disease. Poor clinical outcomes of patients with interferon-gamma receptor mutations and other forms of inherited susceptibility to mycobacterial disease also underscore the importance of cellular immune function, the basis of the TST result, in the successful treatment of TB. [26] Together, these observations indicate that patients with a negative TST may not possess adequate immune function to control TB infection, even in the setting of TB treatment. Future research is warranted to examine how the TST result may serve as an indicator of responsiveness to TB treatment.Tuberculin skin testing is considered an adjunctive test to support the diagnosis of TB in the United States. [27] Our data indicate that tuberculin skin testing is not consistently performed as only 56% of patients with TB disease in the surveillance database had a TST result reported. We found that persons with HIV, persons older than 65 years, and persons with extrapulmonary or miliary disease were less likely to have a TST result reported. These groups are also more likely to have a negative TST and so it is possible that the association between TST and death is even stronger than what we found in our analysis. We were not able to determine the effect of other immunocompromising conditions on TST and outcome because U.S. surveillance data prior to 2009 do not include information on conditions, other than HIV infection, such as nutritional status, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal disease, or treatments such as TNF-α antagonists that affect immune function and may impact TST results. [1], [4], [9], [28] Furthermore, data from California, which accounts for approximately 20% of TB cases in the United States, were excluded because HIV results were not routinely reported to CDC. Recognizing these limitations of surveillance data it will be necessary to conduct prospective research to verify the findings of this retrospective observational surveillance data analysis.We recommend increased utilization of the TST in clinical research to systematically evaluate how the TST result may inform clinical care of persons with TB. In addition to serving as a marker of the risk of developing active disease among TB contacts, the TST result appears to be a marker for risk of death in patients with TB disease. However, further research is needed to determine what host or pathogen factors contribute to this increased risk of death observed among patients with a negative TST, and also to determine whether the same associations with death are seen with the newer interferon gamma release assays. Further study of the factors associated with death among patients with a negative TST may help identify strategies to improve survival.']"
2018-01-11T00:00:00Z,Biting mechanics and niche separation in a specialized clade of primate seed predators,"['We found that the feeding biomechanics of pitheciine monkeys (Pithecia, Chiropotes, Cacajao) are consistent with a diet that includes mechanically resistant foods (unripe fruits and seeds). During simulations of canine and second molar biting, pitheciines out-performed Callicebus with respect to the mechanical efficiency (leverage) of bite force production and resistance to masticatory strain. However, Cacajao was found to experience unexpectedly high facial strain magnitudes relative to the other pitheciines in some regions of the face. We therefore found limited support for the hypothesis that Callicebus-Pithecia-Chiropotes-Cacajao represent a morphocline of increasing sclerocarpic specialization [10], at least with respect to the mechanical performance metrics examined here. In fact, strain magnitudes during canine biting were more likely to follow a Cacajao-Chiropotes-Pithecia trend of increasing craniofacial strength, in contrast to the proposed morphocline. On the other hand, we found that Callicebus-Pithecia-Chiropotes/Cacajao represent a gradient of increasing canine MA, with leverage in Cacajao nearly identical to (or slightly less than) in Chiropotes. Together, these results could indicate that increased bite force efficiency and increasingly derived anterior dental morphology was selected for in pitheciines at the expense of higher craniofacial strain magnitudes. However, the unexpectedly weak facial skeleton of Cacajao potentially reflects reduced feeding competition with other pitheciines; this reduced competition allows uakaris to choose from a wider variety of fruits at various stages of ripeness, leading to reduction in the selection for robust facial features.We also found that Pithecia and Chiropotes exhibit differences in biting performance that are consistent with food structural property data and previous observations of dietary niche separation between these sister taxa [9, 26, 32], supporting the hypothesis that sakis and bearded sakis are able to reduce competition and remain sympatric by specializing on fruits and seeds at different stages of ripeness. Consistent with data on fruit puncture resistance, we found that bite force production and efficiency during canine biting was greatest in Chiropotes. Biting leverage was also great at the molar in Chiropotes, but Pithecia was found to be better suited for the regular forceful crushing and grinding of seeds using the postcanine teeth, consistent with data on seed crushing resistance and molar root surface area.Future studies investigating the dietary ecology of pitheciines should focus on the collection of mechanical properties of foods eaten by Cacajao. Although uakaris have traditionally been considered a flooded forest specialist (e.g., [42]), which has complicated attempts to study their dietary ecology, recent work indicates that not all species are restricted to such habitats. A recent review of all available information concerning the habitat of Ca. calvus ucayalii [105] concluded that this species is more flexible in habitat preference than previously thought and most frequently occupies non-flooded terra firme forests or mixed habitats. For example, uakaris at the Lago Preto Conservation Concession in Iquitos, Peru are commonly associated with terra firme forest [106], which offers high potential for a detailed study of Cacajao dietary ecology and the collection of food mechanical properties. Future work on feeding ecology in Cacajao and other pitheciines will also allow for more detailed collection of data on fruit size, gape, and paramasticatory feeding behaviors, such as when using the hands to pull fruits or when manipulating a fruit to avoid biting along its largest dimension [31]. One limitation of the current study is that our biting simulations have not taken the broad range of such behaviors into account.Much-needed research exploring the relationship between primate food mechanical/structural properties and their ecological significance has been growing in recent years (e.g., [31, 36, 48, 107–117]). With respect to pitheciines, Norconk and colleagues [9, 26, 32] quantify fruit and seeds eaten by Pithecia and Chiropotes in terms of their puncture and crushing resistance (i.e., structural properties). Lucas [118] suggests that the mechanical properties E (Young’s modulus, a measure of material stiffness) and R (fracture toughness, a measure of resistance to fracture propagation) more accurately describe food fragmentation during ingestion and mastication, and may have more of a direct influence on the evolution of the masticatory apparatus. Therefore, it is an appropriate question as to whether E and R explain niche partitioning in pitheciines equally well. Future work should focus on the incorporation of both structural and mechanical food properties into the analysis of craniofacial form in pitheciines.']"
2017-11-30T00:00:00Z,Hepatic Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator (ARNT) regulates metabolism in mice,"['Hepatocyte Arnt deletion resulted in increased fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, increased glucose production after pyruvate challenge, impaired insulin sensitivity and increased post-prandial serum TG. These changes are similar to those seen in people with T2D and the metabolic syndrome. Hepatocyte HIF-1α and HIF2α deletion had no significant effect on metabolism. Assessment of liver ATP and TG content showed that both were significantly reduced in fasted LARNT mice.People with T2D have increased HGP [6]. PEPCK and G6Pase are critical enzymes in gluconeogenesis [35, 36] and PEPCK is increased in T2D [37]. G6Pase catalyses the final step in gluconeogenesis and is increased in diabetic animals [36, 38]. The increase in G6Pase and trend to increased Pepck observed in LARNT mice is consistent with a role for ARNT in the regulation of HGP.It has recently been demonstrated by magnetic resonance spectroscopy that both ATP and flux through ATP (fATP) are reduced in the livers of T2D patients compared to age matched controls [39, 40]. Further, liver ATP correlated with hepatic insulin sensitivity even after controlling for hepatocyte lipid content [40]. We found that hepatic Arnt deletion in LARNT animals resulted in substantially decreased liver ATP and this reduction in ATP was accompanied by an increase in HGP.We previously reported an acute model of Arnt ablation using adenoviral delivery of Cre-recombinase [29]. In common with short-term deletion, long-term loss of Arnt also led to alterations in gluconeogenic and lipogenic mRNAs in the liver, increased HGP and deterioration in glucose tolerance. These experiments provide confirmation of these findings using a genetic model.It was interesting to see that these alterations do not occur in LHIF1α mice, or HIF2α mice. ARNT is a class I member of the bHLH-PAS family, and usually functions in a heterodimer with a class II member. Class II members including HIF1α, HIF2α, AhR, BMAL1 and some of the clock/ circadian rhythm protein. With HIF1α and HIF2α deletion using the same Cre-driver (albumin-Cre) not causing the same effects, another partner must be involved. Based on known effects of AhR, including a ~23% incidence of diabetes in AhR null mice, we speculate that the important ARNT-partner for glucose regulation in hepatocytes may be AhR.Long term Arnt deletion resulted in elevated postprandial serum TG which was not observed after short term deletion. The question of what actually occurs to ARNT’s partners and functionality in diabetic human liver remains unknown. It has however been reported that HIF-1α expression was transiently increased in the mouse livers after high fat/sucrose diet, and expression is also increased in the bile duct ligation model of liver fibrosis and in ethanol induced fatty liver [41–43]. To add to the likelihood that HIF-1α activity is altered in the setting of diabetes evidence suggests that HIF-1α activity is reduced at high glucose concentrations [44–47].The alterations in lipid handling following Arnt deletion are noteworthy in that LARNT mice showed reduced hepatic lipid content on fasting compared to controls but no difference in the fed state. The mechanism for this effect is unclear, but may relate to alterations in lipid handling with fasting. It is consistent with the hepatosteatosis seen with increasing ARNT+HIF signaling by hepatic Vhl deletion [24, 48–50]. Increasing signaling of the ARNT + HIF-2α pair has been suggested to be important for liver lipid accumulation [49, 50]. The role of ARNT + HIF-1α is less clear with conflicting studies reported [42, 43]. Perhaps paradoxically, given greater falls in liver and serum triglyceride with fasting in LARNT mice, LARNT mice had reduced lipid oxidation. The technique for measurement of lipid oxidation measures complete oxidation, detecting CO2 at the end of the pathway. It is conceivable that in LARNT mice this process is inefficient, resulting in higher lipid use but incomplete utilization. That and impaired glucose uptake / glycolysis gene expression is consistent with the substantially lower ATP content. These changes together would be predicted to increase susceptibility to liver damage with age and stress.Our data clearly demonstrate for the first time that long-term Arnt deletion regulates both hepatic glucose and lipid homeostasis. These animals show increased HGP, reduced hepatic ATP and increased fed serum TG. Increasing ARNT/HIF signaling could potentially improve these parameters in T2D and MetS patients.']"
2017-05-22T00:00:00Z,Messinian age and savannah environment of the possible hominin Graecopithecus from Europe,"['For the first time we demonstrate that C4 grasses were the dominant herbaceous element of the Pikermi Formation. Our habitat reconstruction suggests fire-prone woody grasslands and woodlands within a savannah biome for Pikermi and Pyrgos and, thus, provides unambiguous evidence for the early environmental conjectures of Gaudry[36]. Given the potential hominin nature of Graecopithecus freybergi, our habitat reconstruction for the Pikermi Formation further supports the “Savannah Hypothesis” put forward to explain earliest hominin emergence[69, 71, 74]. Analysis of both potential hominin sites indicates that Graecopithecus inhabited different habitats, be it open braided-river landscapes in Azmaka[4], or the wooded grassland of Pyrgos.The Tortonian-Messinian transition in the Mediterranean appears to represent a period of significant environmental and climatic changes. During the latest Tortonian (~7.4–7.25 Ma) C4 grass ecosystems progressively penetrate the Balkan Peninsula and constitute the environment of the mammal fauna of Pikermi, which contradicts earlier assumptions [75, 76]. The classical Pikermi fauna is terminated at the beginning of the Messinian (7.25–7.10 Ma) by a significant faunal turnover (post-Pikermi turnover), accompanied by massive increase of Saharan dust and salt accumulation with profound effects on soil salinity and nutrition.Our results reveal formerly unrecognized Mediterranean environmental changes during the Tortonian-Messinian transition, which provide important constraints for the evolution of Graecopithecus freybergi. At the Tortonian-Messinian boundary (7.25 Ma), water-stress levels increased and wildfire frequency decreased, which can be interpreted as increasing aridification. Rather than representing a local phenomenon, aridification occurred on a larger scale. We demonstrate that aeolian dust accumulation was widespread at the northern Mediterranean coast and that large amount of salt-laden mineral dust and marine-based aerosols were blown from dried lake beds in North Africa toward Europe, where ~30-m-thick red silts were deposited in southern Greece and southern France. We relate this dust accumulation to progressive late Tortonian Mediterranean aridification and cooling, which started at around 7.4 Ma and culminated during the earliest Messinian, when Mediterranean Sea surface temperature dropped by about 7°C to values comparable to the present-day (Fig 4,[41, 77, 78]). Modelling studies[79] have shown that Middle Miocene Tethyan seaway closure and accelerated Late Miocene uplift of the Iranian plateau[80] provided key boundary conditions for north African aridity. We hypothesize that the ~700 kyr cooling episode[41], combined with the long-term eccentricity minimum between 7.3 and 7.2 Ma, acted as a final trigger for substantial north African aridization, which resulted in the initial formation of a large Saharan and Arabian desert belt[79, 81]. Furthermore, mineral dust in Attica was rich in soluble evaporites (halite, gypsum) in the earliest Messinian and especially during two pronounced insolation seasonality minima at 7.18 and 7.157 Ma, which suggests an orbitally driven progressive Sahara desertification. We suppose that a latest Tortonian to early Messinian dust- and salt-laden atmosphere over the Mediterranean may have further accelerated cooling and aridification via absorption of incoming solar radiation and, thus, may partially explain regionally accentuated Mediterranean cooling[41].The documented environmental changes were likely to have caused a significant faunal transition. Our dating of Graecopithecus and the taxonomy of its accompanying large mammals indicate that, during culmination of cooling at the base of the Messinian, the post-Pikermi turnover replaced part of the Pikermi fauna. Several newcomers like the elephantoid Anancus or the boselaphid Tragoportax macedoniensis have Asian affinities and we hypothesize that Eastern Mediterranean aridification played an important role in the westward shift of their habitats. Graecopithecus, as part of this new post-Pikermi fauna, lived in a warm-temperate and dusty environment unlike any other known hominid (except for our own genus). Graecopithecus predates by several hundred thousand years the next youngest candidate hominin Sahelanthropus, which occupied the southern Saharan tropics after its earliest Messinian desertification [82]. Given the potential hominin affinity of Graecopithecus, our results suggest that the Pan-Homo split predated the Messinian and that the chimpanzee–human last common ancestor thrived in the Mediterranean region. The emerging Saharan and Arabian desert belt thereby possibly acted as a vicariant agent[83]. Our conclusions support views[3] that major Miocene hominid radiations occurred outside Africa and endorse the hypothesis[5] that the hominin clade arose in the Eastern Mediterranean.']"
2015-05-20T00:00:00Z,The Long Term Response of Birds to Climate Change: New Results from a Cold Stage Avifauna in Northern England,"['The bird remains from the early MIS 3 deposits of Pin Hole represent over 20 different taxa with wetland birds dominating the assemblage species diversity. In absolute numbers, it is the Galliformes of the genus Lagopus that dominate the assemblage. In addition, there are taxa that lived in the cave or on rock outcrops, birds of open habitats and ones that require woodland to breed. The taxa identified here have added some important new taxa not on the original list of birds from the Middle Palaeolithic of Pin Hole such as the new records of long-legged buzzard Buteo rufinus and the skua Stercorarius parasiticus or S. longicaudatus. There have been a few that are not confirmed including the common gull now identified as the skua. Other taxa not confirmed are ones whose identities are difficult to identify due to the conservative skeletal anatomy of the Order including Anseriformes such as barnacle goose, white-fronted goose, ruddy shelduck, tufted duck, goosander, Passeriformes like skylark, woodlark, waxwing, redwing, hawfinch and Charadriiformes such as snipe and knot. The other taxa listed here are all confirmations of Bramwell [17] identifications and so, due to the inclusion of woodland species in MIS 3 levels, confirm his interpretations that these birds were in Britain before the Holocene, albeit in MIS 3 rather than in the Late Glacial.The fact that they were here before the LGM signifies that these populations may be unlikely to have survived to contribute to the eventual Holocene/modern populations of the species seen today. Unfortunately the mixed nature of the upper fauna signifies that Late Glacial records of such taxa recorded by Bramwell [17] cannot be confirmed without an expensive and destructive radiocarbon dating program, some of which would likely entirely destroy the representative specimens. The climatic requirements of the birds in the MIS 3 levels at Pin Hole are varied and represent perhaps the most interesting result of the study as northern Arctic/Alpine tundra, steppe to Mediterranean as well as temperate taxa are included. This mirrors the environments indicated by the mammals in the MIS 3 levels of Pin Hole [18] as well as North West Europe more widely [78,82,84]. The latter is in line with the other indications for a non-analogue environment at this time. The mixture of steppe and tundra species signify that the birds from Pin Hole MIS 3 deposits represent the avian equivalent of the well documented steppe-tundra mammals of the Late Pleistocene of Europe and equivalent latitudes across the Palaearctic and into North America.The occurrence of the birds from the North of England during MIS 3 also has an important contribution to make to the understanding of the historical biogeography of the species and particularly those with modern phylogeographic studies. In the case of the wood pigeon they may add support to an interpretation that northern refugial populations persisted through the last cold stage, while other taxa give a better context to understanding their broader climate and environmental adaptations or tolerance.Accompanying the distinctive ecological associations of the birds from MIS 3 Pin Hole are some distinct morphologies. These morphological differences mostly appear to represent size differences in the MIS 3 Pin Hole populations which may either be of evolutionary significance or representative of phenotypic plasticity. The birds that manifest different sizes are the two Lagopus species, the brent goose, the Alpine swift and the wood pigeon which are all larger than their conspecifics in Europe today. The skua may also be larger although because it plots between the two smallest skuas today it is not clear whether it is a large long-tailed skua or a small Arctic skua. Either way, the explanations for these size differences (larger birds) are likely to driven by differences in carrying capacity in the past rather than the direct effects of thermoregulatory rules like the traditional explanation for Bergmann’s Rule. Finally, there is an anomalous demoiselle crane premaxilla which is more difficult to explain. It maybe that MIS 3 North-West European demoiselle cranes differed in diet from their conspecifics living to the South and East of Europe today.The analysis of the birds from Pin Hole therefore demonstrate that the kinds of responses that birds undergo in response to long term climate change are very similar to that of mammals with both geographical displacement, resulting in non-analogue communities, as well as morphological change visible. At this stage it is, however, not known if the morphological changes detected are due to phenotypic plasticity or have a genetic mechanism and may hence involve evolutionary process. It should also be mentioned that some of the identifications here described, based on the morphology of the fossils may prove to be imprecise or even wrong once they are successfully analysed using aDNA methods [143].']"
2016-06-20T00:00:00Z,AMP-Activated Kinase (AMPK) Activation by AICAR in Human White Adipocytes Derived from Pericardial White Adipose Tissue Stem Cells Induces a Partial Beige-Like Phenotype,"['Beige adipocytes represent a newly described pool of adipocytes with physiologically important capacity of oxidation that is implicated in the pathology of type II diabetes and probably a myriad of other metabolic diseases [7, 43]. Qiang and colleagues have identified the SIRT1 –PPARγ pathway as the central regulator of beige adipocyte differentiation and function [21]. SIRT1, a protein deacetylase, is the member of the sirtuin protein family that was implicated in several human metabolic and degenerative diseases [2, 44]. SIRT1 has central role in the adaptation to fasting and other nutritional or environmental stress. SIRT1 achieves its effects through deacetylating key transcription factors (PGC-1α, FOXO1, FOXO3, p53) that then initiate transcription programs culminating in the suppression of cellular synthetic processes and the induction of cellular catabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis [2, 44]. SIRT1 works in collaboration with other cellular energy sensors such as mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR), hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), nuclear respiratory factors (NRFs) or AMPK [2, 44–47]. AMPK has very similar role to SIRT1, when cellular energy charge decreases marked by increase in AMP levels and the decrease of ATP, AMPK is activated and shuts down energy-consuming anabolic processes and turns on mitochondrial oxidation and catabolism to replenish cellular energy [25, 48].SIRT1 and AMPK not only display functional synergy, but their activity is cross-regulated [25, 49–53]. Several investigators have shown that AMPK and SIRT1 act on the same transcription factors (e.g. PGC-1α) that requires both AMPK-mediated phosphorylation and SIRT1-mediated deacetylation for activation and the subsequent induction of mitochondrial biogenesis [25]. Furthermore, AMPK and SIRT1 are also cross-connected through modulating NAMPT and hence cellular NAD+ salvage [52]. Since the same target transcription factors and SIRT1 were implicated in the differentiation and function of beige cells (e.g. PGC-1α) [15, 17, 21, 22, 54, 55] it was logical to assess the function of AMPK, which is situated upstream of SIRT1, in beige differentiation. This hypothesis was further supported by the fact that AMPK activation is important in brown adipose tissue differentiation, moreover induces differentiation of white adipocyte precursors to brown adipocytes [55–61].We used AICAR for the activation of AMPK [29] and found typical morphological features of beige cells are formed upon AICAR treatment. However, the very necessary induction of mitochondrial biogenesis and the increased expression of the markers of beige differentiation (TBX-1, UCP1, TMEM26, PRDM16, CIDEA) did not take place. It seems that AMPK activation does not induce the formation of functional beige cells in pericardial hADMSCs, but AMPK activation is restricted to the induction of morphological changes. The actual cause of the restricted capability of AMPK in inducing beige differentiation remains elusive. Terminal differentiation of beige cells depend on SIRT1 activation [21], while AMPK is capable of activating SIRT1 [25]. The interconnection between AMPK and SIRT1 relies on the modulation of small molecule enzyme cofactors such as NAD+ [25, 48]. Characteristic differences in the metabolism of these cofactors or low AMPK expression in beige cells may explain blunted response to AMPK activation, although to verify these hypothesis require further investigations.It is a question whether the restricted role of AMPK is true for adipose tissue-derived stem cells of any origin or is it specific for only (a) certain fat depot(s). Indeed, the expression of PRDM16 and TBX-1 in beige cells versus white cells is lower in our study than in another study using stem cells from subcutaneous adipose tissue [14]. Yet the question cannot be answered with certainty, however the known differences between adipose tissue depots [62, 63] makes it likely that AMPK activation may have a more pronounced effect in other adipose tissue depots. It should be noted, however, that this study is the first to report that pericardial adipose tissue-derived stem cells can be differentiated to beige adipocytes.Although several known external stimuli (hormones [7, 14–18], neuronal stimuli [19, 20] or drugs [21, 22]) may activate beige cells, the intracellular signal transduction pathways that translate these signals are still to be elucidated. It seems that β-adrenergic stimulus and signals induce beige adipocyte function [64, 65]. However, serotonin (5HT) had been shown to blunt thermogenic activity in brown and beige cells in mice [66, 67]. Our data nominate the energy and nutrient sensing system as possible actors in beige function and in signal transduction. Along the same line, there is a vast area of metabolic processes and drugs yet not investigated with regard to beige function, such as fasting and exercise mimetics, metabolic drugs and proteins, regulatory circuits of feeding and fasting or circadian rhythm—our data presented here clearly point out the vast potential of they may provide.']"
2019-01-17T00:00:00Z,Better soils for healthier lives? An econometric assessment of the link between soil nutrients and malnutrition in Sub-Saharan Africa,"['This paper reveals a significant link between spatial variation in African soil fertility and spatial variation in child health. We are not aware of earlier studies that have identified such a relation in statistical detail. In establishing this link we use estimates [18] on densities of nine macro- and micronutrients, as well as estimates on soil organic matter content, to proxy for variation in soil fertility. We subsequently assess the precise causal effect of spatial variation in these elements on incidences of child mortality, stunting wasting and underweight. We argue that these effects serve as a good proxy for assessing the magnitude of the impact of agronomic fortification -enriching inorganic fertilizers with micronutrients- as a means to alleviate malnutrition or hidden hunger.We find that joint increases in micronutrients (zinc, copper and manganese) lead to significant reductions in incidences of child mortality, stunting, wasting and underweight, specifically in areas where malaria pressure is relatively low. In regions with higher malaria pressure the effect dissipates. Greater (joint) densities of soil calcium and magnesium lead to taller children, all other things being equal, leading to increases incidences of child wasting and underweight, but to reductions in the incidences of child stunting. Finally, joint increases in soil nitrogen and organic matter content reduce incidence of child mortality and wasting. Overall the magnitude of these effects is noteworthy. A joint standard deviation increase in zinc, copper and manganese densities reduces child mortality by 4 per mille points at the median malaria intensity (from an average mortality rate of 44 per mille). For relatively low malaria pressure (1st quartile) such a micronutrient increase leads to reductions in stunting, wasting and underweight of around 2–3 percentage points (from averages of 39, 10 and 21 percentage respectively). In other words, you are what you eat, at least in the case of Sub-Saharan Africa, which in turn is also shaped by local soil conditions.These findings do suggest that building up soil nutrient stocks through agronomic fortification has its merit in reducing malnutrition and improving health. Various recent studies already document the benefits of including micronutrients in regular inorganic fertilizers as a means to increase agricultural production and productivity [10, 16] These effects on improving child health may thus be considered a co-benefit or external effect. These co-benefits inhibit a strong public good nature. Improved nutritional quality in agricultural produce is unlikely to attract a higher price in markets in SSA, next to various studies that reveal suboptimal individual spending on health goods and services to begin with. We are aware of only one study that links nutrient content of agricultural produce with actual farmer marketing decisions [58]. This study reveals that Ugandan farmers typically market produce with lower zinc content and self-consume produce with higher zinc content. In other words, these reasons may justify government subsidization of inorganic fertilizers enriched with missing (micro-)nutrients.However, the cost-benefit analysis presented in the second half of this paper dampens the enthusiasm for presenting agronomic fortification as an omnipotent and efficacious instrument to combat malnutrition. We find that in many instances the costs per DALY averted are relatively high. Only in those areas where population density is high, as well as likely levels of agricultural intensification, is agronomic fortification likely to be a cost-effective alternative. This argument is shaped by both the fact that the per capita cost of agronomic fortification is lower in such areas, next to the fact that inorganic fertilizer use is more common to begin with. Conversely, in areas with lower population densities alternatives like nutrient supplementation (in capsules or powders), food fortification, possibly in combination with genetic fortification are likely to be more cost-effective.Malnutrition continues to place a great burden on human health and development in Sub-Saharan Africa now and in the foreseeable future. The potential economic opportunities in reverting malnutrition are huge. But, solid information on cost and benefits of the various policy options, and how these differ, across regions and countries remain scarce. In filling this gap, this study made a contribution to better understand the potential for using agronomic fortification to revert malnutrition. Even though we argue that our approach provides realistic and robust insights into the potential of agronomic fortification, it remains second-best to urgently needed on the ground experimental approaches. Hence, the results from this study point to areas–high population density and low micronutrient densities- that most likely harbour the greatest potential for using agricultural fortification as a means to combat malnutrition. Such locations should be targeted first with actual field trials in which micronutrient enriched fertilizers are distributed and impact on both agricultural productivity and health indicators are monitored. Moreover, combining such trials with data collection on actual food consumption will allow for a better understanding on the precise causal channel through which changes in malnutrition may come about.']"
2014-01-31T00:00:00Z,"The Invisible Cliff: Abrupt Imposition of Malthusian Equilibrium in a Natural-Fertility, Agrarian Society","['Societies are complex systems linking natural and social features [44]; their study requires models that do the same, while drawing on comparative, historical and prehistorical records [45]. The modeling effort we describe instantiates these goals in a population ecology approach that embodies the fundamental principles discussed by Turchin [46]: exponential growth, self-limitation and consumer-resource oscillation. With Turchin [47], we take population ecology models to be tools for seeking understanding of regularities in history.Colonizing populations or those recovering from an epidemic or other catastrophe so that they are faced with comeback in a relatively empty habitat will enjoy a lengthy period of comfortable growth before they hit a quick transition to deprivation of indefinite length. Except for a very brief transition, populations in which fertility and mortality are density dependent will exist in one of two states: comfortable or deprived. This runs counter to intuitions formed by familiarity with variants of the logistic equation.We propose that growing populations in the copial phase have few means of detecting their fate more than several generations in advance of it being fully upon them. It lurks like an invisible cliff. Their Malthusian transition interval (MTI) is short. From initial settlement, the growth rate of colonizers remains constantly high and population size increases at an accelerating rate. Justifications for complacency abound. Surplus food availability declines but until food availability drops below the critical value of E\u200a=\u200a1, quality of life variables like life span, infant survival and fertility are unaffected by habitat in-fill. Absent nutritional or demographic strain felt at the household level, swelling aggregate population size is unlikely to be perceived or monitored as a signal of pending trouble. Similarly, we do not expect individuals to anticipate crisis from a declining surplus; food availability in excess of need weakens the signal. Growth rate (r) by contrast reflects palpable and personal linkages among mortality, fertility and hunger, and it or its constituent vital rates should constitute a strong household signal of environmental difficulty. However, these are constant until a few generations before the Malthusian equilibrium. The most informative and directly reliable signals, those entailing hunger and acute changes in mortality and fertility, offer virtually no lead-time.The brevity of the MTI limits options for response if adaptations require a long lead time or heavy investments of planning and implementation. It is difficult to envision that a society could successfully undertake the introduction of facilities like extensive irrigation canals, terracing or raised fields on the timespan of a couple of generations after perceiving their need, during a crisis. In a sanguine conclusion to his review of the “Archaeology of Overshoot and Collapse,” Tainter [28]:72 says:\n“overshoot is teleological, as if humans could set a target for population or consumption…[it] denies the human capacity for flexible adjustments…It usually is possible to coax more resource production by applying capital and technology, increasing labor, applying energy subsidies, and making production more knowledge-intensive.”\nGiven realistic appraisal of how unexpectedly and quickly they may impose themselves, population crises may offer little opportunity for the kind of adjustments Tainter envisions.These observations also suggest, however, that we should be cautious in extrapolating from the fate of places like Easter Island to our own situation [48]. The collapse of Pacific Island societies sometimes is portrayed as a failure to recognize the need for adaptive response. Plentiful signs were not read or were ignored, reasonable adjustments were not made, and social upheaval ensued when population finally exceeded resource capacities (cf. [49]). But this reading of the evidence entails a Lotka-Verhulst version of the world in which human failures are measured by long-standing neglect of distress signals. Our results suggest that the very salubrious Pacific Island setting is precisely the one in which the signal would anticipate problems by the slimmest of margins, perhaps coming too late for an effective response no matter how conscientious the population.Many models that place population at the heart of social upheaval envision linked resource degradation as the ultimate cause. Overexploitation provokes deteriorating yields or, in the Maya case “a population collapse precipitated by agricultural failure” [50]:141. This combination of causes may well have been the case historically. But it is important to acknowledge that population can act abruptly and with severity even in the absence of an environmental crisis. In our analyses the environmental capacity to yield resources is not declining; our plunge to Malthusian constraints does not invoke factors like reduced yield, forest clearance or soil erosion. Rather, the fate of the population resides primarily in the responses of fertility and mortality in the face of calorie shortages. Population stress and collapse might arise from punctuated demographic failure quite apart from environmental manifestation of resource overexploitation. Abrupt imposition of Malthusian constraints and insufficient MTI may well be a stand-alone culprit in social evolution.']"
2014-02-20T00:00:00Z,Treadmill Workstations: The Effects of Walking while Working on Physical Activity and Work Performance,"['The results suggest that the introduction of treadmill workstations, as hypothesized, has a significantly favorable impact on both physical activity and work performance. The total average daily activity caloric expenditure of participants increased by more than 74 calories, the consequence of a decline of more than an hour a day in sedentary activities and a concomitant increase in light and active activities. This effect is generated over the year-long duration of our experiment. Walking at work does not seem to have come at the expense of much, if any, physical activity after work; the activity effects we measured are over the entire day.Did participants trade off work for walking on the treadmill? For the entire year-long period the net performance effect of treadmill workstations is positive, amounting to about 0.69 points for employee self-rating and 1.11 for supervisor rating on a 1–10 scale. (It should be noted, however, that supervisor ratings are likely to be less sensitive to weekly changes in the performance of all of their supervisees, which may explain the lesser precision of estimates based on their ratings as compared to those based on employees’ own ratings). While we cannot determine the precise behavioral source of the performance improvements, our data are consistent with the favorable effect of physical activity on performance found by other researchers [18] using a within-person design.The transition to the new work environment is not immediate; in fact, there is an early decline in performance while participants learn how to adjust to walking while working on various tasks. Our study suggests that it is important to examine nonlinear effects over a relatively long period of time. Had we ignored nonlinearity or considered only discrete changes over arbitrary periods, we would have not estimated correctly the effects of treadmill workstations on physical activity and work performance. Training in the use of treadmills for different tasks may shorten the adjustment and learning period, thus enhancing the positive effect of treadmill workstations.The physical activity and performance gains can be contrasted with the cost of a treadmill workstation, about $4,000 in this experiment and around $1,000 on Amazon.com. It seems that companies ought to consider making treadmill workstations available to their sedentary employees. However, there are several limitations to our study that may restrict their applicability to other situations. The volunteers in our study were under the attention of researchers for an entire year, and their workstations looked different from those of their non-participating coworkers. Whether this has affected their behavior (walking more and working harder to justify their participation in the study) cannot be discerned from our study.Furthermore, volunteers have self-selected into the experiment, and therefore they may have walked more and worked better than other employees would have if assigned to treadmill workstations. We examined whether participants differ systematically from the rest of the company’s workforce but found few significant or meaningful differences between the two groups. We ran a logit regression with participation in the study as the dependent variable, and baseline (before the experiment began) independent variables: age, gender, education, Body Mass Index (BMI), marital status, work hours, hours of computer use, job task characteristics (routine, complexity, decision-making, teamwork), health perceptions and actions (diet, health behaviors, exercise), and time use (sports and exercise and various activities). Participants were more likely to perceive themselves as overweight; however, their BMIs, calculated on the basis of their self-reported weight and height, did not differ significantly from other survey respondents. They were more likely to be younger, better educated and less likely to work in a team. In most other ways, however, the sample of volunteers looks similar to the other survey respondents in this company. We did not find any significant effect of hours of work, computer work, task characteristics, health behaviors or time use on the choice to participate. But the fact that only about 10% of employees chose to volunteer suggests the possibility of unobserved factors that distinguishes between the two groups. Volunteers were probably more motivated to increase their physical activity at work and outside work than other employees, which is what must have moved them to take up the opportunity to use treadmill workstations. However, while motivation to increase physical activity might have been present prior to our study, it was the opportunity to use treadmill workstations that allowed participants to act on this motivation and to increase the level of their physical activity.Future research should address the effects of various contingencies that may affect the impact of treadmill workstations on physical activity and work performance. Important contingencies include the fitness level of employees and the nature of their tasks; it is possible that less physically fit employees and employees whose tasks are more cognitively complex will gain relatively more from the use of treadmill workstations. Future research should also investigate the specific behavioral channels through which working while walking affects work performance.']"
2015-12-14T00:00:00Z,Changes in Prices After an Excise Tax to Sweetened Sugar Beverages Was Implemented in Mexico: Evidence from Urban Areas,"['We estimated the effect of the SSB tax on prices in urban areas using publicly available price data applying fixed effects models unweighted and weighted according to household purchase distributions based on Nielsen purchase data. Our estimations show that prices passed along to consumers for all SSB as price changes in 2014 compared to 2013 were close to one peso per liter. We see overshifting for the CSB category as changes in prices were higher than one peso per liter. In contrast, changes in price were much lower than one peso for the NCSB. The results were also robust to other model specification: Arellano Bond Dynamic Panel Estimation and Interrupted Time Series Analysis. Overall, changes in SSB prices in urban areas from the different model specifications (weighted and unweighted) are in the range of 0.95 to 1.12 pesos per liter; price changes for CSB are between 0.96 and 1.20 and between 0.53 to 0.74 pesos per liter for NCSB.Our findings are in accordance with the economic theory that predicts that under an oligopoly market, taxes can pass through prices more or less than the amount of the tax depending on the firm’s costs, market structure and the demand. For CSBs in Mexico, where 85% of the sales are concentrated between two firms, overshifting was expected. In contrast, we see undershifting of the tax for NCSB, which has a lower market share compared to soft drinks, and higher prices and price elasticity of the demand [27], despite also being produced by only a few companies.We found differences in price changes by region and package size. Increases in prices were higher for the smallest package sizes both for CSB and NCSB, which may reflect producer’s strategies to avoid discouraging the consumption of large package beverages that are more penalized by the excise tax. These findings also highlight the importance of monitoring industry response to the tax, as the differential pass-through by package size could result in promoting purchases of larger package sizes and hence be counter-productive against the objective of the tax.We found an incomplete pass-through of the tax on prices in some regions, particularly in the South with a price increase of 7% between 2013 and 2014, one of the regions with the lowest SSB prices in the country.For CSB, weighted coefficients were slightly lower compared to unweighted results because according to Nielsen data the majority of purchases are from largest package sizes (>600ml) and our stratified analysis showed that changes in prices were lower for these sizes. It is possible that the Nielsen data may underestimate the percent of smaller package sizes due to purchases and consumption “on-the-go”. Nonetheless, our conclusions of an overshifting for CSB remain.We acknowledge that in the absence of an experimental design, our estimations rely on a before and after approach. However, in the models, we used data from 2011 to capture previous trends in prices, we adjusted for time variant factors that could be associated with changes in prices and we applied different model specifications to show the robustness of the results. In addition, descriptive analyses show that prices of untaxed beverages did not changed after the SSB tax was implemented (except for sparkling water). This is the case of still plain water and diet soft drinks whose prices were increasing long before the tax. We also recognize that the study did not take into consideration promotions of SSB in stores because the INEGI data exclude prices of commodities that have promotions. Finally, for confidentiality reasons, the price data are not displayed by stores so we could not analyze the heterogeneity on effect of the tax on prices by store.Price changes for CSB represent about 11% increase in price based on the average price in 2013 of 10.1 pesos per liter and the range of price increase in 2014 compared to 2013 estimated from the models. In contrast, given that the average price for NCSB is higher than the CSB prices (14.7 pesos per liter in 2013), the range of increase between 2013 and 2014 represented only a 3% increase.Findings from this research are similar to a study in France that found overshifting in soft drinks and incomplete pass for juices and flavored water, although in Mexico the tax passed through prices since the first month the regulation was implemented in contrast with France where the complete shifting was observed after six months[22]. Our results also confirm findings from another study in France that shows overshifting for excise taxes to soft drinks in contrast to a sale tax[24].As of our knowledge, this if the first paper that analyses the effect of the excise tax to SSB that was implemented since January 2014 using price data collected regularly by INEGI to estimate Consumer Price Index, as well as along with household purchases data. As the new regulation aims at reducing SSB consumption, evidence of an overshifting is the first condition to expect a decrease in consumption or purchases. The later would eventually depend on the price elasticity of the demand for SSB as well as market strategies from producers to promote the consumption of SSB despite the price increase such as promotions and other factors determining beverage consumption in the country.']"
2018-12-19T00:00:00Z,Human ecological and social determinants of dental caries among the Xavante Indigenous people in Central Brazil,"['Accentuated social and oral health inequities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations are observed in most world regions [56]. They often accompany historical transformations of Indigenous economies and living conditions through increased insertion in national societies and markets [56,57] and are partially attributable to such macrodeterminants as social exclusion and institutional racism, limited access to formal education, exclusion from employment opportunities, and lack of access to health services [58]. Marked oral health disparities attributed to social exclusion are similarly observed between Indigenous peoples and their respective national populations in multiple world regions [59]. In Brazil, the exclusion of certain social segments from recent oral health improvements is well substantiated [3,5,6,60]. The few studies that have addressed social determinants of dental caries among Indigenous peoples have shown associations with geographical location, physical characteristics of the house, demographics, per capita income, diet and oral cleanliness patterns, and access to health services [10,18,60].Our study assessed a diverse set of potential socioeconomic, food acquisition, and healthcare determinant factors according to a hypothetical model grounded in our previous ethnographic and public health research in the Pimentel Barbosa and Wedezé reserves. One of our central questions was how differentiated territorial and oral care histories of Xavante residing in the Pimentel Barbosa and Wedezé reserves contribute to the determination of dental caries considering national and global processes of social exclusion as they are situated and engaged locally. Building on theoretical and analytical frameworks that are inadequately addressed in previous research on oral health among Indigenous peoples, this community study of Xavante residents of Pimentel Barbosa and Wedezé Indigenous reserves, Central Brazil, provides broad insights into how multiple scales and dimensions of historically derived determinants can affect emergent oral health disparities in marginalized ethnic minorities within national contexts of recent improvements in oral health and generalized access to preventive oral health services.All three historical processes contemplated in our theoretical framework (rapid population growth, major economic change, and improved access to oral health services in recent decades) appear to be involved in the significant interrelated links contributing to dental caries determination. For example, possible biological connections between pregnancy and reduced resistance to cariogenic conditions suggest that the observed link between female sex and increased dental caries may be connected to the recent historical context of high fertility among Xavante women. Also, living in households with more favorable socioeconomic conditions and increased access to food resources was linked to fewer dental caries within a specific historical frame of marked social, political, and environmental transformation within the lifetimes of the study’s participants. Simultaneously, recent changes in local and regional health policies and access to health education are intrinsic to the observed positive associations between dental caries and greater access to oral health services and more frequent oral selfcare.Some of our results potentially lend support to established theories of health determination. For example, we observed interrelated relationships linking dental caries to different measures of household socioeconomic status, food economies, and oral health services and care that may be interpreted in terms of life course frameworks, including critical-period and accumulated effects [43]. Similarly, the expected findings of more dental caries and less frequent toothbrushing among women and caries accumulation and greater use of dental services among older individuals could be interpreted as lending support to biological and behavioral determination arguments.These interpretive tools may be useful for understanding some of the specific relationships observed in our results, but a more complete picture of oral health determination within the study population emerges by considering the larger historical frame of territorial circumscription and demographic crisis followed by rapid population increase since the 1970s, which should be considered a cause-of-cause determinant [61] of the village divisions and differentiation contributing to the differences in oral health use, selfcare, and caries status observed in this study. Even the contemporary biology of Xavante women’s and elders’ buccal environments, which conformed to epidemiological expectations, appears to be a recent phenomenon resulting from a specific historical tide of economic and social change produced through national politics over the last half century. Specifically, the Brazilian agenda of internal colonialism and economic growth by means of the settlement and assimilation of Indigenous peoples into an economically productive Brazilian society [14] was a major historical contributor to our results. The specific significant determinant pathways encountered in this study may differ from those present in other Xavante communities and in Indigenous communities pertaining to other ethnic groups with different historical, social, and health conditions. In a more general sense, our findings illustrate that Indigenous peoples’ oral health epidemiology is closely linked to the broad historical tendencies that determine social and economic relationships between minority ethnic groups and national societies.']"
2015-07-24T00:00:00Z,In Vivo Detection of Perinatal Brain Metabolite Changes in a Rabbit Model of Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR),"['We have used a rabbit model of IUGR to assess in vivo brain structural and metabolic profile changes at the time of delivery. Low birth weight in these animals was associated with smaller brain sizes, slightly lower brain temperatures during anesthesia, and metabolite profile changes in different regions of the brain parenchyma. Specifically, we found apparent lower levels of aspartate and NAA in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and higher glycine in the striatum. MRS patterns analysis further suggests that the changes in cortex are the most prevalent.The number of stillbirths and the birth weights in each group are in good agreement with the literature for this model [11,12,15], as well as the smaller brain sizes in IUGR pups [12,17]. A previous study on the same animal model of IUGR, showed predominant metabolite changes in the hemispheric regions at the time of birth, using frozen brain samples [17]. Specifically, the strongest differences between IUGR and control samples were found in asparagine (derived from aspartate), NAA, and pyroglutamic acid (a cyclic form of glutamate or glutamine), all decreased in IUGR brains [17]. These results are consistent with our data of lower apparent aspartate and NAA in both cortex and hippocampus, and slightly lower glutamate in the hippocampus.A similar rabbit model of IUGR was also used to investigate brain metabolite changes in frozen tissue sections, collected from the same brain regions that we investigated [35]. However, some methodological differences between the two models may explain some of the different results obtained. In their study, occlusion was milder (30–40%) and performed earlier in gestation (day 21); and delivery was also later (day 32), which is in accordance with the higher birth weights reported by the authors (controls +16%; IUGRs +74%) [35]. This alternative approach showed significantly higher levels of glutamate (and dopamine) in all IUGR brain regions studied, along with lower GABA in the striatum; whereas we could not detect any significant changes in GABA but noticed a slight glutamate decrease in IUGR, mostly in the hippocampus. Moreover, previous studies comparing these two animal models of IUGR showed signs of cortical brain damage mostly in our model of IUGR (higher S100β expression), as well as very distinct patterns of cell proliferation in each brain region according to the timing and degree of the ligation [12]. This could explain to some extent the metabolic differences reported by the other group [35], supporting that the effect of IUGR on brain metabolism is dependent on the brain region but also on the degree and timing of the insult, according to the maturation stage of each brain region.Our results also agree with recent clinical findings suggesting lower brain NAA levels in IUGR fetuses [9,10]. The stronger prevalence of metabolite pattern changes in the cortex region of IUGR brains is consistent with impaired neurodevelopmental performance detected in IUGR infants at 2 years of age, mostly related to frontal brain networking [36].As to the pathophysiologic explanation of our findings, the decrease of NAA (a neuronal marker and major precursor for myelin synthesis in oligodendrocytes) in the cortex and hippocampus of IUGR pups spatially correlates with the lower fractional anisotropy previously reported in this animal model at postnatal day 1 [14], which is indicative of decreased axonal packing in those regions—lower neuronal density, organization and/or myelinization. Then, the decrease of estimated aspartate levels and slight reduction of glutamate (two major excitatory neurotransmitters) would also agree with previous results with this model of impaired motor activity and olfactory function at postnatal day 1 [14], and anxiety, attention and memory problems at postnatal day 70 (pre-adolescent equivalent age) [15]: symptoms potentially related to impairments in parietal, frontal and cingulate cortex and hippocampus. Moreover, while the reduced brain/body temperatures during anesthesia agree with previous results in small animals [27,37,38], the lower cortical temperatures in the IUGR brainswould also agree with the clinical evidence of inefficient thermoregulation in low birth weight infants [39,40]. The latter observation suggests lower cortical metabolic activity, which could also explain the metabolite profile changes detected in this region. Altogether, these changes indicate impaired cellular metabolism due to sustained hypoxemia, under-nutrition, and apparent enhanced brain hypothermia in IUGR, most noticeable in products of mitochondrial aerobic metabolism in cortical and hippocampal regions (Fig 4). This is in agreement with previous results with this model [17] as well as with recent clinical findings [9,10].\n10.1371/journal.pone.0131310.g004\nFig 4\n\nMetabolic model of IUGR impairment in cortex and hippocampus regions.\nSustained hypoxemia (lower oxygen, O2) and under-nutrition (lower glucose, Glc) during IUGR lead to impaired brain metabolism, noticed in vivo as a decrease in products of aerobic metabolism (tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (2)): Asp, NAA, and Glu. Basic metabolite shuttling between neurons and glial cells according to the literature [50,51,52]. (1) Glycolysis; (3) fatty acid synthesis; alpha-ketoglutarate (αKG); glucose (Glc); oxaloacetate (OAA).\n\n\nThe different profile of metabolite changes detected in the striatum (increased estimated levels of glycine and mixed pool of myo-inositol and glycine) compared to cortex and hippocampus, could be linked to different metabolic requirements in this region, where myelinization occurs earlier than in cortical regions. Since previous studies in rabbits showed acute injuries in the basal ganglia and thalamus due to prenatal hypoxia [41], the significant increase of estimated glycine levels (~10-fold higher in the normal fetal rabbit brain than in young animals [42]) could be a response to hypoxia during IUGR. This would agree with other studies showing a cytoprotective role for glycine [43,44], specifically by inhibiting apoptosis in brain cells during glucose and oxygen deprivation [45], which could in turn explain the apparent lower brain damage in the basal ganglia compared to cortex, in this model of IUGR [12]. Moreover, our results agree with recent clinical observations of an increased mixed pool of myo-inositol and glycine (relative to total choline) in the basal ganglia of fetuses with severe congenital heart disease, which is considered a model of brain development under chronic hypoxia [46].Moreover, since the first feature objectively selected for MRS pattern classification was consistently 3.55 ppm, in the cortex region, this suggests that glycine, and/or myo-inositol, may also be altered in this region during IUGR but not readily quantifiable by model fitting. Accordingly, the estimated glycine levels were slightly elevated in IUGR cortex (+9%). Although selecting additional features for classification ultimately leads to classifier overtraining (features selected <1/3 spectral vectors available [47,48]), it is interesting to notice that those include 2.0 ppm and 3.15 ppm. While the former correlates with the NAA peak and therefore agrees with the quantitative differences estimated between groups, we found no significant metabolite differences around 3.15 ppm, i.e. estimated phenylalanine or choline compounds. Although we could detect free choline in our preliminary tissue extract NMR experiments, we did not select it for quantification (in agreement with the literature [28]) due to its much lower abundance in vivo compared with glycero-phosphocholine and phosphoryl choline, and also its overlap with phosphorylethanolamine.This study has relevant clinical implications, since the brain metabolic changes detected support previous findings in fetal brain metabolite levels during IUGR [9,10] and correlate well with associated structural changes and neurodevelopment problems. The in vivo detection of these metabolites suggests their potential role as non-invasive biomarkers for the perinatal clinical diagnosis/monitoring of IUGR and other related diseases.We acknowledge some limitations in our work. We cannot rule out possible mixed effects of anesthesia and (non-physiologic) brain hypothermia, and/or an acute response to the conditions outside the uterus in our model, which can impact brain metabolism. However, both IUGR and controls underwent the same procedures. Also, due to the small size and asymmetry of the different brain tissues, we were not able to fully position each MRS voxel within the respective tissue, although we assured their major relative contribution compared to nearby tissues. Then, selecting a shorter repetition time than in other small animals studies [28,49] was a compromise to acquire data in a timely manner, due to the difficulty in keeping newborn rabbits anesthetized for long periods. Although this induced some T1 saturation in our signals, the total creatine levels were similar to those obtained ex vivo; and most importantly, this should not affect the comparison between IUGR and controls. Moreover, the model basis sets for macromolecule fitting were taken from standard references and visual inspection of our data. Improving this performance would required metabolite suppression techniques [28], which were not available in our case. Still, no significant differences were detected in estimated macromolecule (or mobile lipid) contributions between IUGR and controls.The stronger aspects of this work rely on the well characterized animal model of IUGR used that reproduces many clinical features of this disease [12,13], as well as the in vivo assessment of brain metabolite changes at the time of birth, which complements previous studies post-mortem with this model [17,35]. We have used MRS with high spatial resolution (voxel volume ~10 μl) and an echo time about 2-fold shorter than typically available in the clinic (≥20 ms). Thus, by carefully positioning the newborns in the animal holder and keeping them stably anesthetized (not trivial with newborn rabbits), we acquired good quality MRS data that enable a timely detection of low concentrated brain metabolites in different brain regions, reaching statistical significances with a relatively small animal cohort. Additionally, we used two independent approaches for MRS analysis, based on metabolite quantification and spectral pattern classification. This re-enforced our results since the two techniques are complementary, and the stronger metabolite differences estimated between groups do not necessarily represent the best spectral pattern features for classification.To conclude, a well established animal model of IUGR showed differential metabolic profile changes in cortical and subcortical brain regions, with the most prevalent changes noticed in the cortex. This is consistent with postnatal neurobehavioral impairments reported in children and provides insight to the origin of the MRS changes recently reported in small fetuses at term. Future studies with this animal model of IUGR, or others, should investigate the longitudinal brain metabolic changes that parallel structural alterations, to help understanding the extent of IUGR from a biochemical point of view and provide additional biomarkers for its detection at different stages and/or monitor response to therapy.']"
2018-05-17T00:00:00Z,Maternal human telomerase reverse transcriptase variants are associated with preterm labor and preterm premature rupture of membranes,"['Feto-maternal tissue senescence is a physiological factor associated with term parturition in humans. Premature and pathologic senescence activation in response to various pregnancy-associated risk factors can contribute to preterm labor and delivery.[25] Multitudes of risk factors have been linked to premature senescence activation; mainly oxidative stress inducing factors like infection/inflammation,[32–33] obesity,[34–35] nutritional factors,[36–37] and behavioral risks.[38–39] Oxidative stress induced by these risk factors can accelerate telomere attrition causing early aging and inflammation contributing to either PTL or pPROM. Genetic variation in maternal or fetal telomerase gene may also contribute to this process in the absence of specific risk factors, or an interaction between the two may also predispose to adverse pregnancy outcome. This study examined the existence of any genetic predisposition to PTL and/or pPROM through variations in the telomerase gene.We report that maternal hTERT SNP rs2853690 was significantly associated with both PTL (aOR 2.24) and pPROM (aOR 7.54). Located in the non-coding region near the 3 prime end, the functional role of this SNP is unclear. This SNP is not in obvious linkage disequilibrium with any other variants in hTERT (r2 < 0.36 with all other SNPs in the gene) as determined from 1000 Genomes Project data. We found no significant associations between any of the analyzed fetal hTERT SNPs and PTL or pPROM.The major strength of our study was that the samples came from an established biobank with well-defined phenotypes and well-characterized race and ethnicity. Quality control measures were used to ensure that only subjects with high quality genotyping and only SNPs with high genotyping efficiency were included. Additionally, we analyzed both maternal and newborn samples, allowing us to investigate both the maternal and fetal contributions to risk of preterm birth. Our candidate gene, hTERT, has a biologically plausible role in the mechanisms of PTL and pPROM. And finally, a significant strength of our study is that we adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction, minimizing the risk that the association we found was due to type I error.The study was limited by small sample sizes of cases, especially pPROM. Also, the findings may not be applicable to all populations because our study was restricted to Caucasians. Of interest, the risk allele (A) is at least twice as common in African ancestry populations as compared to European populations (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/), the former being at higher risk for PTL and pPROM).[40,41] However, seemingly inconsistent results are that germline telomere length appears to be longer in African individuals that those of European descent.[30] One explanation for this could be that specific genetic predispositions vary between races/ethnicities. A replication of our data in multiple independent cohorts, particularly in one that includes people of African descent, is essential prior to projecting the usefulness of this SNP as a genetic marker of high risk pregnancy. Another limitation of this study is that we have examined only SNPs in the hTERT gene and their association with PTB and pPROM. Other genetic and epigenetic variations in the hTERT gene may also contribute to functional alterations to hTERT activity or levels, contributing to adverse pregnancy outcomes.Telomerase’s role in uterine and feto-maternal tissues is as area of active research. In women with recurrent implantation failure, expression of endometrial telomerase was enhanced during the implantation window.[42] In pregnancy, it has been shown that hTERT expression in the chorion is increased in the first trimester compared the second and third trimesters.[43] Similarly, telomerase activity level has been shown to be significantly higher in the first trimester in chorionic villi samples.[44] A study of human fetal tissues confirms the same pattern of decreasing telomere length and decreasing telomerase expression across the first trimester.[45]Alterations in telomerase expression/activity have been shown to be associated with pathologic pregnancy states. While increased hTERT expression was noted in chorion cells of preeclamptic patients,[43] decreased telomerase activity has been observed in trophoblasts and placental biopsies from pregnancies affected by intrauterine growth restriction.[46–47] A study of growth discordant twins showed a tendency toward reduced telomerase activity in placental trophoblasts of the smaller twin.[48] While the results are not consistent, they may suggest a link between altered telomerase expression and/or activity and premature aging of fetal tissue leading to placental insufficiency and growth restriction.In our continued work on telomerase’s role in preterm birth, our lab has subsequently performed hTERT gene activity and expression studies. We have found that telomerase has no activity in fetal membranes in the second and third trimesters, nor is it expressed in fetal membranes from either term or preterm placenta, including laboring and non-laboring samples. The lack of telomerase expression and activity in fetal membranes could explain why we see no association between infant genetic variation in hTERT and PTL or pPROM in this study. The lack of expression is also suggestive of unhindered telomere reduction to promote the natural progression of senescence that will eventually result in parturition. This study identifies a biologically plausible candidate gene for replicative studies and contributes to the growing evidence that replicative senescence plays a role in maternal-fetal signaling of parturition.']"
2017-03-22T00:00:00Z,Practising pastoralism in an agricultural environment: An isotopic analysis of the impact of the Hunnic incursions on Pannonian populations,"['The isotopic evidence reveals a picture of great dietary variability, both within populations and over individuals’ lifetimes. The patterns at all sites suggest subsistence strategies that include medium to high animal protein consumption with little evidence for a significant contribution of aquatic resources. All populations relied to great extent on C4 plants, most likely millet. Within each population, diet was heterogeneous, with significant variations in terms of animal protein and C3 and C4 plant consumption. High levels of intra-population and individual variability suggest that populations made use of a range of subsistence strategies, with many individuals exhibiting significant changes over their lifetimes.It is therefore likely that groups and individuals switched between subsistence strategies, often quite rapidly. This may have been a response to a period of warfare and instability in the frontier zones, as recorded in historical sources. Certainly agricultural diversification is a safer strategy than reliance on monoculture in uncertain economic times. Conversely, switching of subsistence strategies may have been a proactive choice. Most pastoralists rely on some form of agriculture, either by engaging in it themselves or through close interaction with agricultural populations, and nomadic groups can be mobile for part of a year or move between long-established locations. Such a fluid approach to apparently very different subsistence strategies has been documented ethnographically (e.g. [100, 101, 102]), but also archaeologically [14].The burial evidence—grave construction and grave goods—from the four cemeteries within Pannonia is largely in keeping with wider developments in middle and lower Danubian burial practice in the fifth century [63, 103]. There is no evidence for great social disruption or economic deprivation. Graves were commonly well-constructed and fairly well-furnished. The cemetery at Keszthely was associated with the late Roman fortification, but self-contained and at some distance from it [57]. In Győr the graves were located within the former Roman vicus following its abandonment [67]. Hács-Béndekpuszta and Mözs, on the other hand, were newly established, though a number of graves at Mözs were brick-lined, in the late Roman tradition. Similarly, the burial evidence at Szolnok-Szanda is in keeping with local practices [73]. While some grave goods display long-distance connections to the Pontic regions (e.g. shoe buckles in Mözs, grave 11), but also to west-central Europe (e.g. the brooches in Keszthely, grave 10, and Hács, graves 19 and 20 with a parallel in south-west Germany), the funerary context does not suggest that particular individuals were considered foreigners or outsiders. Nor are individuals with outlying isotopic data marked out as different in their burials. The funerary evidence thus suggests that the individuals or groups that newly arrived in the areas where they were buried were largely part of the hybridised environment of late antique Pannonia and the plains beyond the frontier rather than outsiders that arrived from regions as far as central Asia, as has been suggested [104]. Instead, it is likely that the steppe environments of the Carpathian basin and the Pontic littoral generated the phenomenon of the Huns locally. The archaeological and isotopic evidence presented here therefore does not identify ‘Huns’ as a distinct ethnic group. Instead it reveals the impact of nomadic-pastoralist groups on the populations of the Carpathian basin.The environment of the Carpathian basin was a mosaic of steppe, open forests and agricultural land. This makes it likely that the inhabitants would have relied on both agriculture and pastoralism to suit their needs. Interestingly this was the case at the sites within late Roman Pannonia, as well as in Szolnok, in the Great Hungarian Plain, the ecological region most likely to support large-scale animal herding. At Keszthely, Hács and Győr, we may have evidence of fairly transient populations. The cemetery at Mözs is much larger than the sub-sample included in this study and has a large associated settlement. Nevertheless, it is possible that a number of those buried there had not settled there long-term. At Szolnok, we have no associated settlement. Chronologically it spans the fifth and sixth centuries, a longer period than the other sites. Its size and period of use suggests a fairly large, relatively stable population. Here it may be possible that some individuals engaged in pastoralism within a mostly sedentary population.While written accounts of the last century of the Roman empire may document particular convulsions of violence, they are largely silent on the cooperation and coexistence of people living in the frontier zone. Our new isotopic evidence shows that populations along the late Roman frontier in Hungary adopted a highly flexible approach to subsistence, in keeping with high levels of hybridity evident in burial practice. Farming and animal herding were not fundamentally opposed to each other, but mutually beneficial strategies that were not limited to particular ethnic groups. Nomadic-pastoralist groups may have switched to smaller herds and more farming, and, conversely, local populations may have integrated with a new economic system based on animal herding, and these changes could happen over the course of a person’s life. The influx of nomadic populations into east-central Europe in the fifth century AD may have caused enormous political upheaval and documented episodes of violence, but isotopic evidence shows people finding strategies to mitigate and perhaps even to benefit from these changes by modifying their subsistence economies.']"
2016-03-15T00:00:00Z,Soft Regulation with Crowd Recommendation: Coordinating Self-Interested Agents in Sociotechnical Systems under Imperfect Information,"['We propose a soft regulation framework for coordinating multi-agent systems. In this setting, the regulator’s role is to help agents learn, understand, and optimize an unknown process without interrupting normal operations. The essence of this mechanism is to take guided decisions by updating actions using the map x i + = ( 1 - β i ) x ¯ i + β i u, where x ¯ i is the i-th agent’s own optimized decision and u is the regulator’s crowd recommendation. Self-interested agents have the freedom to choose to partially accept the regulator’s recommendation. Soft regulation provides a more balanced coordination: Unlike hard regulation, it does not force the agents; this creates a collective learning environment and avoids possibly erroneous mandates. On the other hand, a soft regulatory system is not under-regulated or uncoupled. The exploration of some agents benefits others. Useful information is shared indirectly instead of being wasted in an asocial learning environment.We notice the efficiency of soft regulation is impacted by the following factors:\n\nPopulation: Because of noise, recommendation is subject to uncertainty. However, when n ≫ 1, the variance becomes negligible, and the recommendation becomes deterministic (very close to mean) and accurate. This dependence on population size is intuitive: The information aggregated from a large population should be more useful compared to the one from a small population.\n\n\nProcess: We have proved that soft regulation with crowd recommendation preserves optimality. The advantage of the mechanism, however, is especially pronounced when the system is very noisy and the payoff function is very sensitive. A rule of thumb for the agents would be when a large sensitivity of the process is observed (either because of high noise or large curvature), the agents may be better off relying on the recommendation. Uncertainty drives the system towards cooperation. Soft regulation can potentially stabilize an open loop unstable process. This result also provides some insights on the wisdom of crowds. For example, the average performance can outperform the best individual when the system is very uncertain. In that sense, the “expert” knowledge may not be as useful in an emerging industry as the collective wisdom.\n\n\nAgent confidence level: From the mathematical proofs and simulation evidence, we conclude that the best confidence level should be large but not too close to 100%. This is especially true when the system is very noisy and the process is very sensitive. In such setting, agents should put a substantial amount of trust on the regulator’s recommendations. Because of the trade-off between consensus and efficiency, in the early stage of soft regulation, the confidence level should be kept low for recommendation to quickly converge. As time proceeds, agents can be more and more confident regarding the recommendation.\n\nDespite the name, soft regulation has applications beyond industrial regulation. The soft regulator module, i.e., x i + = ( 1 - β i ) x ¯ i + β i u, can be integrated in different control systems and problem-solving scenarios (see Table 3). We only analyze a specific and stylized model in this paper to illustrate the efficacy of the mechanism. In practice, soft regulation should be implemented and modified in a case by case manner. For example, when the regulator can obtain more information other than the average action, it is entirely reasonable to formulate a better recommendation based on the richer information set such as trends, histograms, etc. The agents, instead of adjusting confidence level via the method proposed in this paper, can also explore and compare utilities (on a much slower timescale) to adapt new confidence levels. For a large population where centralized information collection is impractical, soft regulation might be plausible on a peer-to-peer basis. All these possibilities will be explored and analyzed in future work.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0150343.t003\nTable 3\n\nSoft regulation applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n→\nUtility\n\n\n\n\nhealth behavior:e.g., sleep habit, exercise frequency, diet, etc.\n→\nhealth conditione.g., sleep quality, BMI, etc.\n\n\noperating condition:e.g., T, P, feed ratio, flow rate, catalyst, etc.\n→\nyielde.g., production rate, etc.\n\n\nworkplace environment:e.g., indoor temperature, lighting, etc.\n→\nproductivitye.g., profitability, etc.\n\n\ninfrastructure planning:e.g., traffic light control, hospital resource, budget allocation, etc.\n→\nefficiencye.g., congestion time, etc.\n\n\n\n\nThe medical domain is another applicable area of soft regulation. Powered by mobile phones and wearables, researchers can now collect timely mass medical data (via Apple’s ResearchKit [32] for example). Soft regulation is suitable in this scenario because medical research satisfies all three features, i.e., imperfect information (unknown relationships between patient behaviors and health conditions), weak interaction (one patient’s condition is not affected by another’s), and bounded rationality (patients always wish to improve their own health, however, have limited information). In addition, thanks to the convenience of mobile devices, we expect good participation rate. A large population size further ensures the accuracy of recommendation. Patients can optimize their own health while contributing to medical research. Even if patients do not want to optimize themselves, medical researchers may implement the soft regulation module to do that based on data collected locally. The confidence level can also be explicitly controlled by the service provider. Soft regulation in this setting becomes a crowdsourcing framework. The results in this paper are expected to hold.This work also has some implications other than our central arguments on control and regulation. It reinforces the idea that an averaged opinion can accurately predict under uncertainty, i.e., the wisdom of crowds, given the population is large, independent, and relevant. Unlike conventional takes on the wisdom of crowds, soft regulation does not stop at collecting average information but also feeds it back to the system. This dynamical mechanism suggests more flexible scenarios and applications.']"
2015-11-16T00:00:00Z,Impaired Glucose Tolerance or Newly Diagnosed Diabetes Mellitus Diagnosed during Admission Adversely Affects Prognosis after Myocardial Infarction: An Observational Study,"['Our study confirms that (1) a large proportion of patients without preexisting diabetes mellitus admitted with MI have new DM and IGT that would remain undiagnosed on FPG only, (2) the incidence of MACE after MI progressively increases from the patients with NGT to NDM, (3) MACE-free survival in these patients is worse not only with NDM but also with IGT and (4) both NDM and IGT are strong predictors of MACE.It is well recognized that the vascular risk associated with glucometabolic disorders appear early in the course of the disease spectrum, and years ahead of the development of diabetes [28]. The high prevalence rate of IGT in our study is in keeping with this and suggests that risk of MI extends to patients with pre-diabetic conditions as well.This is by far the largest study assessing the effect of newly diagnosed AGT on prognosis after MI. Most previous studies [15–17] recruited fewer patients before the widespread use of statins, clopidogrel and drug eluting stents. The effect of IGT on prognosis remained unclear in previous studies. Although both the GAMI group [1, 15] and Tamita et al [16] suggest the independent effect of AGT on MACE, neither study report the adjusted hazard of MACE in patients with IGT and NDM separately. Thus it is unclear whether IGT affected prognosis in these studies. Kitada et al [17] reported similar MACE rates in the NGT and IGT groups with higher MACE rates in NDM. MACE predominantly consisted of revascularisation for restenosis and de novo lesions with very few cardiovascular events. Euro Heart Survey [4] reported prognosis in 2515 non-diabetic patients with CAD, included 1029 with MI classified based on OGTT. Within the whole population, NDM but not IGT independently increased the risk of death but not the other end-points. As MACE in the MI patients has not been published separately, it is impossible to infer the prognostic effect of the glucometabolic states in these patients from this study. Our study clearly demonstrates that not only NDM but also IGT independently adversely affects prognosis after MI. This study confirms previous reports [1, 16, 27, 29] that FPG alone underestimates the prevalence of abnormal glucometabolic state. About 90% of our patients were diagnosed normal by FPG only and 84% of patients with AGT had normal FPG. In the DECODE study, about 37% of NDM diagnosed on OGTT were normal on FPG criteria [27]. In the GAMI population [1], 10% had NDM on FPG criteria compared to 31% on OGTT criteria. The reliability of pre-discharge OGTT in reflecting “true” glucometabolic state may be dependent on its timing in relation to the cardiac event and the severity of the event itself. The pre-discharge glucometabolic category may [19, 20, 29] or may not [30, 31] change in the medium to long term in these patients. Glucometabolic categories based on OGTT done within 24 hours of a STEMI changed in 46% patients at 3 months post-discharge [29]. Glucometabolic abnormality seems to be overestimated within the first 24 hours after STEMI [19, 29]. However, OGTT done at or after 5 days seems to reliably predict long term glucometabolic state [30, 31]. This may be related to the subsidence of the acute responses between 2–5 days with no further decrease thereafter [31]. Hage et al [32] suggested a somewhat better reproducibility of OGTT in patients with subendocardial than transmural infarction. All our patients had the OGTT at least three days (37% ≥ day 4) after the index event. This makes it likely that the results would reliably predict long term glucometabolic state. Irrespective of its relation to long term glucometabolic status, pre-charge OGTT based classification independently predicted prognosis in our post-MI patients.While the measurement of HbA1c would have improved the understanding of the glucometabolic status of these patients, especially with regard to the role of stress induced hyperglycaemia in the prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance; this was not available for use at our center on a routine basis. Furthermore, while HbA1c identifies patients with NDM, it has limited use in the identification of patients with intermediate hyperglycaemia or IGT. Recent studies have shown an increased incidence of adverse events in non-diabetic post MI patients with elevated HbA1c, suggesting that the underlying mechanism is not entirely a stress mediated response [28]. Furthermore, the purpose of the study was to ascertain the prognostic risk of post challenge hyperglycaemia in patients following acute MI, irrespective of the underlying pathophysiology.There are some differences in baseline characteristics across the three groups, which could have influenced the results. Patients with IGT and NDM were older than the patients in NGT group, which was noted to be statistically significant. Although we have adjusted for this in the cox proportional hazard regression model and while it is unlikely to explain the increased incidence of adverse events in the IGT and NDM group; it is difficult to be certain if there any residual confounding in the final result. Similar baseline variation, especially in age, between NGT and AGT has been noted in other similar studies as well [15, 19].The MACE rates in our study are similar to those previously reported [15–17, 19]. Contrary to some [16, 17], our study suggests that clinical events rather non-target vessel revascularisation may predominate MACE in post-MI patients newly diagnosed with IGT or DM. The management of our patients matched contemporary published data [4, 15]. The revascularisation rate was similar to the GRACE registry [32]. Compared to the EHS-ACS II survey [33], PCI rates were lower in STEMI, as most patients were thrombolysed, but similar in NSTEMI patients.In the absence of robust evidence for prognostic, benefits of intensive glycaemic control [34], none of our patients underwent in- hospital intensive glucose lowering therapy. They were not discharged on hypoglycaemic agents due to the uncertainty whether the dysglycaemia detected pre-discharge truly reflected the “true” glucometabolic status. All IGT and NDM patients were advised lifestyle modification including diet, physical activity and were referred to the cardiac rehabilitation service. They were also referred to the diabetologists for appropriate management that was overseen by them as out-patients.']"
2015-11-18T00:00:00Z,Food Security Monitoring via Mobile Data Collection and Remote Sensing: Results from the Central African Republic,"['Our study with MSF in the Central African Republic showed that, with appropriate training of local staff, it is possible to substantially increase the efficiency of food security assessments. This was realized through the straightforward adaptation of an Android-based app named SATIDA COLLECT to local conditions (e. g. questions related to people’s diets specific to this region), a quick coverage of large areas, as well as the automated upload of the data collected into a database for advanced processing and data sharing. Despite the lack of a random sampling strategy, which would naturally increase the representativeness of the collected data, our key findings indicate that in May 2015 the interviewed households consumed 0.9 meals per day on average, while the average household size was more than nine people. Despite this fact, children between six and 59 months, the most vulnerable group, were not malnourished. From a total of 923 family members in the assessment 92 had joined the households during the last six months. Again, the movement of IDPs seems to be strongly related to volatile conflict in more Southern regions.Regarding the process of data collection, in particular, the selection and training of the local staff with respect to the understanding of all questions and logical relationships is crucial. If, for instance, the number of reported births during the last six months is zero while there is one child under the age of six months, this issue must be clarified or corrected (e. g. by repeating the question). In the face of a highly volatile environment due to the ubiquity of armed rebel forces, we strongly recommend to coordinate all activities in the field with the corresponding authorities and heads of districts to minimize any kind of suspicion related to the smart phones.Based on our experience with the extended questionnaire, one assessment (including the walk from house to house) takes around 20 minutes, which would result in 54 assessments per day, 270 per week (assuming six working hours/day). This way it should easily be possible to cover a representative number of households in Kabo or any other comparable village every week. In any case we suggest to apply a simple, but comprehensible random sampling technique. This strategy requires an early announcement so that people stay at home from agricultural activities and school for as little time as possible.Analyzing the coupling between socio-economic information, representing inter alia the impact of droughts, and environmental anomalies measured via satellite-derived information, representing drought risk, is important. Also if the current crisis is caused by violent conflict rather than climatic shocks, the impact of droughts on people’s livelihoods can put the already vulnerable system under severe additional pressure, potentially fueling insurgent activities. Remote sensing helps to understand the perennial development of food crises, to relate current to past conditions and to use the potential forecasting capability of environmental information in regions whose food security levels are susceptible to climatic shocks. In the case of Kabo, satellite-derived information about rainfall/soil moisture conditions (Figs 4 and 5) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (Fig 6) confirmed that the food insecurity situation 2013/2014 was related to violent conflicts rather than to a climatic shock. We strongly advise to consider the full range of satellite-derived information in the early warning phase of drought-induced food insecurity, ranging from rainfall and soil moisture to evapotranspiration and vegetation-based indicators. In particular with regard to soil moisture we will soon be able to provide observations at a far higher spatial resolution than 0.25 degrees via the European “Sentinel” mission or NASA’s SMAP (Soil Moisture Active/Passive). Creating internal capacities within aid organizations is therefore not enough, because large data volumes and tailored products require dedicated hardware and expertise. Therefore, partnerships between the research community and stakeholders who can apply these solutions in the field are essential. Furthermore, local data collection can also be beneficial for the validation of satellite-derived information, for instance via the use of low-cost soil moisture sensors that transmit the recorded data via a Bluetooth connection.While the test of SATIDA COLLECT focused on early warning related to food insecurity, discussions with MSF staff lead to additional applications. SATIDA COLLECT can easily be adapted to new applications as outlined in section 2.2. All of them have in common that time and human resources can be saved, as no digitization of paper surveys is needed. In this way, also errors during the process of digitization can be avoided. Possible applications include:\n-the evaluation of vaccination efforts (e. g. assessing households that did or did not participate in the vaccination campaign)\n-the evaluation of water, sanitation and health (WASH) and food security conditions in refugee camps (ideally one high resolution satellite image is available to number the tents prior to the evaluation)\n-replacing the written weekly incidence report (WIR) via standardized forms\n-any other application that requires simple, quick and standardized digitization of information\nIn addition to the basic version of SATIDA COLLECT for assessments on household-level, we developed three other versions within the same application. One version concentrates on village-level assessments and related price developments of staple food. Bumper harvests often lead to a reduction in commodity prices, which in turn results in limited planting that is even more susceptible to climatic shocks [28]. Another version focuses on the admissions to the Inpatient and Ambulatory Therapeutic Feeding Centre (ITFC, ATFC), as well as on widespread diseases (malaria, diarrhea, respiratory infections, measles), comparing current numbers to a reference period in the previous year. All versions will soon be available on the Google Play store free of charge.In summary, SATIDA COLLECT seems to be the most flexible, efficient and user-friendly data collection tool that MSF have used so far. It is the only tool that facilitates a direct link to satellite-derived information about drought risk. If used for regular assessments, SATIDA COLLECT can help to assess the current levels of food insecurity more realistically and to identify which critical thresholds in satellite-derived datasets and indicators reflect actual drought impacts. Finally, the complementary use of information from satellites and SATIDA COLLECT can support the translation of early warnings into action, reducing the risk of false alarms and strengthening overall disaster preparedness.']"
2017-06-30T00:00:00Z,Sample size determination for a specific region in multiregional clinical trials with multiple co-primary endpoints,"['The aim of an MRCT is to show the efficacy of a drug in various global regions, and simultaneously to evaluate the possibility of applying the overall trial results to each region. However, in MRCTs sponsors are challenged by how to demonstrate consistency between a specific region and the overall results. In this paper, three criteria have been established to assess the similarity between a specific region and the overall regions in an MRCT with multiple co-primary endpoints. Regulators and sponsors can easily adopt these criteria to conduct statistical assessments of the consistency of treatment effects between the specific region and the entire trial, and consequently to help registration of the new drug in the specific region.On the other hand, the 11th Q&A for ICH E5 states, “It may be desirable in certain situations to achieve the goal of bridging by conducting a multi-regional trial under a common protocol that includes sufficient numbers of patients from each of multiple regions to reach a conclusion about the effect of the drug in all regions.” Therefore, the sample size determination for each region is another challenge for regulators and sponsors. With the three criteria we established, the sample size required for a specific region can easily be determined so that there is a high probability of observing a consistent trend in treatment effect between the specific region and the entire MRCT. In this paper, we do not particularly recommend any criterion for evaluating the consistency of treatment effects between the entire region and the specific region.Although our approach is easy to use, the selection of the magnitude γi’s consistency trend raises an important issue. In this regard, the Japanese guidance suggests that the magnitude be 0.5 or greater for the first criterion when the number of primary endpoints for the MRCT is only one. Our suggestion is that the determination of γi should be discussed between the regulatory agency in the specific region and the trial sponsor. Most importantly, all differences in race, diet, environment, culture, and medical practice among regions should be considered.It should be noted that, in our approach, the sample size calculation for the specific region did not have a closed-form expression. For conducting an MRCT with only one primary endpoint, Ikeda and Bretz [23] discussed the methods proposed in the Japanese regulatory guidance document and derived closed-form expressions for the resulting probabilities, which required the evaluation of multivariate normal or t probabilities between the overall effect and the effect in Japan. In addition, they proposed a different method of calculating the probability of observing a consistent trend based on Method 1 in the Japanese regulatory guidance. Ikeda and Bretz’s work is worthy of being extended to the MRCT with multiple co-primary endpoints.When more than one primary endpoint is viewed as important in a clinical trial, a decision must be made as to whether it is desirable to evaluate the joint effects on at least one or even all of the endpoints. This decision defines the alternative hypothesis to be tested and provides a framework for trial design. This article discusses only the former situation, where a trial is designed to evaluate the joint effects of a new treatment compared to any control treatment on all of the primary endpoints as seen in AD clinical trials. On the other hand, the latter situation—i.e., designing the trial to evaluate an effect on at least one of the primary endpoints is referred to as “multiple primary endpoints” (Offen et al. [15])—and many methods for dealing with such multiple primary endpoints have been proposed (e.g., see the extensive references in Dmitrienko et al [24]). Similarly, as in multiple co-primary endpoints, the power for detecting an effect on at least one endpoint—which is called “disjunctive power” (Senn and Bretz [19]) or “minimal power” (Westfall et al. [20]))—can be defined and extended.Another issue we want to point out is that in this paper, it is assumed that the outcome variances are known for the sample size calculation. In actual practice, the outcome variances are not known and should be estimated from some data. In fact, extensive literature of results of similar trials may exist, and thus the variability associated with the primary endpoints can also be found in literature. For methods for unknown variance, the major change is that the power function will be evaluated based on a non-central multivariate t-distribution. For clinical trials with multiple co-primary endpoints, Sozu et al. [18] discussed a method for the unknown variance case and showed that the calculated sample size is nearly equivalent to that for the known variance in the setting of 80% or 90% power at 2.5% significance level for one-sided test. They showed that the sample size per group calculated using the method based on the unknown variance needs generally one more subject than that using the method based on the known variance. This is a very similar result observed as in a single primary endpoint case. Therefore, sample size calculation based on a known variance provides a reasonable approximation for the unknown variances case.Similarly, the correlation is usually unknown and thus must be estimated by (1) using data from pilot studies or proceeding clinical trials (e.g., Phase II trials), or by (2) borrowing information from external existing data when incorporating correlation into sample size calculation. In some disease areas, the correlations among the endpoints have been known. For example, Offen et al. [15] provides a list of known disease are as that the regulatory agency requires for co-primary endpoints when evaluating the effects of a new treatment; the list includes possible correlations among endpoints for each disease area.The proposed criteria can be extended from one to multiple regions. For example, after the MRCT has demonstrated a statistically significant overall treatment effect, we can bridge the results of the MRCT to all regions if\n\n\n\n\nDi1>γkiD1,…,DiK>γKiDKfor\xa00<γki<1,\u2009i=1,…,M,\xa0k=1,…,\xa0K.\n\n\n\nHere γki represents the threshold of consistency trend for the kth endpoint in the ithregion. Our research work here assumes that the effect size for each co-primary endpoint and the correlations among endpoints are both uniform across regions. Since MRCTs recruit subjects from many countries around the world, it might be expected that there is a difference in treatment effect or in correlations among endpoints due to regional difference (e.g., ethnic difference).Thus, the sample size calculation for MRCTs based on the assumption that the effect size for each co-primary endpoint and the correlations among endpoints are uniform across regions might be impractical. Future work is being pursued to address this issue.']"
2017-07-19T00:00:00Z,Heterogeneity of p53 dependent genomic responses following ethanol exposure in a developmental mouse model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder,"['In general, a more profuse cell death response to a binge ethanol exposure was expected based on previous literature [43]. Nonetheless, we did observe a significant increase in apoptosis upon ethanol exposure. Moreover, we consistently found that the absence of p53 in C57BL6 mice did not protect against apoptosis in the brain in the specific areas we examined that have been shown to be particularly vulnerable to ethanol exposure. These results are supported by findings in Ghosh and colleagues [28] and suggests that pro-apoptotic signaling is occurring via a p53-independent pathway.Our results indicate that p53 is likely to be involved in cell cycle-related gene expression changes in layers 5 and 6 of the somatosensory cortex as well as both the CA1 and DG of the hippocampus, the latter of which is a site of continual neurogenesis in postnatal mice. There is evidence from previous studies that p53 can play a role in differentiation and cell division in neuronal stem cell cultures [44]. In the somatosensory cortex, the p53 cell cycle signaling changes we observed may be occurring in neurons but we cannot discount that it may also be occurring in non-neuronal cell populations such as microglia and other cell types. Nonetheless, the fact that ethanol causes significant changes in cell cycle genes means it impacts both neurogenesis and gliogenesis, leading to devastating ramifications on brain circuitry formation and function.The present study has identified that p53 is engaged in neurodevelopmental signaling pathways in all subregions interrogated except layer 4 of the somatosensory cortex. Changing neuronal projections in the early postnatal brain can have severe consequences as this is a particular time when synaptic connections are refined, which sets the foundation for functional brain activity throughout life [45]. Previous alcohol research has shown that there are physical changes in neuronal processes and neuronal spine densities [46] (reviewed in [4]). Moreover, decreases in spine density following ethanol exposure correlate with decreased spatial memory (reviewed in [4]). Thus, the observed p53 dependent changes in synaptic transcripts and cell cycle transcripts in the brain may collectively impair normal brain maturation and lead to the intellectual disability that is well established as a possible consequence of FASD.Our results also highlight a relatively new category of p53 dependent signaling responses following ethanol exposure that relate to effects on fatty acid (butanoate in particular) and ketone body metabolism. This was made evident by expression changes in Butanoate Metabolism and Synthesis and Degradation of Ketone Bodies pathways. Although we did not examine the biochemical mechanisms in this study, alcohol can contribute to a multitude of oxidation reactions, and to fatty acid synthesis in the brain [47]. Moreover, p53 has also been implicated in fatty acid transport [48–49] (reviewed in [30]). Previous research has shown that changes in proteins that transport ketone bodies (produced from fatty acids) are associated with epilepsy and synaptic changes [50]. Coincidently, people with FASD have a high-comorbidity of epilepsy [51] (reviewed in [4]). In fact, efforts to control seizures using a ketone rich diet show some clinical benefit, and blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels (an example of an oxidized ketone body) correlate with the degree of seizure control [52]. In addition fatty acid accumulation in a newborn’s meconium is a marker of ethanol exposure in second or third trimester of development [53].Considering these findings, we propose a new model of the role of p53 following ethanol exposure in the developing brain. This model posits that there are developmental changes in p53 signaling which in turn cause a detrimental change in synaptic function or structure, and lead to long term deficits in intellectual and behavioral function. Furthermore, the mechanism for this effect may be related to a change in fatty acid and ketone body metabolism, although further research will be needed to test this possibility.Finally, we wish to comment on the potential relevance of our findings using a third-trimester equivalent binge drinking model for human exposures. Few studies are available to provide precise statistics regarding the 2nd and 3rd trimester alcohol consumption patterns in women, and self-reported rates differ considerably in different countries. Nonetheless, there are strong indications that such drinking patterns pose a significant public health risk. For example, a recent study of 1577 Australian women found that almost half of the women who drank prior to pregnancy (46%) continued their weekly or binge drinking patterns into pregnancy, while 40% reduced their consumption and 14% stopped drinking completely [54]. Moreover, among the women who only binge drank prior to pregnancy, 55% were more likely to continue this pattern rather than reduce drinking (29%), and among the combined weekly and binge drinking group 61% continued to binge and 47% continued weekly drinking throughout their pregnancy. In the US, a study of 992 women in the California Pregnancy Cohort by Feldman and colleagues [55] reported that 89% of women drank alcohol during their 1st trimester, 40% drank during their 2nd trimester and 31% drank during their 3rd trimester. Furthermore, 25% of these women reported at least 1 binge drinking episode during their first trimester, which dropped to 8.5% during their 2nd trimester and 4% during their 3rd trimester. These numbers are consistent with more recent studies in the US involving much larger surveys of more than 311,000 women in the 2002–2009 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) dataset whose drinking patterns prior to pregnancy and during the last trimester of pregnancy were compared [56]. In that study, almost half of the surveyed women (49.4%) consumed alcohol before pregnancy, and among these women, 6.4% reported no reduction in drinking into their 3rd trimester, 6.6% reported some reduction of their drinking, and the remaining 87% reported that they stopped drinking altogether as of their 3rd trimester. Thus, even in this large US sample, 13% of women continued to drink through their 3rd trimester, although the percentage who binge drank is likely much smaller (in the 2–4% range based on the Feldman study). Consequently, the findings from our study, which was based on a single binge day exposure, holds potential relevance for at least 2–13% of pregnancies in the US alone.']"
2019-08-14T00:00:00Z,Petrosal morphology and cochlear function in Mesozoic stem therians,"['The descriptions and discussion provided here highlight the phylogenetically heterogeneous nature of stem therian petrosal evolution throughout the Mesozoic. The minimal age for the the successive nodes formed by Priacodon, the Höövör petrosals, and therians is currently dated as Early and Middle Jurassic, respectively (determined by the eutriconodontan Argentoconodon [180] and the therian Juramaia [181]); despite major differences in morphology, the internodal age difference is only on the order of 10–15 MY. The approximately 50 million year duration separating the stratigraphic provenance of the Upper Jurassic Priacodon and Lower Cretaceous Höövör specimens focused on here is simply the result of taxon sampling, illustrating the first known acquisitions of several derived internal labyrinthine features along the backbone of therian evolution. Even before the advent of the dorsoventral cochlear coiling characteristic of modern crown therians and their cladotherian relatives, both Priacodon and the Höövör petrosals show morphologies suggestive of greater acoustic performance (in terms of selectivity and sensitivity) unique to this lineage within Mammalia.Osteologically, these specimens demonstrate that several of the internal labyrinthine features appearing in the earliest mammaliaforms (e.g. lateral curvature of the cochlear endocast and lagenar inflation) were lost before most of the advanced cladotherian morphological features related to cochlear coiling and the bony support of the cochlear nerve appeared (Fig 10). Interestingly, this evolutionary loss of lateral curvature of the cochlear canal before the advent of its dorsoventral coiling is not matched by the developmental trajectory of the membranous cochlear duct; as seen in rodent models [128,182,183], lateral curvature and subsequent dorsoventral coiling form two discrete stages in the development of the membranous labyrinth [184]. Additionally, the ontogenetic initiation of hearing in humans and a variety of model organisms seems to parallel the hypothesized evolutionary transformation of the cochlea, with the hair cells responding to low-frequencies changing from basal to apical regions during normal development [185]. Dorsoventral coiling may then ultimately be evolutionarily associated with a rudimentary adaptation of the mammalian cochlea for the preservation of frequency sensitivity in the ancestral (low-frequency) range [143].For reasons outlined above, it also seems likely that the perceptual capacity for sound source localization was undeveloped or rudimentary in early mammaliaforms. The hypothetical pressure gradient receiver form of auditory localization was either reduced or absent before the capacity to use advanced ILD and ITD forms of localization developed in the immediate ancestors of crown therians. The localization mechanism most likely to be present in the forms described here would have been based on monaural pinna-based signals, for which the preservation of an external pinna in one exceptionally preserved theriimorph specimen can be considered evidence [107]. However, even using these pinna-based cues, this form of localization in the stem therians described here would mostly be competent for front-back localization of sound sources.This is not to suggest that early stem therians displayed poor hearing capacities generally, and the presence of a salient secondary bony lamina within the cochlear endocasts described here (“sl” in Fig 10a, 10c and 10e) suggests some amount of adhesion between the cochlear duct and spiral ligament with the abneural cochlear canal (Fig 15c and 15d). This is an advanced level of structural organization beyond the state seen in even modern monotremes, and is likely associated with a greater commitment to macromechanical tuning than that seen in extant monotremes. The attachment of the basilar membrane to the newly evolved secondary lamina before the advent of the primary bony lamina also suggests that the basilar membrane in these forms was less tense and stabilized than is typical of modern therians. However, it is also likely that the low-frequency limitations of the stem therians described here would not have precluded these forms from relying on an insect-based diet, which has been predicted as the mainstay of most generalized Mesozoic lineages including those represented by the fossils described here [186–190]. One study [191] estimates that at least one Middle Jurassic katydid species produced frequencies (~6.4 kHz) which would very plausibly be detectable by these stem therians.This report details the bony features pertinent for the phylogenetic and soft tissue reconstruction of Priacodon, Höövör petrosal 1 and especially the newly described Höövör petrosal 2 (Figs 1–10). However, perhaps the most significant aspect of cochlear morphology presented by these specimens is what they entail regarding the rate of high-frequency adaptation near the therian crown group. If the uniquely derived and phylogenetically unstable clades Gondwanatheria and Multituberculata are excluded, the theriimorph specimens used here provide a phylogenetic bracket around the advanced clade Cladotheria. To date the majority of previously described Mesozoic mammalian petrosal specimens belong to Cladotheria, and several convergent derivations of the fully coiled cochlear canal, tractus foraminosus (convergent with monotremes; Fig 15b and 15e), and primary bony lamina are likely within this group. The petrosals described here corroborate the slow rate of upper frequency limit increase in the synapsid lineage up to the advent of Cladotheria; and that cladotheres may therefore be thought of as an evolutionary radiation into a high-frequency world [192]. Within the Cretaceous, both crown therians and South American dryolestoids both achieve a structurally “modern” fully-coiled form of the cochlear canal [6,85]. This may have been a response to selection for sound-source localization, particularly the capacity to locate brief environmental cues faster than visual inspection alone [3,33]. However, our hypothesis that this capacity was lacking, or poorly developed, in the immediate stem therian ancestors of the cladotheres suggests that the central or peripheral processing of sound in these early forms was either incapable of modern therian performance parameters, or an appropriate selective pressure for high frequency hearing was absent in earlier Mesozoic environments. The lack of clear selective advantage may in turn be attributable to evolutionary compromises between high-frequency requirements for sound localization and possible behavioral requirements for low-frequency perception (such as non-tympanic sound conduction); or the uncompetitive nature of the small insectivore niche in the Mesozoic. Whatever the original impetus for the development of ultrasonic frequency sensitivity, the segregation of terrestrial vertebrate faunas into a high-frequency therian component and low-frequency sauropsid component has persisted from the Jurassic to the present day.']"
2015-05-28T00:00:00Z,Summary of the DREAM8 Parameter Estimation Challenge: Toward Parameter Identification for Whole-Cell Models,"['Overall, the challenge confirmed that whole-cell model parameter estimation is a formidable problem. Significant work remains to develop efficient parameter estimation methods suitable for high-dimensional, nonlinear whole-cell models. Nevertheless, the challenge successfully expanded the whole-cell modeling community and initiated an important dialogue about how to best estimate whole-cell model parameters.Going forward, several parameter estimation innovations are needed to enable researchers to achieve fully accurate models of complex organisms. First, researchers need to develop automated methods for constructing reduced models which are tractable to numerical optimization. Researchers should pursue both statistical and physics-based reduced models. Ideally, these models will take advantage of the unique temporal and population average structure of most experimental cell biology data.Second, researchers must develop simulation engines that quickly execute whole-cell models. This will enable researchers to more accurately identify parameters by enabling them to quickly explore parameter combinations. This can be accomplished by developing a simulation engine that executes multiple submodels simultaneously and that parallelizes the execution of each individual submodel.Third, researchers must develop distributed optimization algorithms that quickly explore the parameter space. Individual workers should communicate so that workers each learn from each other. These parallel optimization methods will enable researchers to find ensembles of highly optimal solutions.Fourth, researchers must develop visualizations that highlight differences among model simulations. This will help researchers design experiments to select among otherwise equivalently scoring parameters sets. In turn, this will help researchers discover and characterize new biological mechanisms.Lastly, researchers need to develop new high-throughput experimental technologies that characterize single-cell variation and temporal dynamics. High-throughput measurements have enabled whole-cell modeling by greatly increasing their practical identifiability. However, currently researchers still have to estimate variance parameters from systems data. New technologies could enable researchers to more easily estimate variance parameters, as well as test variance predictions.We are optimistic that collaborative efforts such as DREAM will produce these new tools. These tools will enable researchers to build more accurate models of more complex organisms, starting with more complex bacteria such as E. coli followed by single-celled eukaryotes such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, multicellular eukaryotes such as Caenorhabditis elegans, and lastly humans. In turn, these new models will open new avenues for rationally designing microorganisms with unprecedented capabilities and ultimately enable physicians to design personalized medical therapies.\nDREAM8 Parameter Estimation Challenge Consortium\n\nTeam 9\nYucheng Hu1\n1 Zhou Peiyuan Center of Applied Mathematics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China\n\n\nTeam Alucinatori\nMichael Baron1, Kevin Bryson1\n1 University College London, London, United Kingdom\n\n\nTeam Crux\nAndreas Raue1,2, Bernhard Steiert1,2, Jens Timmer1–4, Clemens Kreutz1,2\n1 Institute for Physics, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany\n2 Freiburg Center for Systems Biology (ZBSA), University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany\n3 Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies (FRIAS), University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany\n4 BIOSS Centre for Biological Signalling Studies, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany\n\n\nTeam CU\nBrandon Barker1,3, Elijah Bogart2, Yiping Wang1,3, Dhruva Chandramohan1, Lei Huang1, Kelson Zawack1,3, Alexander A.

2013-10-24T00:00:00Z,Coastal Fisheries in the Eastern Baltic Sea (Gulf of Finland) and Its Basin from the 15 to the Early 20th Centuries,"['In this study, we report new data extracted from archival sources and historical literature related to fisheries in the Eastern Gulf of Finland from the 15 to early 20th centuries. We put them in biological context to facilitate usage by fish biologists and policy makers.Fishing gear notably developed during the study period. In the early cadastres weirs and drift nets were most frequently mentioned. This gear combination is well known in other regions of Russia. In addition to being very effective individually, weirs facilitate the use of gill nets because fish are concentrated in front of the weir. Although a primitive technology, weir construction and maintenance take much effort. Historically they were constructed of branches, often of fir. In the mid-19th century weirs started to be replaced by larger traps. Beach seines were also common in river and inshore fisheries. Later on, fixed nets appeared and were deployed under the ice in the winter herring fisheries. Specialized gear was used for capturing eel (stozh) and lamprey (morda).In this study we analyzed the dynamics of fish populations using catch data. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) would have provided a better proxy for population abundance because it accounts for fishing effort, but data on fishing effort are rare in old records. In addition, this study mostly operates with catches of anadromous fish in rivers. Riverine gear, which usually do not change much in construction and are used in the same locations over centuries, exhibit much more stable fishing effort than gear deployed at sea.Although fragmentary, the data allow us to trace long-term trends in fisheries patterns and fish populations. Such trends are sometimes difficult to comprehend in short-term data series. One clear pattern is the gradual movement of major fishing locations from upstream to downstream river sections. We suspect that the decrease in the number of fishing weirs from 55 to 39 near Ivangorod on the Narva River from 1565 to 1572 was the first indication of this trend. By the 19th century the main fishing areas on both the Luga and the Narva Rivers (excluding fisheries for catadromous eels) were located near their mouths. The trend was also visible in Neva River fisheries, as catches in Neva Bay increased much more between the 1870s and 1930s than catches in River itself. However, this move took place later than in the Luga and Narva Rivers likely because the Neva is larger.The shift from river to marine fisheries is typical of fisheries development in general, and occurred in many parts of Western Europe almost a millennium ago. Mostly, it resulted from the overfishing of freshwater and diadromous species, but it was also facilitated by river pollution due to industrial development and population growth [62], [63]. Barret and coauthors [64] showed that marine fishes like cod started to dominate in the diet of West Europeans after the 10–11th centuries. Historically, diadromous sturgeons, followed by salmon, were the first species that declined [62], [65]. This phenomenon was reported for the most densely populated parts of Europe, including the Southern Baltic area.In the eastern Baltic Sea this shift took place much later, in the 19th century. Today no commercial fisheries are located in rivers except a traditional lamprey fishery that inhabitants of St.Petersburg conduct in autumn from bridges crossing the Neva River. Sources clearly show that other trends, such as a progressive development of fishing gear and a growing intensity of fishing effort, resulted in considerably increased pressure on fish populations. The effect of fishing pressure was compounded by habitat degradation: pollution, dam construction etc.Changes in fishing patterns are closely and mutually interrelated with changes in fish abundance: changing fishing patterns can cause, and are affected by, changes in fish abundance. In the eastern Gulf of Finland, the movement of fisheries downstream was caused in part by competition among fishermen for better fishing locations. Given that the main target species were anadromous, downstream fishing sites had obvious advantages, especially with declining populations. At the same time, increased fishing pressure at the mouths of rivers resulted in faster declines of anadromous fish populations.Historically, the first overfished species in the Gulf was sturgeon, now more endangered than any other group of species worldwide (http://www.iucn.org/?4928). Precious roe and meat combined with slow growth and maturation, a comparatively simple fishing technique, and vulnerability to habitat degradation and pollution resulted in the extinction of sturgeon in the Baltic Sea. Historical evidence for sturgeon fisheries is scarce because the majority of river sturgeon populations declined long ago. However, archeological evidence indicates that sturgeon were among the earliest target species in the area. For instance, in the 8th century sturgeon were already important food fish in the town of Staraya Ladoga on the Volkhov River near their spawning grounds [66]. Most likely, the Neva river sturgeon population became extinct later than populations in other Baltic rivers. It maintained commercial significance until the 1960s. The last known sturgeon in the Baltic Sea was caught in 1996 near Saaremaa Island [67].Other migrating fish such as Atlantic salmon, whitefish, smelt and, to a lesser extent, vimba bream were the basis for regional fisheries for most of the study period. Except for smelt, these species had experienced a notable decline by the early 20th century and have now completely lost commercial significance. Smelt maintained significance longer due to higher abundance until very recent times, but now Neva River smelt have experienced a drastic decline caused not only by overfishing but also degradation of their spawning grounds [47]. Current efforts promoting smelt as part of St. Petersburg’s cultural and gastronomical heritage have sound historical basis, but conservation measures may be inadequate to maintain sufficient resources. Eel and lamprey appear in Russian sources quite late, only in the 18th century, probably because they required specialized fishing gear, or due to market changes. Eels were important in the mid-19th century in the Narva River, but then declined. Lamprey, although less important historically than salmon, whitefish or smelt, have remained commercially viable at present, probably due to limited demand. Fluctuations of the anadromous lamprey and vendace show no declining trend. Unlike other migrating fish, their abundance may be driven by natural factors.Freshwater species such as roach, ide, pike, perch, ruffe, burbot regularly occur in historical sources. Although in some areas they exceeded half of the total catch, data on these fish is poor because their commercial value was generally low. They were not as important as migrating fish and do not show any definite trends in abundance.']"
2014-09-08T00:00:00Z,Matrix Expansion and Syncytial Aggregation of Syndecan-1+ Cells Underpin Villous Atrophy in Coeliac Disease,"['Matrix changes in coeliac disease are distinct from in IBD, which shows widespread loss of mucosal sulphated GAGs [22]. In coeliac disease, GAG disruption is limited to the epithelial compartment, while the lamina propria shows undiminished sulphated GAG expression. By contrast, unsulphated hyaluronan has been shown to be patchily decreased in coeliac mucosa [23]. Limitations imposed by biopsy size currently preclude more formal glycobiochemical assessment. While we measured tissue area as a proxy for volume, this cannot be directly determined from biopsy sections, though previous mathematical modelling suggests an approximate doubling of volume in coeliac disease [2].Loss of epithelial HSPG promotes protein leak into the lumen [7],[8]. Our findings of lost epithelial HSPG will contribute to the increased albumin leak in coeliac disease [24]. The rarity of coeliac crisis, characterised by severe PLE, is likely due to retardation of albumin within the coeliac lamina propria in an expanded anionic gel [24], comprising aggregates of negatively charged syndecan-expressing leukocytes in a matrix of sulphated GAGs. Acute infection, the usual trigger of coeliac crisis, will induce vascular albumin leak and upregulation of mucosal matrix degrading metalloproteases, thus delivering unrestricted albumin to the HSPG-depleted basement membrane and epithelium to promote PLE.We found that much of the mucosal GAGs in coeliac disease localises within syncytial aggregates of syndecan-1+ plasma cells, cell remnants with intracytoplasmic staining and shed syndecan ectodomains. Classic studies of gluten-induced changes in coeliac disease showed that villous atrophy is caused by swelling of the intervillous ridges [3] and that gluten-induced matrix deposition in the lamina propria was characterised by dense aggregation of plasma cells - many lysed with loss of their limiting membrane [4]. These features are entirely consistent with our findings.We hypothesise that our findings, of syndecan-1+ cell syncytial aggregation with excess GAG production, recapitulate core elements of the invertebrate encapsulation reaction, in which insect haemocytes form palisades around an invading pathogen or object too large to phagocytose [13]–[15],[25],[26]. Many initially binding cells undergo lysis, while subsequent adhering cells form extensive sheets to wall off the pathogen. GAG production is stimulated [13]–[15],[26], providing a physiological barrier to nutrient absorption. Recruited cells are characterised by syndecan expression [27], required for invertebrate haemocyte binding to laminin and cell cluster formation [28]. Our findings in coeliac mucosa show a similar palisading of syndecan-expressing leukocytes to form syncytial aggregates, together with a lysis of a proportion of these cells, with loss of their plasma membrane. Sulphated GAG including HSPG accumulated around these aggregates in an expansion of the lamina propria. In insects, the GAG production and matrix expansion is limited by a subsequent melanisation reaction dependent on the enzyme prophenoloxidase [29], in which haemocyte responses are downregulated by α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) [30]. In coeliac mucosa the gliadin-induced IL-6 response is similarly attenuated by α-MSH [31].A contrasting interpretation of our findings is that the plasma cell aggregates may represent a peripheral niche for plasma cell survival [32]. Membrane syndecan-1 is critical for long-term survival of plasma cells, binding to mediators such as APRIL and CXCL12 that prevent apoptosis [33]. IL-6 also plays an important role in maintaining plasma cell survival in the periphery [32]. While such a niche cannot be excluded, it is notable that many of the plasma cells show evidence of lysis [3], a characteristic of invertebrate encapsulation [13]–[15].The encapsulation reaction has additional specific similarities to coeliac disease, as encapsulation is dependent on both insect transglutaminase expression [34] and two gliadin-like early encapsulation proteins [35]. Could exogenous gliadin thus trigger this response? It is notable in this context that the glutenin moiety of wheats provides an effective barrier to predation by most insect species, and there are notably few successful phytophagous predators. Insects able to predate wheat share a common ability to predigest gluten with salivary enzymes, which has evolved separately in species from the northern and southern hemispheres. The Sunn bug Eurygaster integricepts, a major pest in southern Europe, north Africa and Asia, secretes glutenin-specific serine proteases in its saliva, cleaving gliadin at glutamine residues between consensus hexapeptide and nonapeptide repeats [36],[37]. The New Zealand wheat bug, Nysius huttoni, secretes a more specific salivary proteinase species, cleaving between glutamine and glycine residues within hexapetide repeats [38]. Insect-predated wheat shows abnormalities in the ability to make dough, because of this molecular disruption [36]–[38]. The role of glutenins in dough production was critical in Neolithic times, leading to early selection for high glutenin wheats [39]. It would be ironic if the dietary constituent that played such a role in advancing human socio-economic development had evolved in plant host defense as a trigger of innate immunity in predators.Our finding of shed syndecan ectodomains may provide a link between innate immune response to gliadins and the MHC-restricted adaptive immune response characteristic of coeliac disease. One unexplained mechanism in coeliac disease is the triggering of extracellular release of TG2 and its subsequent activation, necessary for deamidation of gluten and adaptive immune responses [40]. Syndecan shedding is critical in the release of TG2 from cells into the extracellular milieu, through specific binding of TG2 to syndecan HS chains [41]. In enterocytes the uptake of α(2)-gliadin-mer is facilitated by the small GTP-ase Rab5 [42], which interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-1 to regulate ectodomain shedding [43]. Following TG2 release, the presence of calcium and inhibition of local oxidation are critical for its activation [40]. Known functions of HS include local sequestration of cations and binding of superoxide dismutase [6], thus potentially allowing shed syndecan ectodomains to provide a milieu favourable to TG2 activation.Excess mucosal IL-6 production has been shown to occur in coeliac disease and to differentiate it from non-coeliac gluten intolerance, in which enhanced innate immune responses also occur but without adaptive changes [16]. We did not formally characterise the IL-6 producing cells, but noted lymphocyte-like and macrophage-like populations, without evidence of epithelial immunoreactivity. IL-6 has multiple functions in immune regulation and inflammation, and is particularly important in autoimmune diseases. It regulates the balance between generation of IL-17 producing cells and T regulatory cells towards an inflammatory response, by promoting development of Th17 cells in concert with TGF-β while blocking TGF-β induced production of Treg cells [44]. Other Th17 pathway components are increased within coeliac mucosa [45],[46], with exposure to IL-15 promoting a Th17 response to gliadin by monocytes [47]. Whether other Th17 cytokines may contribute to pathological matrix expansion, as does IL-6 [17]–[20], is currently unclear.Gliadin peptides have been shown induce a significant innate immune response in epithelium, mucosal macrophages and dendritic cells in humans, both with and without coeliac disease, as well as in murine cells [45],[48]–[55]. We propose that elements of this innate response contribute to the characteristic architectural disturbance in coeliac disease in a fashion analogous to the insect encapsulation reaction, through cell recruitment and induced matrix expansion. In refractory coeliac disease, where villous atrophy persists despite gluten free diet, mucosal IL-6 expression is further increased [56] and its systemic release enhanced, especially in enteropathy associated T cell lymphoma [57]. IL-6 may represent a pivotal target for immunotherapy in refractory coeliac disease.']"
2019-10-23T00:00:00Z,The dynamics of Early Celtic consumption practices: A case study of the pottery from the Heuneburg,"['By integrating archaeological and organic residue analyses we are able to shed new light on Early Celtic consumption practices and provide important initial insights into their complex transformation over time, which was certainly influenced in part by the dynamics of intercultural encounter with the Mediterranean. Our results gain even more importance within the framework of the discussions concerning Early Celtic commensality mentioned above. First and most importantly, the amount of imported pottery must not be taken as an indicator of the amount of imported Mediterranean wine. Secondly, the importation of significant amounts of wine started before the first clear evidence for the importation of Mediterranean feasting vessels (contra [95, 102]). The significant number of vessels containing wine residues during (and one even before) the existence of the mud-brick wall (Ha D1) shows that: i) we need to rethink the intensity of exchange in perishable products like wine from the Mediterranean to Central Europe during Ha D1 (cf. already [86]), ii) the consumption of wine was not limited to a certain space of the settlement during Ha D1 and it is therefore difficult to discern whether its consumption was reserved for the elite (as previously assumed) or accessible to all members of this community, and iii) wine consumption was initially not aimed at imitating Mediterranean feasting practices. Indeed, it was consumed from a large variety of vessels, which were also used for the consumption of other fermented beverages and/or food. It seems that the community which created and expressed itself and its power with the construction of the mud-brick wall [108, 109] was also formed and united by drinking imported wine–in both cases representing a “statement referencing a distant cultural source of power” [109]. Maybe labor was even mobilized by “work-party feasts” [94] that included wine consumption. The appearance of almost all of the imported Attic pottery in the late 6th century BC (Ha D2/D3), after the end of the mudbrick phase, coincided with a clear change in function and meaning of wine consumption. Our results indicate that during Ha D3 wine was no longer consumed from local handmade pottery. Only imported Attic pottery and the newly produced local wheel-made pottery were now used for wine consumption. At the same time, other fruit by-product(s) were consumed from a large number of locally produced drinking vessels. Perhaps wine consumption became more conspicuous and possibly more restricted to imported and local wheel-made feasting dishes, as well as to a narrower part of the society (similar to a “diacritical feast” cf. [94]). This transformation could have been inspired by an increasing knowledge of Mediterranean drinking practices, hence the preferred use of imported kraters, jugs and drinking bowls, most of which have given evidence of wine. Certain actors within Early Celtic society seem to have managed to transform the meaning of wine by successfully limiting its consumption to certain vessels and spaces. These novel commensal practices seem to have served as a means of creating/enforcing their identities and to further establish/secure their position within society. It is most interesting to note that the findings from the Ha D2/D3-phases of the Heuneburg mirror the previous results for the contemporaneous Ha D2/D3 settlement of Vix-Mont Lassois [71]. This new relation between conspicuous wine consumption and social elites established in Ha D2/D3 extended into later Celtic society, when the Greek author Poseidonius reports that Celtic elites drank wine whereas the lower parts of Celtic society consumed beer (cf. [110]).Another product associated with bacterio-fermentation (BHF), probably a bee- or a plant by-product, was found especially in the vessels from the plateau and the outer settlements. Our study demonstrates the consumption of such a beverage(s) during Ha D1, mostly in association with the Mediterranean style goblets that are often seen as an indication of the imitation of Mediterranean drinking practices [21]. However, their use for other fermented beverage drinking represents clear evidence for their creative appropriation [111]. The rare presence of BHF in coarse and cone-necked vessels could have been related to its preparation or storage, especially in the outer settlement. After the abandonment of the outer settlement (Ha D2/D3 and Ha D3), our results show that BHF beverage(s) are only found in vessels from the plateau, and always in association with imported pottery which had recently appeared. However, BHF beverage(s) are still identified in a large portion of the locally produced vessels studied, including handmade pottery.Beehive products may also have played a role (as sweetener, sealant or possibly even as mead) in drinking practices, at least during the Ha D1 period, as suggested by the presence of beeswax with fermented beverages in goblets and beakers. These results confirm the importance of bee-products in the West Hallstatt area, which has already been noted for the settlement contexts at the site of Vix-Mont Lassois [71] and which was also indicated by the presence of honey/mead in the bronze vessels from Early Iron Age elite burials [81, 83, 84]. However, direct and unequivocal evidence for the presence of mead is as yet difficult to obtain using organic residue analysis. Hence, while there is a strong possibility that mead was present, in particular in light of the high quantities of bee products found in the vessels, we lack the data to assert it conclusively [71].Animal fats and millet markers are rarely found in combination with fermentation markers (never during Ha D3) and are most probably linked to food practices. With regard to Ha D1 vessels, millet, animal fats (in particular dairy products), and beeswax are often identified together in the bowls and large vessels from a specific area of the plateau and the lower town settlements. Our results point to the importance of such products, possibly consumed together as some kind of millet porridge. A similar pattern is still observed in the Ha D3 vessels from the lower town settlement. However, the present study also shows that the consumption of beehive products seems to decrease, and millet is no longer identified in the vessels from the plateau. Other plant by-products may have also played a significant role in the diet as suggested by the presence of plant wax and plant oil, especially in the lower town settlement. The presence of dairy fats in a large number of differently shaped vessels points to the importance of these products in eating and drinking practices at the Heuneburg during the final Hallstatt periods. The importance of dairy products in the settlement contexts seems to be in accordance with some results of a recent proteomic study (a promising and fast developing new direction in obtaining dietary information from ceramics, see [112]) of six vessels from the burial context of Heuneburg-Speckhau Tumulus 17 [113, 114].Specialized use could be attested for some vessels, such as Attic ceramics and local goblets/ beakers, which were used specifically for the consumption of fermented products (wine and/or BHF). Additional use(s), such as the consumption of other food products, were observed in local bowls and large vessels during Ha D1. The presence of food and fermentation products, sometimes in the same vessel, could indicate multi-functionality of vessels. Based on the vessels tested, an increase in the specialized use of drinking and serving vessels can be observed during Ha D3, when fermented beverages and animal fats were never identified together.Finally, our study reveals some patterns related to the spaces of consumption. We show evidence for (i) the important and unexpected consumption and preparation/storage of fermented products (including wine) in the outer settlement, (ii) activities related to food consumption and/or preparation (dairy, millet and beehive by-products), which could be specific to the intra-plateau area during Ha D1, and (iii) a possible distinction of practices between the plateau (consumption of fermented drinks) and the lower town settlement (food consumption) during Ha D3.']"
2012-10-15T00:00:00Z,Compromised Mitochondrial Fatty Acid Synthesis in Transgenic Mice Results in Defective Protein Lipoylation and Energy Disequilibrium,"['The most striking characteristic of the Mcat-knockout phenotype is the energy disequilibrium. Affected mice consume more food than control animals, yet they fail to gain weight and are less physically active, they have reduced muscle strength and stamina, they eventually lose all of their white adipose tissue, develop alopecia and kyphosis, loose weight and have a shortened lifespan. Despite their retention of normal brown adipose tissue depots and their shivering behavior, the KO mice are unable to maintain normal body temperature. Biochemical analyses strongly suggest that the primary factor responsible for development of this phenotype is a diminished capacity of tissues such as skeletal muscle to process the products of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation through the citric acid cycle. Thus the KO animals have elevated levels of skeletal muscle lactate, blood lactate and ketone bodies. The mitochondrial pathway for fatty acid synthesis appears dedicated to the production of octanoyl moieties, the lipoyl precursor, and has limited ability to form longer-chain acyl moieties [3], [9]. Consistent with this concept, failure of the pathway, though knockout of the Mcat gene, manifests primarily as a lipoylation defect, rather than as altered mitochondrial fatty acid composition. The amounts of the catalytically-active lipoylated forms of all four components of the mitochondrial lipoamide subproteome, the E2 subunits of the PDC, KDC and BCDC dehydrogenases, and the H-protein component of the glycine cleavage system (GCSH) are reduced in tissues of KO mice, most notably in skeletal muscle and kidney. These results indicate that the de novo pathway for generation of lipoyl moieties is vital for normal energy metabolism.Prior to the discovery of this pathway it was generally assumed that in mammals lipoyl moieties employed in the posttranslational modification of mitochondrial proteins were derived from free lipoate, which is first activated to lipoyl-AMP and then transferred to the lysine acceptor residue at the lipoylation site. The two enzymes required for this process, a lipoate activating enzyme and lipoyl transferase (Lipt1) have been characterized from bovine liver mitochondria [11], [12]. In contrast, the de novo pathway operates through different intermediates: an octanoyl moiety is translocated from thioester linkage on the ACP to the lysine residue on the acceptor protein, where the two sulfur atoms are subsequently introduced by lipoic acid synthase (Lias). Although this enzyme has yet to be characterized in mammals, a constitutive knockout of the Lias gene in mice was found to be lethal in early embryonic development [41]. Furthemore, downregulation of the pathway for mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis in human cell culture compromised the protein lipoylation pathway and resulted in cell death [10]. Lipoate supplementation of the diet fed to the pregnant mother did not rescue the knockout mouse embryos neither did lipoate supplementation of the culture medium improve survival of cultured HEK293 cells [10], [41]. These findings, together with the observation that the Mcat-deficient mice exhibit a lipoylation defect, raise the question as to why, with two independent pathways available for protein lipoylation, down-regulation of the de novo pathway is not compensated for by the utilization of free lipoate. The answer appears to be that, whereas the enzymes required for the de novo pathway are expressed broadly in many different tissues, the lipoyl transferase required for the free lipoate pathway is expressed predominantly in the liver and is not inducible in either liver or extrahepatic tissues when Mcat is compromised. Although we did not attempt rescue of the Mcat-deficient phenotype by lipoate supplementation, in view of the earlier failure of this approach in other model systems it seems likely that restricted expression of the Lipt1 limits the ability of the lipoate scavenging pathway to service universally the components of the mitochondrial lipoamide subproteome.As is the case with many inducible gene knockout animal models, the tamoxifen-induced ablation of the Mcat gene is incomplete so that the residual enzyme expression ranges from 0.2% in skeletal muscle to 53% in spleen. Additionally, as discussed above, in some tissues the Mcat defect results in only mildly compromised protein lipoylation so that the phenotypic changes observed in the Mcat knockout model are milder than would be anticipated for a general, constitutive knockout. Retention of some protein lipoylation capacity in tissues such as liver also allows for further metabolism of lactate and ketone bodies released from tissues that are compromised by a severe lipoylation defect. Consequently, the effects of the Mcat knockout are less grave than total knockouts of components of the mitochondrial lipoamide subproteome, which can lead to severe neurological and cardiac defects [42], [43], [44], [45]. Mutations in components of the mitochondrial pathway for fatty acid synthesis that produce a lethal null phenotype, as observed in the knockout of mouse Lias, the terminal enzyme in the de novo pathway for protein lipoylation, are unlikely to manifest as disease in the human population. Therefore, one can argue that the hypomorphic phenotype observed with the inducible Mcat knockout represents a more useful model for predicting the consequences of a non-lethal defect in the pathway in the human population. In the Mcat KO model, the degree of Mcat knockdown and compromised protein lipoylation is particularly severe in skeletal muscle. Indeed, muscle weakness and poor posture is a readily recognizable characteristic of the phenotype and may play a role in the development of both kyphosis, through weakening of the paraspinal muscle [46], and rectal prolapse, through weakening of muscles of the anal sphincter and those that hold the rectum in place [47].Because of the crucial role played by the citric acid cycle in energy metabolism, the primary defect in lipoylation of PDC and KDC resulting from the deficiency in Mcat in some tissues may initiate a cascade of secondary effects that could contribute to the phenotype. In skeletal muscle, where the lipoylation pathway is severely effected, a compromised citric acid cycle could limit the availability of citrate for export into the cytosol where it provides the acetyl-CoA required for de novo fatty acid synthesis via the type I fatty acid synthase. Triglycerides synthesized and stored in muscle cells are now recognized as an important fuel for muscle activity during exercise [48]. Other less predictable secondary effects, such as the observed late-developing depletion of components of the electron transport chain in muscle, may also contribute to the phenotype. Detailed evaluation of these secondary effects resulting from the lipoylation defect in different tissues was beyond the scope of this initial study. A summary highlighting the features of the Mcat-deficient phenotype is presented in Box 1.Many of the phenotypic characteristics of the Mcat knockout mouse model bear striking resemblance to those described in other models of compromised mitochondrial function that have been collectively termed as examples of accelerated aging. For example, mice carrying a proofreading-deficient mitochondrial DNA polymerase exhibit reduced lifespan, weight loss, reduced subcutaneous white adipose, alopecia, kyphosis and an age-dependent, macrocytic anemia with abnormal erythroid maturation [33], [49]. These phenotypic changes result primarily from an accumulation of mutations in the mitochondrial genome that leads to loss of respiratory chain function. Mice deficient in the mitochondrial helicase SupvL1, a component of the mitochondrial RNA degradosome complex, exhibit growth retardation, kyphosis, thickening of the epidermis and atrophy of subcutaneous adipose and muscle mass and early death [50]. In this case the phenotypic changes most likely result from aberrant mitochondrial RNA processing that leads to impaired protein synthesis and ATP production. Recently, a mouse model with compromised mitochondrial superoxide dismutase exclusively in connective tissue has been described that is also characterized by weight loss, osteoporosis and kyphosis, skin abnormalities, muscle loss and reduced lifespan [51]. In this model, the altered phenotype results from oxidative damage in mitochondria and loss of redox balance.Although it may seem remarkable that random mutations in mitochondrial DNA, defects in the mitochondrial degradosome, deficiency of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase and compromised mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis precipitate a similar set of phenotypic changes, this is one of the hallmarks of mitochondrial diseases: different mutations in either the mitochondrial or nuclear genomes can lead to similar diseases, known as phenocopies. Several phenotypic features of these mouse models of accelerated aging are also associated with aging in humans, particularly osteoporosis, kyphosis, decreased muscle strength, loss of subcutaneous fat resulting in skin wrinkling and alopecia, prolapsed rectum and weight loss, typically after age 60 years. The broad range of mitochondrial defects that can lead to the accelerated aging phenotype serves to illustrate the difficulty in establishing the etiology of human diseases in which defective mitochondrial function is implicated. The present study suggests that current guidelines for the evaluation of patients of all ages with suspected mitochondrial diseases [2] should be broadened to include the possibility of compromised mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis and protein lipoylation.']"
2017-12-06T00:00:00Z,"Chow fed UC Davis strain female Lepr fatty Zucker rats exhibit mild glucose intolerance, hypertriglyceridemia, and increased urine volume, all reduced by a Brown Norway strain chromosome 1 congenic donor region","['Our results show that female fatty UC Davis ZUC strain animals have a mild prediabetes phenotype with fasting blood glucose above 100 mg/dL, when using American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria for prediabetes in humans of >100 mg/dL for fasting plasma glucose [54]. The results for fatty animals assessed at 27 weeks of age also meet ADA criteria for prediabetes in humans of >140 mg/dL 2 hours after an oral glucose tolerance test [54]. Because the fasting blood glucose measurements were made using an uncalibrated OneTouch Ultra Meter, then it is possible that actual glucose levels are less than 100 mg/dL. We conclude that UC Davis ZUC strain animals either have prediabetic blood glucose levels or they almost do when using ADA criteria for humans. The congenic captures BN strain alleles that reduce blood glucose area under the curve (AUC) levels compared with congenic donor genotype ZUC animals during a glucose tolerance test (Table 4) and that also reduce urine glucose lost per day (Fig 4). Since there were no effects of the BN congenic donor region on fasted glucose or insulin tolerance tests, then the results suggest that the BN chromosome 1 donor region reduces the mild glucose intolerance observed during GTT tests of the UC Davis female ZUC strain animals, but there appears to be no congenic donor region genotype effect on insulin resistance. However, there is a clear effect of Lepr genotype on insulin resistance in females, with fatty animals being insulin resistant (Fig 6). We have not measured any traits in ZUC from other vendors or institutions, so we do not know how our results could compare to other ZUC strains. Thus, the BN.ZUC-D1Rat183-D1Rt90 congenic strain is a model for glucose intolerant type 2 diabetes with similar effects in both males and females, although the type 2 diabetes is more severe in males and is very mild in females. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that both genders can be used to map the underlying genes that influence phenotypes of type 2 diabetes and kidney disease. Finally, whether or not the fatty Lepr deficient animals are labeled as prediabetic, the BN donor region of the congenic improves glucose tolerance, i.e., its presence results in reduced blood glucose levels during a glucose tolerance test.The food intake data shows that BN genotype congenic strain females eat significantly less than ZUC strain animals, particularly at older ages. Previous data from our lab has shown that food intake restriction of ZUC strain animals is correlated with reduced urinary albumin excretion and reduced plasma triglyceride levels [17, 18]. Thus, our hypothesis is that the reduced food intake of the BN genotype strain congenic (Fig 1) may contribute to their reduced plasma triglyceride levels (Table 3) [18]. In a previous publication we demonstrated that male fatty ZUC genotype animals had much higher urine volumes, particularly after 15 weeks of age [14]. We have observed significant effects of ZUC congenic donor genotype to increase urine volume of female LeprfaSte/faSte animals (Fig 2). Thus, males and females show similar effects of the congenic donor region genotype on urine volume. There were no significant chromosome 1 congenic region genotype effects for ACR in UC Davis females (Fig 3). In males the chromosome 1 congenic region genotype had a significant effect on ACR, so males and females have different phenotypes for this trait in our colony [14].Other investigators have examined kidney function in male and female ZUC. In a study of lean and fatty Zucker males and fatty female Zucker rats observed at 16 weeks, obese females have more than 15-fold higher ACR than lean males and about half the ACR of fatty males [55]. At 15 weeks we observed that ACR (mg UAE per mg creatinine) was 2.6 mg/mg in fatty females and 6.4 mg/mg in fatty males. In comparison, Dominguez et al [55] reported 1.2 mg urine albumin/mg creatinine for males and 0.67 mg/mg for females. Thus, females reproducibly develop a milder kidney disease than males.We did not assess kidney pathology in females in the present study. A cohort study of 177,570 individuals conducted over an almost 10 year span searched for risk factors for end stage renal disease (ESRD) [5]. This study reported that the two most potent risk factors were proteinuria (hazard ratio of 7.9 for 3 to 4+ on urine dipstick) and excess weight (hazard ratio 4.39 for class II or III obesity). We have previously shown that in the UC Davis Zucker fatty male model ACR is increased 42-fold from 9 to 28 weeks of age with the ZUC background strain genotype on chromosome 1 [14, 15]. For females ACR in fatty animals with the chromosome 1 ZUC genotype also increased 16-fold over the same timespan, consistent with mild kidney disease.Although female ZUC are often considered to be non-diabetic, our GTT results show that several groups (fasted blood glucose and blood glucose 2 hours after start of the GTT, Fig 5) have average blood glucose levels in the prediabetic range [54]. This result may be because we are using a unique colony of ZUC that has been maintained continuously at UC Davis since 1982, or because of some other local peculiarity, such as diet, microbiome or animal care. We have not compared the UC Davis ZUC colony to ZUC strain animals from vendors or other institutions. There were no statistically significant congenic donor genotype or congenic donor genotype x time after injection effects for repeated measures ANOVA of ITT at 13 and 26 weeks of age. Although the present paper does not show results for males because they were previously published [14], GTT and ITT analysis of males revealed essentially the same congenic genotype x time after injection effects on repeated measures ANOVA of the BN donor region on fasting blood glucose after GTT.Do our results identify genes responsible for kidney disease? Significant congenic genotype effects on gene expression (Table 5) means that BN alleles of these genes result in significantly different mRNA levels than ZUC alleles of these genes. We do not know if these expression differences are due to cis or trans effects, because all the animals used have only one of two genotypes–completely ZUC or homozygous for the congenic donor region BN.ZUC-D1Rat183-D1Rat90. Since we did not independently validate dissection using qPCR for genes known to be specific to cortex or medulla, our results generate hypotheses about levels of gene expression in cortex and medulla, but we cannot be definitive about location of expression in the kidney. Despite this limitation, we observe highly significant differences in gene expression by kidney part for all six genes quantitated, consistent with the hypothesis that we have separated parts of the kidney with different levels of expression for these six genes. This also suggests that all six remain positional candidates to influence other phenotypes that map to the BN congenic donor region in females, such as urine volume, urine glucose and glucose response to a GTT.Urine volume is influenced by many factors, including disease, drugs, and behaviors that affect what and how much is drunk. Many papers have identified positive correlations between type 2 diabetes and urine volume [56, 57]. What is not clear is if type 2 diabetes is always causal for increases in urine volume, if increased urine glucose is always causal for increased urine volume, or if the correlation means that type 2 diabetes or elevated urine glucose increases the risk for increased urine volume. Our own data show that 24 week old female fatty ZUC congenic donor genotype animals have higher urine volume than 15 week female fatty ZUC congenic donor genotype animals, but urine glucose lost per day is less at 24 weeks of age than at 15 (Figs 2 and 4). Measurements of urine volume and urine glucose were contemporaneously determined in the same animals so we have directly quantitated the relationships by regression analysis. We observed no significant correlations of urine volume and urine glucose concentration (mg/dL) when including all 4 groups (Lepr and congenic donor genotypes), with each time point (9, 15 and 24 week) analyzed separately. We also observed no significant correlations of urine volume and urine glucose concentration (mg/dL) when analyzing only fatty LeprfaSte/faSte and both congenic donor genotypes–BN and ZUC. We also observed no significant correlations when analyzing only fatty LeprfaSte/faSte animals with the ZUC genotype for the congenic donor region. Thus, our results are not consistent with the hypothesis that urine glucose concentration is the only determinant of urine volume in the UC Davis Zucker rat model. However, as Fig 2 shows there is a strong congenic donor region chromosome 1 genotype effect on urine volume, but the physiological pathway affected is unknown. Four genes in Table 5 (Umod, Sorcs1, Pdilt and Pkd2l1) have highly significant Lepr genotype x congenic donor genotype interaction effects that are consistent with their having a role in controlling urine volume, but our data do not prove causality for any of these. Our results also do not exclude other genes in the congenic donor region that were not tested in Table 5. Thus, the specific gene(s) responsible for the congenic donor genotype effect on urine volume in fatty LeprfaSte/faSte rats is/are unknown.We have shown that the UC Davis ZUC female model has mild prediabetes levels of glucose in fasted blood, 2 hours after start of a glucose tolerance test, and mild glucose intolerance during a glucose tolerance test. The Lepr fatty UC Davis female congenic donor genotype ZUC strain animal has greatly increased plasma triglyceride, increased urine volume compared with Lepr lean controls and loses much more glucose in urine. Several of these traits are reduced in a congenic with a BN donor region on chromosome 1 from microsatellite markers D1Rat183-D1Rat90.']"
