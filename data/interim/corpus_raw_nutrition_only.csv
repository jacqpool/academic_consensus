2014-10-21T00:00:00Z,Psychological Determinants of Consumer Acceptance of Personalised Nutrition in 9 European Countries,"['To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to have modelled factors determining intention to take up personalised nutrition in representative samples of European consumers. An important strength of the study was that the elements of the model have been informed by qualitative research in similar population. These data imply that attitudes towards, and adoption of, personalised nutrition are primarily driven by perceptions of benefit and whether adoption of personalised nutrition is achievable. Trust in regulatory systems (in particular related to data protection) and the extent to which individuals are committed to improving, and perceive that their own actions may influence their own health status and attitudes towards personalised nutrition. This implies that promotion of personalised nutrition to the general public would need to emphasise the (personal) benefits of personalised nutrition. Discussion of risk should focus on end-user concerns, in particular related to data –protection and service delivery. Communication should also address Perceived Efficacy through providing information about how personalised nutrition can be adopted by consumers. Providing information about potential health benefits associated with personalised nutrition may also influence adoption by individuals with low levels of Health Locus of Control.']"
2015-03-13T00:00:00Z,Uncovering the Nutritional Landscape of Food,"['In this study, we have developed a unique computational framework for the systematic analysis of large-scale food and nutritional data. The networks of foods and nutrients offer a global and unbiased view of the organization of nutritional connections, as well as enable the discovery of unexpected knowledge regarding associations between foods and nutrients. Nutritional fitness, which gauges the quality of a raw food according to its nutritional balance, appears to be widely dispersed over different foods, raising questions on the origins of such variations between foods. Remarkably, this nutritional balance of food does not solely depend on the characteristics of individual nutrients but is also structured by intimate correlations among multiple nutrients in their amounts across foods. This underscores the importance of nutrient-nutrient connections, which constitute the network structures embodying multiple levels of the nutritional compositions of foods. Extending our analysis beyond raw foods to cooked foods is necessary to truly understand the nutritional landscape of the foods we consume daily (and is left for further study); however, considering only raw foods was sufficient to draw primary insights from a relatively simple system.A number of applications would become achievable if the concepts presented here are judiciously combined with other practical approaches. The incorporation of region-specific information in our analysis may help design strategies for international food aid [24]. To develop such strategies, one can consider the prioritization of regional foods based on nutritional fitness, suggestions for locally-available dietary substitutes from a food-food network, the fortification of foods using bottleneck nutrients, and so forth. Our study also has implications for personalized nutrition [25]. People of different ages, genders, body compositions, health states, and physical activity levels can obtain their condition-specific information through our method, by simply adjusting the required calorie and nutrient intakes when generating irreducible food sets (S1 Appendix, Section 4.1). The resulting irreducible food sets allow one to compute the nutritional fitness and bottleneck nutrients. This information can be of particular interest to individuals with certain dietary requirements, such as pregnant women, who are recommended to take more nutrients, e.g., essential amino acids and vitamins, than non-pregnant women [26]. On the other hand, it would be interesting to check how different farming methods for each food affect the food’s nutritional composition and thereby its nutritional fitness. Currently, our data source does not provide such information about farming methods (S1 Dataset). Furthermore, considerations of food taste and financial, seasonal, and cultural factors in our analysis may improve the applicability of our methods towards nutritional policy making, nutrition education, and food marketing [1], [27], [28], as well as the aforementioned food aid and personalized nutrition. Finally, our systematic approach sets the foundation for future endeavors to enhance the understanding of food and nutrition.']"

2017-05-18T00:00:00Z,Quality of nutrition services in primary health care facilities: Implications for integrating nutrition into the health system in Bangladesh,"['The aim of the NNS, integrating nutrition services into the routine healthcare service delivery contacts, was an ambitious objective. Improving the logistics of providing appropriate equipment and the coverage of training may improve nutrition service delivery. However, there are inherent barriers to implementing nutrition services through the health system including high caseloads, resulting in shorter consultations during ANC and management of sick under-five children. Gestational age specific nutritional counselling package for ANC visits can maximise the efficiency. Missed opportunities to identify undernourished children and lack of time to provide preventive counselling messages can be overcome by introducing well-child clinics in the community or prioritizing home based nutritional screening and counselling by domiciliary workers. Alternative service delivery modes need to be considered including NGOs and other development partners who have demonstrated commitment to nutrition.']"
2015-10-21T00:00:00Z,To See or Not to See: Do Front of Pack Nutrition Labels Affect Attention to Overall Nutrition Information?,"['Our work strongly supports the idea that FOP labels are effective at garnering attention to nutrition information. The added presence of color-coded FOP labels on food packages attracted attention to nutrition information more rapidly and increased the total time that people spent attending to any nutrition information. However, we also found that FOP labels can be used, under certain situations, as a short-cut, thereby decreasing people’s attention to the more comprehensive information found in the NFP. For the scenarios considered in this study, we found no evidence that the presence of FOP labels primed attention to the comprehensive nutrition information on the NFP. These findings have practical implications for policy. First, our finding that FOP labels can, under some circumstances, reduce attention to comprehensive information in the NFP, suggests that any attempt to standardize FOP labels should ensure that that the most important information for making healthy choices appear in the FOP label. Conversely, this “short-cut” finding suggests that manufacturers should not be allowed to selectively report nutrition information on the front-of-pack, as it has the potential to mislead consumers. However, we believe that the attentional benefits of the FOP outweigh the potential negatives. FOP labels produced a dramatic increase in the speed with which people attended to nutrition information, and increased the overall amount of time spent attending to nutrition information. Moreover, the existing literature suggests that FOP labels may not act as a short-cut when people are explicitly interested in nutrition information [54] and that these labels can catalyze more healthful choices [61] for a sustained period of time [56]. Given the magnitude of the evidence that too few people currently attend to nutrition information [62], raising awareness, even to partial nutrition information, constitutes a step towards fostering informed food choices and potentially impacting overall dietary quality.In short, FOPs are likely to increase attention to nutrition information among the common shopper who is not explicitly interested in nutrition information. However, the information that appears within the FOP may be particularly influential when evaluating the health of the food, so regulators must carefully consider the type of information that should appear within a standardized FOP.']"

For this, it's important that nutrition studies and, more importantly, control interventions take into account this spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of nutritional deficits and their underlying associated factors. Thus, geographically targeted nutritional interventions might be more efficient and cost-effective in southern Ethiopia and, by extension, in similar settings. The findings of this study also indicated that interventions integrating household food insecurity in nutrition programs in the district might help to avert the burden of stunting.""]"
2019-06-20T00:00:00Z,Test-retest reliability of the Mini Nutritional Assessment and its relationship with quality of life in patients with stroke,"['Our results showed that the MNA had satisfactory test-retest reliability, indicating that the MNA is reliable in repeatedly assessing the nutritional status of patients with stroke. The MDC of the MNA has acceptable random measurement error which is useful for determining whether the change score of a patient is outside the range of random measurement error. Improving the nutritional status of patients with stroke would be beneficial because nutritional status is significantly correlated with QOL. Our findings provide useful information that could help clinicians in the process of planning nutritional interventions.']"
2016-08-23T00:00:00Z,Continental-Scale Patterns Reveal Potential for Warming-Induced Shifts in Cattle Diet,"['In all, given the geographic patterns in diet, it appears that as climates warm, cattle will respond in part by increasing their relative consumption of protein from high-protein eudicots to compensate for declines in protein concentrations in grasses. As protein concentrations appear to have already been declining in grasslands for decades due to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations [38], warming and elevated CO2 concentrations are likely reinforcing nutritional stress in cattle, though the degree to which cattle nutritional stress may have increased is currently unquantified. Monitoring the diet of cattle likely will be an important component in responding to climate-induced nutritional stresses as increases in forb component of diets might indicate elevated nutritional stress. Mitigating nutritional stress will likely require altered management practices such as promoting high-protein plant species, altered use of fire [39], or increasing protein concentrations of grasses, possibly through fertilization. With increases in eudicot percentages in diets, more attention will need to be paid to the role of secondary compounds in dietary selection and nutrition [6]. Given the patterns observed here, some management practices, such as broad-scale application of herbicides to reduce eudicot abundance, might be deleterious nutritionally and an improper response to reduced nutritional quality of forage.']"
2016-03-09T00:00:00Z,Pregnancy Requires Major Changes in the Quality of the Diet for Nutritional Adequacy: Simulations in the French and the United States Populations,"['Pregnancy tends to markedly widen the nutritional gap. The decrease in the nutritional adequacy of observed diets of women of childbearing age cannot be solved by a simple increase in energy intake, as recommended in some countries. A relatively good nutritional adequacy in pregnant women can therefore not be simply attributed to a higher energy intake, but to qualitative changes in the diet. Recommendations of snack additions from public health agencies make a somewhat limited and an extremely variable contribution to tackling the nutritional gap during pregnancy. These results call for dedicated studies to define the most theoretically efficient dietary counselling during pregnancy on a methodologically sound basis, either as generic counselling for the whole population or as tailor-fitted advice at the individual level, to improve the nutritional adequacy of the diet which is jeopardized at this specific, critical stage of the life cycle.']"
2019-05-10T00:00:00Z,Correlates and inequality of underweight and overweight among women of reproductive age: Evidence from the 2016 Nepal Demographic Health Survey,"['In Nepal, age and wealth quintiles are most strongly associated with both under- and over nutrition. Underweight is concentrated amongst young, poorer women whilst overweight and obesity is concentrated in wealthier subgroups. Development of equity-based health and nutrition programmes are needed whilst improving the socio-economic status of the poor in order to see major reductions in undernutrition in Nepal; especially targeting adolescents and young women. Tailored interventions for prevention of overweight/obesity as women age and in the higher wealth quintiles are also urgent, but nutrition education for all would also be beneficial. In the new federal system, local governments should develop nutrition specific and nutrition sensitive interventions to mobilize local resources for addressing the multi-dimensional issues that pre-dispose women to be under and over-nourished.']"
2017-04-26T00:00:00Z,"Maternal perception of children's nutritional status in the Federal District, Brazil","[""The present study found a high prevalence of maternal misperception of child's nutritional status. Moreover, highly educated mothers, mothers of boys, and mothers of non-overweight children were more likely to underestimate child's nutritional status. On the other hand, younger mothers, mothers of girls, and mothers of overweight children were more likely to overestimate child's nutritional status.Thus, in view of the complexity of the topic and the low correspondence between maternal perception and child's nutritional status, there is a need for interventions that take into account the relevance of mother's role and that help her recognize the nutritional status of her children appropriately. It is also worth highlighting that the implementation of strategies to prevent or treat childhood overweight should be focused not only on children but also on their mothers, providing guidance to help promote an accurate view of a healthy weight for their children.""]"
2016-09-20T00:00:00Z,What Explains Cambodia’s Success in Reducing Child Stunting-2000-2014?,"['The framework for the analysis of child nutrition in terms of immediate, underlying and basic causes has underpinned most empirical studies on improvements in child nutrition in developing countries. However, to understand the child nutrition transitions in developing countries, the determinants derived from this framework need to be modelled flexibly, allowing their impacts to vary across the distribution of child nutrition outcomes, over time and between rural and urban areas. A flexible modelling approach can provide a more nuanced understanding of child nutrition transitions, as the important drivers for change may be different for severely stunted children and moderately stunted children and for rural and urban areas. The returns to the conventional determinants–the translation of household endowments, characteristics and practices into gains in child nutrition–may be influenced by macroeconomic factors and shocks. The conventional determinants may not fully or adequately explain changes in child nutrition in developing countries, which highlights the need to explicitly consider the role of targeted child health and nutrition interventions. The main insights from the analysis can inform the design of policy and programme interventions. Nutrition interventions need to focus on the determinants that have the largest impact in the lower quantiles of the child HAZ score distribution to reduce the incidence of stunting. Further, the nature of interventions may need to be different in rural and urban areas. Maternal best practices and parental education appear to be the most promising areas for intervention in rural areas, whereas improvements in socio-demographic endowments like wealth may produce a larger impact in urban areas. Importantly, policy makers need to consider the efficacy with which conventional determinants translate into improvements in child HAZ scores and on the macro-economic developments and public health infrastructure that influence this efficacy. While targeted child nutrition interventions may be making a larger contributions to reduction in stunting, there is very limited data at present on the coverage, quality and impacts of these programmes in most developing countries. Empirical impact assessments of these interventions should be a priority area for future research.']"

2019-02-28T00:00:00Z,Mother’s nutrition-related knowledge and child nutrition outcomes: Empirical evidence from Nigeria,"['The determinants of child nutrition outcomes explored in this study have great policy implications for Nigeria and are also applicable to other countries with similar characteristics. The findings emanating from this study improve our understanding of the independent role that mother’s nutrition-related knowledge can play on child nutrition outcomes. Mother’s knowledge of food choices, feeding, and health care seeking are vital for producing good nutrition outcomes for young children. The present level of mother’s educational attainment in rural Nigeria is not sufficient to reinforce knowledge in producing better nutrition outcomes for children. In such populations with limited access to formal education, mother’s knowledge of health and nutrition may substitute for education in reducing undernutrition in young children. Particular effort should therefore be made to ensure this knowledge is rightly acquired. Other means of knowledge acquisition for mothers who do not have a formal education or cannot complete education above primary school should be employed. More importantly, programs should identify which child care practices should be encouraged to enhance maternal and child nutrition and health; promoting such could mitigate the negative association of mother’s lack of education with children’s health. Finally, adult education through behavioral change communications would be an effective means for reaching out to poor and less educated Nigerian women.']"
2019-06-24T00:00:00Z,Impact of early protein and energy intakes on neurodevelopment at 2 years of corrected age in very low birth weight infants: A single-center observational study,"['Among a single-center cohort of VLBW infants over a three-year period, a higher early protein intake and non-protein energy intake were associated with higher odds of neurodevelopmental impairment at 2 years’ corrected age. This highlights the contradictory hypothesis that greater protein intakes in early life improve neurodevelopmental outcome like previous studies. However, these results confirm the recent recommendation to decrease amino acid intakes published in the latest ESPGHAN guidelines. When the standard nutrition is below optimal, providing more nutrition may be beneficial. Nevertheless, providing nutrition above the optimal level may not be beneficial and may even be harmful. This study also confirms the strong relationship from neonatal comorbidities to early providing nutrition with an influence on later neurodevelopmental outcome. Further studies are necessary to improve our knowledge and nutritional practices in VLBW infants.']"

Based on this analysis, multiple factors associated with child undernutrition, child factors include Sex of child (male), Child age in months, and episodes of diarrhea. Mothers’ nutritional status and maternal education, were also associated with undermatron of their children. Poorest households’ wealth index was a factor associated with increased risk of undernutrition while the administrative region that the children reside was a community-level factor contributing to under-nutrition.

2019-09-10T00:00:00Z,A qualitative study to understand how Ebola Virus Disease affected nutrition in Sierra Leone—A food value-chain framework for improving future response strategies,"['This study underscores the magnitude of this EVD outbreak, which considerably impacted Sierra Leone’s food value-chain, negatively affecting food availability and food access across regions. At the policy level, adequate investments in improved emergency outbreak preparedness across the food value-chain may put nutritional health systems in more timely and coordinated positions to address not only the direct threat of an infectious disease but also the indirect toll that poor nutrition takes on community health. At the organizational level, nutrition programme planners should ensure necessary resources and capacity to ensure a combination of nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive response options prioritizing community involvement in design, coordination, and implementation across the food value-chain. These important lessons learned should be adapted to other contexts, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, where a very similar EVD outbreak has been occurring since 2018 [52]. Disasters of this magnitude may unavoidably face food security challenges, yet taking an interdisciplinary approach by convening experts from disciplines across the value chain for preparedness planning, for instance, may help to mitigate such widespread nutrition effects in similar complex emergencies.']"
2017-04-06T00:00:00Z,Higher fish but lower micronutrient intakes: Temporal changes in fish consumption from capture fisheries and aquaculture in Bangladesh,"['The valuable role of aquaculture in Bangladesh in securing the availability and affordability of fish is unquestionable. If growth in this sector had not occurred, declines in nutrient intakes described here would undoubtedly be much more severe, with far more serious implications for nutrition and health. However, the results presented here highlight unintended negative consequences of policy decisions and agricultural investments which are narrowly focused on maximising production and productivity. In doing so, our results challenge the dominant rhetoric that increases in food supply automatically lead to improvements in diet and nutrition. These findings are of significance to many countries experiencing rapid growth in aquaculture alongside declining quantity and diversity of species from capture fisheries. In this light, whilst the findings are specific to Bangladesh, it is possible that this decline of nutritional quality linked to a shift towards greater farmed fish consumption, is occurring on a global scale. As aquaculture becomes an increasingly important food source for many, it must embrace a nutrition-sensitive approach, by considering how changes in food supply affect nutritional quality of diets. To do so requires greater knowledge of the nutritional value of indigenous foods at species/varietal level, and the contributions these foods make in terms of nutrient intakes and dietary patterns, specific to age and sex groups, as well as to differences in rural/urban locations and geographic regions. Indicators used in the monitoring and evaluation of agricultural interventions must go beyond production and productivity, to also include nutritional quality. If the intrinsically linked issues of poverty, food insecurity and malnutrition are to be truly addressed; and for the SDGs to be achieved, agricultural policies must integrate strategies to mitigate trade-offs across multiple sectors, including (but not limited to) nutrition and health.']"

2017-08-22T00:00:00Z,Ecological stoichiometry of the honeybee: Pollen diversity and adequate species composition are needed to mitigate limitations imposed on the growth and development of bees by pollen quality,"['\nThe feeding strategy of a pollen eater contrasts with the strategies of other herbivores due to the exceptional nutritional richness of pollen.\nParticular honeybee castes and sexes differ in stoichiometry and need to incorporate various proportions of elements during development; therefore, different castes and sexes experience different stoichiometric mismatches and must be provided with appropriate and balanced combinations of nutrients in their food.\nThe nutritional elements that limit honeybee development to the highest degree due to their scarcity in pollen are Na, S, Cu, P and K. Zn and N were determined to be possibly limiting for bees.\nNot all plants produce pollen that satisfies the nutritional requirements of bees with respect to the required proportions of elements. Pollen eaters may not be able to stoichiometrically balance their diets without access to pollen species that are rich in limiting elements. Floral diversity may allow all of the necessary nutritional elements to be gathered in the appropriate proportions. Thus, a diverse flora is needed for bee development.\nParticular plant species that satisfy the nutritional requirements of bees may play greater roles than other species in stoichiometrically balancing the diets of pollen eaters. These taxa should be promoted in intervention strategies aimed at improving the nutritional base for pollen eaters, regardless of the amounts of nectar and pollen produced. We propose clover as such a stoichiometrically balanced taxon for bees.\nSingle-species crop plantations might limit bee development even if the crops are rich in nectar and pollen. Sunflower may negatively affect bees’ growth and development because of the scarcity of P in its pollen.\nThere is a need for data that allow the comparison of taxonomic, environmental, and soil nutritional status factors that may influence the elemental composition and stoichiometry of pollen.\n']"

Furthermore, iodine intake as indicated by urinary iodine concentrations was either too low or too high in over half of the children. Although the low rate of stunting in the population suggests adequate nutrition during the first years of life, the prevalence of thinness going up to almost 20% remains alarming. The study highlighted that the transition from home meals in the pre-school period to self-catering at school is most likely the basis for these multiplex of nutritional problems. The study therefore stresses the need for nutritional interventions to improve dietary quality and quantity of school children in Senegal.']"

However, the intervention, which used a participatory, locally-appropriate, video-based approach and targeted women’s groups, was well received by rural communities and viewed as complementary to existing frontline health services. Key lessons learned include the benefits of and need for collaboration with existing health services to couple programming with ongoing nutrition-specific activities; continued technical support for implementing partners to ensure accuracy of nutrition content; engagement with local cultural norms and beliefs to support positive MIYCN-related behaviour change; empowerment of women’s group members to strengthen their participation during and beyond the intervention lifecycle; and enhancement of message diffusion mechanisms to reach pregnant women and mothers of young children at scale.

The micro-geographic disparities widened with increasing education mothers achieved. The association of maternal education with child nutritional status may vary by micro-geographic locations, with a negative association in mountain areas and positive associations in plain and in edge areas, respectively. Thus, enlarging female education alone is not sufficient; improving unfavorable conditions in mountain areas can make such investments more effective in promoting child health. Moreover, malnutrition in plain and in edge areas continues to be of concern, and effective targeting of nutrition programs to the least educated groups in plain and in edge areas will be critical to their cost-effectiveness.']"

We identified a significant tradeoff between nutrients and toxins in the selection of individual trees at a small-spatial scale and found that available N was the key to understanding the selection of some trees. We argue that taxonomic and phenotypic diversity is likely to be important when foraging in habitats of low nutritional quality providing diet choice to tradeoff nutrients and toxins and minimise movement costs. Our findings support the assertion that immediate nutritional concerns are an important priority of folivores in low-quality habitats and imply that nutritional limitations play an important role in constraining folivore populations.']"

The use of food sales data has great potential when it comes to evaluating some food policy interventions, including tracking the nutritional quality of the food supply and assessing how individual food companies are responding to mandatory or voluntary targets. However, researchers using these data should be fully aware of their limitations and contextualise their findings accordingly.

However, the prevalence of stunting is very high and it is considered as a major public health concern among school-aged children in Arba Minch HDSS, Southern Ethiopia. The likelihood of stunting was significantly higher among older school age children and children who were non-enrolled in schools. Being male, and living in households with lower wealth index were also associated with increased odds of stunting. Therefore, this finding warrants the need to implement school health and nutrition programs to improve the nutritional status of school-age children in the study area. The interventions should focus towards both gender and special emphasis should also be given to increase the enrollment of children in schools. In addition, effort should be taken by stakeholders in different hierarchies to improve the family wealth status.

2016-04-13T00:00:00Z,"Nutritional Deficiencies, the Absence of Information and Caregiver Shortcomings: A Qualitative Analysis of Infant Feeding Practices in Rural China","[""Our results suggest shortcomings in the understanding of basic knowledge on infant weaning and on overall health and nutrition among rural caregivers, this may lead to poor complementary feeding practices that in turn may contribute to the high prevalence of malnutrition and iron-deficiency anemia among rural infants in China. Though poor complementary feeding is prevalent in poor areas of rural China, our qualitative findings suggest that poverty itself does not constrain feeding practices and caregivers attempt to provide for their children as best as they can. Therefore, the absence of nutritional knowledge needs to be addressed by future policies in order to improve long-run health and human capital outcomes in China.In order to combat the high prevalence of inadequate feeding practices, we suggest implementing nutritional campaigns targeted at caregivers of young children in rural China that focus primarily on promoting micronutrient supplementation. Such an educational campaign can be carried out by local government workers who have established positive relationships with villages and therefore would be a trusted source that caregivers could turn to when seeking nutritional information. Implementing such a measure can both increase caregivers' access to reliable sources of information, and their knowledge of infant and child nutrition. By doing so, these measures may effectively combat some of the most serious impediments to proper children's feeding practices and consequently their nutritional status, health, growth and development in rural China.""]"

This study is one of the first to compare ecosystem-specific brown bear diets based on the relative sources of digestible energy and protein for several interior populations. Noticeable differences in the nutritional parameters of brown bear diets were observed among several interior ecosystems, and the patterns observed suggest that individual body size and population density may be influenced by the availability of protein early in the season (by supporting lean mass gain and lactation) and the availability of energy late in the season (by supporting fat mass gain before hibernation).Small changes in the availability of highly nutritious foods have important effects on the nutritional quality of bear diets, such as the reduction or loss of terrestrial meats, trout and pine nuts in the GYE. Changes in nutritional quality will have an even greater impact when food availability and foraging efficiency do not permit increased consumption of less nutritious foods to offset the reduction in nutritional quality. Due to the importance of the nutritional conditions on bear fitness [12, 73] and population productivity [39, 44], monitoring food availability and foraging and dietary patterns of brown bears should be a permanent part of management programs.']"

The results show findings for the UK but the same methodology could be applied to any country with detailed food composition data. The study also provides an alternative view of self-sufficiency by looking at the dependence on imports to meet population-level nutritional requirements, rather than viewing self-sufficiency from an economic perspective. The concept of self-sufficiency could be broadened from a unidimensional perspective to include multiple factors, such as economics and nutrition security. As an approach to determine nutrition security at a national level, this study provides a method to monitor the progress toward delivering some of the sustainable development goals in terms of a national supply of sufficient nutrients to meet population requirements.']"

Although this sampling is meaningful because nutrition deficiency is quite prevalent in Dakar, Senegal, due to rapid urbanization and increasing food prices [32], in future studies, it is necessary to check for regional differences in results by including mothers residing in urban and rural areas.Second, our findings are subject to the limitations inherent in cross–sectional data.

The findings suggest that many practitioners do not routinely ask their patients about smoking status, nor do they provide counseling with regard to smoking cessation; younger optometrists (20 to 29 years of age) were less likely to enquire about smoking behaviors than older practitioners. Overall, optometrists tended to provide patient advice in relation to diet and nutritional supplementation slightly more regularly than for smoking. Almost two-thirds of respondents indicated routinely counseling patients about their diet; practitioners who consumed nutritional supplements themselves were no more likely to discuss the use of dietary supplements with their patients. These findings highlight scope to improve patient-related guidance in relation to smoking, diet and nutritional supplementation in Australian optometric practice.']"

2015-07-08T00:00:00Z,Maternal Plane of Nutrition during Late Gestation and Weaning Age Alter Angus × Simmental Offspring Longissimus Muscle Transcriptome and Intramuscular Fat,"['Cow plane of nutrition during the last 105 days of gestation resulted in modest changes in the offspring longissimus muscle transcriptome. Among these genes the bioinformatics analysis revealed an inflammatory process in offspring born from cows with access to higher plane of nutrition. The greater intramuscular lipogenic response in those steers contributed to the effect. Irrespective of maternal nutrition, early weaning induced a robust activation of the lipogenic program accompanied by activation of the innate immune system. The latter also was related to the greater lipogenesis during the growing phase. Subsequently, during the finishing phase, alterations of genes in the Golgi complex organization suggest an inhibition of lipid droplet formation potentially diminishing intramuscular fat accumulation in the steers.When only genes affected by weaning age are considered, the inflammatory response detected at the end of the growing phase in early-weaned steers was similar to that observed when evaluating DEG affected by cow plane of nutrition; in that case with signs of adipose tissue inflammation for both, MPN and LPN steers. These mechanisms were more pronounced in early-weaned steers from cows fed low plane of nutrition probably because of the lower intramuscular fat (marbling) scores. Overall, results from this work underscore the need to conduct further studies to understand better the functional outcome of the transcriptome changes. Additional knowledge on molecular and functional outcomes induced by the combination of prenatal and postnatal nutritional management would help produce more efficient beef cattle and higher quality beef.']"

While vitamin supplementation is a temporary solution, improving individual knowledge and community access to iron absorption enhancing foods, particularly produce, is needed in this community. Offering health literacy and nutrition education interventions at an appropriate literacy level is one method of improving individual knowledge. Encouraging local tiendas to label nutrient-rich foods to promote the individual purchase of healthy foods by community members, is another feasible option. Additionally, promoting government assistance programs like Prospera in the community and implementing additional programs designed to improve nutrition and health literacy, in conjunction with ensuring access to nutritious foods, might serve as an additional mechanism to decrease the high prevalence nutritional anemia within the community. Evidence illustrates that reducing anemia prevalence rates among community members will require a multifaceted approach involving both individual and community aspects.']"

Grazing also affected herbage performance, in that herbage biomass decreased and herbage nutritive values increased with increasing stocking rate. The increase in herbage nutritive values by grazing could not compensate for the decrease in herbage biomass. Both precipitation and stocking rate were important factors in determining livestock LG. We conclude from our results that a moderate stocking rate of 1 yak ha-1, which provides 88% of the highest LG per ha, satisfies the demands for sustainable grazing management. However, other more developed grazing management strategies, such as rotation grazing, supplementary feeding in winter and yak turn over period from 4 years to 2 years, may also increase the biomass and nutritive value of herbage and animal LG in the winter. Implementation of such strategies may improve the sustainability of grassland use on the other parts of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau with the similar conditions.']"

However, a variety of food groups must be included in one’s diet to achieve adequate levels for the most important micronutrients, and nutrient-dense food groups such as fruit are associated with more micronutrients than less nutrient-dense groups. As some micronutrients showed inadequate intake levels, additional nutritional advice should be provided to avoid adverse effects resulting from personal dislike of certain food groups, and the consumption of beneficial foods (especially vegetables and legumes prepared in ways that are easy to digest) should be promoted as some of these groups, legumes in particular, were only consumed in minimal amounts. In addition, shorter time frames between nutritional advice are more successful than longer periods, such as one year.Food variety with special attention to nutrient-dense foods is especially important in players with low energy intake. Consequently, it might be necessary to use supplements for players with SCI, especially for micronutrients involved in bone health. Nutritional monitoring in Paralympic athletes should be incorporated into the regular routine of their training periods throughout the year so that a short time frame between repeated sessions of receiving nutritional advice can be used to raise their knowledge of the benefits of sports nutrition.']"
2016-03-10T00:00:00Z,Supply- and Demand-Side Factors Influencing Utilization of Infant and Young Child Feeding Counselling Services in Viet Nam,"['Health systems are increasingly paying more attention to nutrition and incorporating preventive nutrition interventions into health services delivery. In this context, especially where health services are often facility-based, optimal use of nutrition interventions and services is critical to ensuring impact. It is, therefore, important to understand and address the factors influencing utilization in order to ensure that beneficiaries receive the full range of nutrition services and maximize their benefits. We have provided a comprehensive investigation of demand- and supply-side factors that influence utilization, focusing on the full range of utilization patterns–from one-time use to repeated use and ultimately achievement of the minimum package of services. Demand-generation strategies and counselling skills were the most important factors associated with any service use; strengthening these two demand -and supply-side factors could markedly improve service utilization with an additional 49% of the population achieving the recommended minimum number of MTBT visits. Given the continued efforts to improve the impact of IYCF interventions and to scale up nutrition through health systems globally, our study contributes robust empirical evidence on potential factors to optimizing facility-based counselling service utilization in Viet Nam. Further research is needed to identify and test methods for increasing and sustaining reach and use of similar services in other contexts.']"

Due to this fact, we did not find a significant difference between home visits with a physical and nutritional intervention program and home visits with social support only. Further results indicate that also individuals with an advanced frailty status should be encouraged to do strength exercises in combination with a nutritional intervention.']"
2017-02-17T00:00:00Z,Energy intake and energy expenditure of pre-professional female contemporary dancers,"['To conclude this research demonstrates that, as with many athletes in aesthetic or weight dependent sports, female contemporary dancers are at risk of energy deficiency, particularly during periods of scheduled dance training. As a result, this population could be susceptible to the numerous health and performance impairments associated with energy imbalance. In addition appropriate macronutrient intakes are essential for maintaining the demands of training, performance and recovery. The suboptimal macronutrient intakes observed in this study suggest a lack of knowledge regarding appropriate nutrition for sport and exercise performance. It is evident that dance populations would benefit from further research in order to develop current understanding of dance specific nutrition. For instance the variability of nutritional intakes and energy expenditures between term time and off-season remain to be investigated, and whether the negative energy balance reported in the current study is maintained in the long-term. Moreover it may be prudent to investigate nutritional strategies and the use of ergogenic aids which may provide practical solutions to improve energy balance and perhaps contribute to enhancing performance and recovery.']"
2019-04-26T00:00:00Z,Common garden experiment reveals altered nutritional values and DNA methylation profiles in micropropagated three elite Ghanaian sweet potato genotypes,"['Here we show that micropropagation reduces the nutritional value of sweet potato tubers and that micropropagated plants are both genetically and epigenetically dissimilar from field maintained plants. The higher levels of variability in the nutritional composition and of molecular diversity observed within micropropagated plants makes tempting the speculation that there is a direct relation between both. Regardless, the anonymous nature of the MSAP markers, used here to characterize somaclonal variation at a molecular level, does not allow us to asseverate that the detected DNA methylation polymorphisms are the drivers of the observed loss in nutritional value. Future studies should consider using a Next Generation Sequencing approach to identify those genes associated with the differentially methylated loci, as well as analyzing the gene transcriptional differences between field and in vitro maintained sweet potato tubers. Still, our results provide a useful start point from which to assemble a more comprehensive picture of the functional role of in vitro culture induced DNA methylation changes affecting the nutritional value of biofortified crops. More importantly, since future sweet potato biofortification plans include the use of in vitro culture to generate disease free propagules, our findings highlight the importance of including an assessment of the impact of micropropagation on nutritional values, with a special focus on beta-carotene content, of any novel biofortified sweet potato cultivar prior to their commercial release, to avoid the catastrophic costs to the industry previously seen with other in vitro propagated crops [50].']"
2017-02-09T00:00:00Z,Evaluation of the nutritional status of workers of transformation industries adherent to the Brazilian Workers’ Food Program. A comparative study,"['In conclusion, the results obtained in the present study, which assessed anthropometric measures of the nutritional status of workers benefited by the Workers’ Food Program, revealed statistically significant differences between mean BMI and waist circumference of the non-WFP and WFP group. One positive finding was the lower level of consumption of sodium and saturated fat among WFP workers, indicating a favorable association of the WFP with the nutritional intake of the population served by the program. Therefore, from a public health perspective, we believe that these results provide an important contribution by showing how an initiative by a central Government can contribute effectively to improving the nutritional status of a vulnerable population group in nutritional terms, without the need for the allocation, mobilization and direct application of national funds. In this sense, these results might encourage other countries, with similar population groups in vulnerable situations, to find in this model of public policy one way to combat the hunger and malnutrition, following the example of Brazil.On the other hand, our study also demonstrated, for the first time, a higher cardiovascular risk among WFP workers, as reflected by a larger waist circumference. Consequently, our results make a strong point toward the need of periodically revisiting the WFP and redefining its goals according to the changing nutritional status of the target population of the program, in order to help workers maintain a body weight within healthy limits.']"

Extensive characterization of water- and fat-soluble vitamins in the phytococktail was carried out with RRLC-tandem mass spectrometry. The proposed process was simple, low-cost and rapid, with high sensitivity, reproducibility, robustness and time-efficiency which can be useful in the determination of vitamins in a variety of food supplements, pharmaceutical preparations, fortified beverages and complicated food matrices. The free amino acid profile of the phytococktail revealed the presence of 8 essential amino acids that are important for human nutrition. The phytocoktail was also found to contain substantial amount of omega-7 MUFA (palmitoleic acid), omega-9 MUFA (oleic acid), SFA (palmitic acid) and small quantity of carboxylic acid (linoleic acid), suggesting that the phytococktail could become an important natural source of fatty acids suitable for health promotion and disease prevention. The phytococktail could thus be considered as a prospective functional food that may offer potential health benefits. The information of nutritional profile in the phytococktail holds great significance from both dietary and nutritional aspects of human in the extreme high altitude environment. Finally, it can be concluded that the phytococktail could be a high value nutritional phytofood as it contains multiple vitamins, essential amino acids, fatty acids and dietary minerals to provide great health benefit.']"
2017-10-26T00:00:00Z,Ethical issues in the development and implementation of nutrition-related public health policies and interventions: A scoping review,"['The results of this review illustrate the various natures, types, and scopes of existing (or planned) public health nutrition-related interventions, the widely differing contexts in which they are implemented, and the array of ethical issues that may arise. Ethical issues can only be addressed by taking into consideration the complexities of each specific setting. As a consequence, while general ethical frameworks or recommendations that follow from such consideration are certainly useful to draw attention to these issues, they cannot be expected to provide policy makers, implementors and other public health personnel with sufficient practical ethical guidance on how to achieve such goals in complex settings and specific public health nutrition interventions.This scoping review also illustrates the methodological challenges that must be faced when conducting such a review and constitutes a needed and useful step in the design and achievement of future research seeking to identify ethical issues that are raised by nutrition-related public health interventions and in the development of ethical frameworks for policy makers and health professionals. We suggest that, given the complexity and diverse natures of interventions and contexts in the field of public health nutrition, future reviews should focus solely on specific interventions, without limiting their search to articles or studies that explicitly address ethical issues. Every item in the sample of publications should then be reviewed and analyzed in order, first, to identify ethical issues, addressed or not and, second, potential gaps in existing recommendations and guidelines relating to that specific nutrition-related intervention.']"
2014-05-20T00:00:00Z,Poor Nutrition Status and Associated Feeding Practices among HIV-Positive Children in a Food Secure Region in Tanzania: A Call for Tailored Nutrition Training,"['In conclusion, HIV-positive children attending care and treatment centers in Tanga, a region with adequate food production, had poor nutrition statuses and low feeding frequency and dietary diversity scores. Low feeding frequency was associated with stunting, underweight, and thinness. Factors associated with low feeding frequency included low wealth index, low maternal or caregiver education, household food insecurity, and acute respiratory tract infections in the past six months.To ameliorate the high burden of undernutrition among HIV-positive children, feeding practices, in particular feeding frequency, should be improved even in areas where food production is high and food is available at low cost. To achieve this, more focused interventions may be necessary to help HIV-positive children in those households that face high food insecurity, poverty, and low education of caregivers. Nutrition training of health workers can help provide this support, reduce misconceptions regarding healthy foods [63], and help caregivers utilize efficiently and well the vast food availability in the region [3]. Nutrition counseling may also teach methods of food storage households who are affected by food insecurity but live in food rich regions [22]. Frequent nutrition counseling can help to guide such families into proper use of available resources including foods and give priorities to children with high nutritional demand.']"
2018-04-25T00:00:00Z,The timing of growth faltering has important implications for observational analyses of the underlying determinants of nutrition outcomes,"['Despite the broader programmatic influence of seminal research on the importance of growth faltering and wasting in the first 1000 days of life [1, 2], experimental and observational research on linear growth and wasting often only measures partial exposure to underlying determinants of interest without paying due attention to the different age dynamics of growth faltering as defined by HAZ and WAZ or by HAD. The results in this study show that the multivariable regression associations between these indicators and various underlying determinants of nutrition using DHS data are very sensitive to age restrictions, with patterns entirely consistent with the partial exposure bias hypothesis.The clearest limitation of these results is that they are based on cross sectional observational data, implying that these coefficients could suffer from the omission of relevant confounding factors and various types of measurement error, and that any inferences on the dynamics of growth faltering and wasting must be inferred from comparisons across cohorts rather than within cohorts. However, the primary objective of our analysis was to gauge the sensitivity of findings inferred from an already extensive observational literature on the underlying determinants of nutrition. This literature exists because in contrast to the evidence base on specific nutrition programs, experimental evaluations of the nutritional impacts of many underlying factors are costly and difficult to implement. For example, assessing the nutritional impacts of parental schooling would require an extremely extensive and prolonged multi-generational experimental design [8]. Hence there are very few experimental studies assessing the nutritional impacts of programs targeting parental education, household income/assets, access to health services or family planning. In the absence of many such experiments, researchers and policymakers heavily rely on observational analyses to investigate these factors or to infer their role in modelling scenarios; this paper set out to assess how sensitive such analyses are to partial exposure bias.These findings have important implications for future research. For observational analyses of linear growth indicators, minimizing partial exposure bias in studies of underlying determinants generally requires focusing regression analysis on children aged 24 months or older who have completed the first 1000 days of heightened vulnerability to various nutritional insults. One necessary exception would be analyses of the associations between HAZ/stunting and children’s diets [34, 35], since the DHS now only measures dietary outcomes for children 0–23 months (previously many surveys had recorded this information for children 0–35 months). Yet even in this case researchers should test sensitivity to the use of older sub-samples (e.g. 18–23 months) and arguably use sub-samples of older children as the preferred result, as in [36]. Another exception would be analyses focused on specific stages of a child’s growth process, such as studies exploring determinants of postnatal HAZ and its associations with maternal nutrition or prenatal care.For analyses of WHZ or wasting, the opposite strategy is recommended: regression analyses should generally focus on children 0–23 months of age, since these children are much more vulnerable to the various recent insults that influence weight-based nutrition outcomes. At the very least, studies should stratify their analyses by appropriate age brackets, and acknowledge that partial exposure bias can be an important influence on estimated coefficients.These recommendations can easily be implemented with the data often collected in standard surveys. More indirectly, these results also have implications for experimental research and thus for the samples chosen or for the necessary duration of the studies. Nutrition-specific interventions often do give very close consideration to the age dynamics of stunting, but not always. For example, many analyses of nutrition-sensitive interventions, such as sanitation trials, often pay limited attention to this issue, especially when nutrition indicators constitute secondary outcomes of interest [27].These results have important implications for the policy messages inferred from existing research on the determinants of child nutrition, which mostly uses samples of children aged 0–59 months. Our findings suggest that many previous studies have underestimated the impacts of a wide range of underlying determinants on linear growth, particularly parental education and wealth, income and economic growth [4–7]. Interestingly, our analysis of the determinants of child weight for height also suggests that wealth and parental education have much stronger associations with WHZ and wasting in the more appropriate 0–23 month old sample.In summary, we argue that the analytical implications of children’s heightened vulnerability to nutritional insults in the first 1000 days of life have not been appropriately integrated into the large and influential literature engaged in observational analyses of the underlying determinants of child nutrition outcomes. Doing so yields important new results, with household wealth, parental education and many other underlying determinants having stronger associations with stunting and wasting than previous analyses would suggest.']"

Future randomized trials should aim at demonstrating that an early nutritional intervention in hospitalised patients identified with insufficient dietary intake would decrease the incidence of HCAI, and that this strategy is cost-effective.

2015-12-23T00:00:00Z,"Understanding the Rapid Reduction of Undernutrition in Nepal, 2001–2011","['This paper sought to understand rapid improvements in child nutrition in a remarkable success story. Despite large-scale conflict and political instability, Nepal achieved reduced stunting prevalence by 1.8 points per year from 2001 to 2011. Statistically, a number of factors convincingly account for this success.First, much of the improvement in child nutrition stems from improvements in birth size, with only a modest improvement in postnatal nutrition trajectories. Second, asset accumulation emerges as an important factor across all nutritional indicators. Interestingly, asset accumulation was very rapid, which is consistent with rapid growth in household income (S1 Text). Third, consistent with many other studies, educational improvements appear to be important. Specifically, though, we find only maternal education predicts improved child nutrition outcomes in Nepal. Fourth, revolutionary improvements in access to healthcare have played a large role in Nepal, with potentially important lessons for other developing countries. Major government programs have explicitly targeted ambitious improvements in antenatal, neonatal, and postnatal care through rapid expansion of health extension workers as well as financial incentives. Fifth, Nepal has achieved sizeable gains in sanitation, specifically in the reduction of open defecation. Indeed, it is possible that our model underestimates the contribution of improved sanitation because the DHS questions on toilet use do not identify when specific practices were adopted. Multi-country experimental evidence suggests that the impacts of toilet adoption are about twice as large as those estimated in this paper [30].The multi-dimensional and multi-sectoral nature of this change starkly emphasizes the point that rapid nutritional change seems chiefly to stem from simultaneous social and economic progress on multiple fronts [8–11; 31–32]. Indeed, our results for Nepal are strikingly similar to an analogous decomposition of nutritional change for Bangladesh [31], with the main except being a somewhat greater contribution of health services in Nepal. Together, these results suggest that emulating success stories requires overcoming some of the very challenging obstacles to achieving success on multiple fronts, including more effective inter-sectoral coordination.']"

These unacceptably high maternal malnutrition estimates in Africa stressed the need for priority interventions targeted to improve maternal nutrition during pregnancy. Investing on maternal malnutrition is also a key strategy to reduce LBW, PTB, and to break its inter-generational effect. Apart from socio-demographic and economic factors, maternal malnutrition has been affected by inadequate nutrient intake or poor nutritional indicators and multiple pregnancies.An optimal nutrient intake by the mothers is essential to meet both maternal and fetal requirements and reduce adverse health consequences in addition to spaced pregnancy.

More than half of the women had inadequate weight gain in the third trimester. The deficiencies in their overall health and nutritional status were corroborated by the high prevalence of stunting and anemia. Maternal characteristics such as short stature, low BMI, advanced age, parity, being Hindu, intake of arsenic-contaminated water, low level of education and socioeconomic status, and conceiving during monsoon or dry season were the risk factors for inadequate third-trimester weight gain.Particular attention should be given during prenatal care to women with the risk factors identified in this study. Short stature is an important determinant of poor weight gain during pregnancy, and as it indicates chronic malnutrition, nutrition during childhood and adolescence has to be focused in addition to prenatal nutrition. Prenatal nutritional intake should be improved. In addition to promoting female education, counseling for food taboos during pregnancy may be helpful.

Our findings suggest that age is the factor most strongly associated with PUD in Korean adults, that obesity is associated with PUD, that the association between nutritional components and PUD is greater in women than in men, and that there are few relationships between blood parameters and PUD. In summary, our main findings are as follows. 1) Increased age was a strong risk factor for PUD in both Korean women and men. 2) In anthropometric indices related to obesity, decreased weight, BMI, and HipC values corresponded to an elevated risk of PUD in Korean women, and decreased HipC values corresponded to an increased risk of PUD in Korean men. 3) Regarding nutritional components, increased intake of dietary calcium decreased the risk of PUD in women, but not in men. Additionally, increased intake of dietary fiber, ash, sodium, and vitamin B2 decreased the risk of PUD in women. These results indicate that anthropometrics, lifestyle, and nutrition could play a significant role in PUD in Korean adults. Furthermore, the findings provide useful information for PUD screening tools and could improve public health efforts to address PUD.']"

Issues such as lack of some micronutrients, which is highly prevalent in children, require policies that need to be pursued more seriously. Precise formulation and implementation of breastfeeding programs, complementary nutrition, and therapeutic supplementation for children, and fortification and sumpplementation for mothers should receive priority in this regard. The advantages and capabilities of each region are among the most important elements to be considered in policies. The use of ethnic and local foods in each region, correction of malnutrition, and promotion of nutritional literacy should be considered in different areas. Furthermore, given the fact that the policies of different organizations affect each other and lack of coordination between these policies may affect the success of the overall policies adopted, there is a strong need for more cooperation to materialize macro objectives.']"

During larval development, xylophagous beetles are confronted with a severe nutritional imbalance caused by poor digestibility of food and its stoichiometric mismatch with the beetles' bodies.2. These nutritional constraints are partly offset by the adjusted life histories of xylophages, with a development time extended to a couple of years. The life histories of dimorphic sexes and various species exploiting the same resources may differ, but computational simulations show that the prolongation of the development time is not sufficient to accumulate nutrients in adequate amounts.3. The nutritional balance of growing xylophagous larvae can be maintained due to the substantial enrichment of dead wood with nutrients imported from the outside by the mycelium of saprotrophic fungi.4. The fungal transfer of essential nutrients from the soil into the wood of dead trees is of fundamental importance for maintaining the detrital food web in forest ecosystems.""]"

2015-05-20T00:00:00Z,Investment in Constitutive Immune Function by North American Elk Experimentally Maintained at Two Different Population Densities,"['Comparisons of elk in high- and low-density populations indicated that as population density of elk increased, nutritional condition declined and individuals increased investment in constitutive immune function. Differences between individuals from different densities could have resulted because individuals in poor nutritional condition invested more in constitutive immune defenses, or because individuals from high-population densities had higher parasite loads causing induced immune responses. When considering differences in immune function and nutritional condition between individuals from different population densities and different age classes, our results provide stronger support for the hypothesis that animals in poorer nutritional condition invest more in constitutive immune defenses than animals in better nutritional condition. This strategy might allow elk in poorer condition to prevent the establishment of an infection and to avoid having to mount expensive adaptive immune responses. This intriguing hypothesis should be investigated further within the larger framework of the costs and benefits of immune responses.Our results also speak to the effects of density dependence on individual-level traits. Density-dependent mechanisms are mediated through intraspecific competition, via per capita availability of food and the subsequent influence of nutrition on reproduction and recruitment of young into the reproductive segment of the population [17–20]. As populations approach carrying capacity and resources become increasingly limited, some individuals do not gain adequate fat levels for both survival and reproduction; as a result, limited fat stores are allocated to survival over reproduction in slow-paced species, including elk [22, 42, 93–96]. Elk from the high-density population invested more in immune function than those from the low-density population, supporting our hypothesis that immune function is a trait that is mediated by population density. Our results support the premise that density-dependent regulation of immune function is important for understanding population demographics of species that show strong density dependence in their life histories.']"

2019-12-19T00:00:00Z,Maternal employment and child nutritional status in Uganda,"['In Uganda, maternal employment is a significant determinant of child nutritional status. Other significant determinants are region, maternal age and education, and child’s age and weight at birth. The most vulnerable children are those whose mothers belong to the low socioeconomic status, are young, reside in places that are food insecure and have low levels of education.Interventions to increase maternal labour force participation should advocate for flexible work schedules—so that mothers can either leave work earlier or report later to involve in childcare. This is likely to support exclusive and continued breastfeeding, and consequently improve retention of women in employment. Interventions to improve the socioeconomic situation and nutrition of the population should target Northern Uganda in order to neutralize the palpable effects of the war. The study underscores the importance of education in improving the lives of individuals and their children. Efforts towards ANC and skilled delivery should place more emphasis on nutrition education in the antenatal and postnatal periods, to sensitize mothers about the benefits and dietary content of proper child and maternal feeding, and mosquito net use to prevent malaria. These interventions should have special focus on young mothers. Further research is needed to explain the reasons for the poor nutritional indicators among these categories in Uganda.']"
2019-09-06T00:00:00Z,Gender effects of agricultural cropping work and nutrition status in Tanzania,"['Our results show that time spent in farm work is negatively correlated with nutritional status for non-overweight individuals, albeit of small magnitude. This implies that agricultural interventions should not ignore the implications of work intensities on nutrition. The improvement in nutrition from increased agricultural production may be offset by the increase in work effort required by agricultural work.Unfortunately, there are few datasets that contain information on labor inputs, other agricultural inputs, production, and nutrition of household members. In order to empirically test the six pathways outlined in the agriculture-nutrition pathways [3], it is recommended that agricultural datasets include information on nutrition, and that production data contain information on agricultural inputs, including labor.The BMI of farmers with certain agricultural equipment (such as a seed planter, hand-powered sprayer) decreased at a faster pace with time spent in crop production. However, while the BMI of male farmers with tractors had a positive correlation with time spent in land preparation and planting, it was negatively correlated with time spent harvesting. It is possible that access to machineries reduced effort for one production activity, but increased work for other activities in the production process, such as in harvesting. The BMI of women in households with hand powered sprayer is positively related to time spent in weeding, fertilizing, and non-harvest activities, while it is negatively correlated for men. Our results suggest that access to hand powered sprayer may have helped reduce women’s work in weeding, while this was not the case for men’s work in ridging and fertilizing but further disaggregation of activities in the dataset would have been helpful to understand this better.Increasing women and men’s access to mechanized farming tools could reduce women’s energy exertion and improve their nutritional status. But it is important to consider the impact it could have on time and energy costs of not just one production activity but of other activities. The introduction of new equipment should also account for the physical differences between women and men, and its implications on work burdens. For example, ergonomically-designed equipment catering to the women’s needs can reduce their workload and improve productivity [41]. When new technologies are introduced, men might take over the tasks previously assigned to women [25]. It is imperative to ensure that women do not lose control over the proceeds of the agricultural products they were previously responsible for. Further, mechanization could displace farmers who are poor and low skilled and consequently reducing their incomes and nutritional status.Further research on efficiently measuring energy requirements, especially in large surveys in developing countries, will add to the growing evidence base on this topic. Measuring the intensity, duration, and frequency of time use for different activities, in addition to individual-level food consumption, will be key to accurately capturing energy expenditure [42].']"
2017-12-12T00:00:00Z,Determinants of dietary diversity and the potential role of men in improving household nutrition in Tanzania,"['Food and nutrition insecurity remains a complex problem, mainly in rural areas in less developed countries such as Tanzania. Our study revealed that the diet among households lacked diversity, and that the intake of foods from animal sources (meat, poultry and offal, fish and seafood) was low, especially among the children and women. Women and children access a less diverse diet, since 46% and 26% achieved minimum dietary diversity respectively. Children under five and women in female-headed households had significantly low dietary diversity scores compared to those in the male-headed households. Vegetable production emerged as an important subsector in improving household dietary diversity, particularly for women. Additionally, gender and education of the household head, training on food and nutrition and size of land owned contribute to improved dietary diversity.Men can contribute towards improving household nutrition security by reducing their consumption of food away from home, particularly during food shortages, and using the money saved to purchase nutritious food for the household. Male farmers also could set aside a part of the produce harvested for household consumption rather than market sale. These actions could potentially reduce any form of malnutrition among children and women. Because most households depend on agriculture, awareness creation should focus on improving the production of vegetables and consumption of foods with superior micronutrient density for improved nutrition. Thus, there is a need to support community-based sensitization programs to provide information on food preparation, human nutrition, and the importance of growing vegetables for household consumption. Such programs should focus on encouraging men to actively participate in providing diversified diet to their households.']"

Child and maternal health and nutrition-related indicators has been improved over past few decades. The study summarizes that maternal mortality ratio (MMR), under-five mortality rate and neonatal mortality rate shows declining trend in Bangladesh. The current trend and future prediction of these indicators considered in this study support satisfactory development and on a track to reach national target of Bangladesh 2021. Further, more initiatives need to achieve related SDGs 2030.In spite of gaining a remarkable change in different public health indicators in Bangladesh, malnutrition is still a concerning issue for us. This study observed a decreasing trend in prevalence of stunting in Bangladesh, while and prevalence of wasting in recent years is increasing. The predicted percentage of stunting is higher than the national target-2021. Eventually if we do not take necessary steps, we will not be able to reach SDG target 2.2 about malnutrition. Assuring a sound maternal and child health of a country is essential for sound public health status of the country. Reductions in stunting and other forms of under nutrition can be achieved through proven interventions which include improving women’s nutrition, especially before, during and after pregnancy; early and exclusive breastfeeding; timely, safe, appropriate and high-quality complementary food; and appropriate micronutrient interventions. Progress on child and maternal nutrition is needed to reduce high levels of under nutrition on child survival, growth and development.In this study, maternal and child health indictors are analyzed. In further study, other health indicators like communicable and non-communicable diseases with their dependence with improved water and hygiene and sanitation could be analyzed using time series tools and techniques.

2015-10-16T00:00:00Z,Food Deprivation Affects the miRNome in the Lactating Goat Mammary Gland,"['The findings reported here highlight for the first time using high throughput miRNA sequencing, 30 known or predicted miRNA in the ruminant mammary gland which expression seems to be nutriregulated. Among these 30 potentially interesting miRNA, members of clusters and similar families were found. Five of them have already been reported as being affected by nutrition in other species and tissues. By investigating the genes they might target, some nutriregulated miRNA appear to be good candidates for further studies in mammary gland biology. For example, miR-494-3p, located in QTL associated with milk fat in cows, may be preponderant for milk lipid synthesis, notably through the regulation of PTEN, and in targeting mTOR, miR-99a-5p may regulate milk protein synthesis. The links between miRNA and DEG previously identified by transcriptomic assays show that 19 DEG may be targeted by nutriregulated miRNA. These observations highlighted two miRNA, miR-204-5p and miR-223-3p, whose expression was the most markedly affected by food deprivation and which may target several DEG, suggesting important roles for both miRNA in the nutritional regulation of gene expression in the mammary gland. Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to support our results and to decipher the function of these miRNA in mammary epithelial cells.MiRNA offer new insights to understand the impact of nutrition on the mammary gland and may help to clarify mammary gene regulation in order to modulate milk quality via nutrition. The nutrition model of food deprivation used in this study was a large challenge, so further studies should be performed with a diet that could be applied by livestock farmers in order to identify the nutriregulation of miRNA under breeding conditions.']"

2017-10-09T00:00:00Z,The impact of nutritional supplement intake on diet behavior and obesity outcomes,"['Our study shows that the propensity to consume nutritional supplements is a function of diet quality, health, demographic and lifestyle factors. Our findings also suggest a possible link between diet-health behavior (supplement intake) and obesity status as measured by BMI. Thus, consumers of diet supplements do show a lower BMI compared to non-takers. Given decreasing intake levels of fruits and vegetables, it is important to determine the role nutritional supplements play in health behavior and in determining diet quality outcomes.Indeed, we find that nutritional supplements intake may have a positive effect on diet quality of supplement consumers, which in turn may affect diet health outcome indicators, such as the BMI. However, the effect of supplement intake as an explicit health behavior does not significantly alter the levels of overall diet quality or any of its important sub-components observed in this study. This finding expands the results commonly found in consumer stated preference surveys on diet-health in that a direct linkage between preventative health behaviors and the consumption of fruits and vegetables exists [10].However, the estimated differences in obesity and diet quality outcomes between nutritional supplement takers and no-takers should not be interpreted as the causal effect of supplementation. Instead, the binary supplement intake variable in the PSM analysis represents a proxy of individual’s (supplement taker’s) health behaviour, which results in significant differences in the chosen outcomes when compared against a control (non-taker) population.The results of the analysis suggest that several health indicators, demographics, and lifestyle variables significantly affect the selection into the treatment group of nutritional supplement takers. Nutritional supplement intake is positively associated with a significantly lower BMI of above 1kg/ (body height in meters)2, when all other observable characteristics between supplement takers and non-takers are controlled for. We also found that supplement takers are likely to be white, highly educated, of higher household income, non-smokers and of overall higher health status.The findings reveal that food stamp recipients and lower income households do not take nutritional supplements, even though these two groups may be especially at-risk groups of failing to meet recommended intake levels for major fresh food categories (e.g. fresh fruits and vegetables). On the other hand, individuals of normal weight (individuals with a lower BMI) and individuals who consume more fruits were found to proactively hedge against health risks by consuming nutritional supplements a preventative measure for maintaining good health. One way to encourage consumption of nutritional supplements among at-risk groups would be to establish a health policy on consumption, especially with regards to fruits and vegetables and nutritional supplements, in order to target specific at-risk populations.Given the increasing importance of individuals’ dietary choices to consumer diet-health and public policy in the United States, accurate estimates of existing behaviors and their impacts on relevant health outcomes have become essential tools for the purpose of policy guidance. Moreover, greater general awareness of diet-health issues and trends toward proactive health behaviors have increased consumers’ demand for more products with identifiable health benefits (e.g. superfoods, functional foods). This trend towards “nutritionism” [77] demands significant adjustments on the side of stakeholders along many agri-food value chains. Given the recent volatility in the in the U.S. produce sector, growth opportunities related to diet-health trends should be of even greater important to the fresh fruit and vegetable industry. In this context knowledge of the determinants of nutritional supplement demand seems particularly essential.Finally, a key component in the quest for improving food policies is the improvement in analytical methods aimed at eliminating the self-selection bias and resulting mismeasurement commonly associated with working with cross-sectional observational data, such as NHANES. The econometric analysis carried out in this article contributes to the discussion regarding whether consuming supplements leads to positive diet-health outcomes. Appropriate methods such as treatment effects estimators (e.g. PSM) can provide more reliable insights into an individual’s diet and health behavior, which will provide the prerequisite for effective and efficient public policies.']"

Since supermarket users consume larger quantities of highly processed and energy-dense foods, we reckon that the nutrition and health effects are mainly driven by supermarkets influencing people’s dietary choices. This would mean that the rapid spread of supermarkets in developing countries directly contributes to the nutrition transition. However, premature judgements should be avoided, as supermarkets can also have positive effects for public health and development. We have highlighted new aspects and dimensions of the effects of supermarkets on nutrition and health in developing countries.

Both generate noteworthy results that can be used for evidence-informed decision and policy-making in the context of a growing interest in nutrition, and a parallel paucity of data on hidden hunger.In parallel, this analysis highlights an urgent need to invest in the updating of the VMNIS, so that it continues to gather frequent, nationally representative, high-quality micronutrient data for a large number of countries and for a wider range of micronutrients. Such data is critical to inform the policy and programmatic efforts needed to advance the global nutrition agenda, and to achieve MDGs 1, 4, and 5. Looking ahead, as we enter the post-2015 development agenda period and renew our efforts to scale-up nutrition, such a global micronutrient information system is critically important to provide the urgently needed data for monitoring and tracking progress in achieving the new sustainable development goals (SDGs).']"

These results suggest that protein leakage across the membrane may be a manifestation of a systemic or local inflammation and poor nutritional status, serving as a surrogate marker for the increased morbidity seen with malnutrition, inflammation, and atherosclerosis syndrome. A large, prospective study is required to further elucidate the association between PrCl and inflammatory or nutritional status in PD patients. Further investigations focusing on the description of changes in PrCl with time on treatment and the associated prognostic significance are also warranted.']"

Therefore, there is an urgency for strategic interventions aimed at improving child nutrition in the most vulnerable countries (Burundi, Malawi, Comoros, Ethiopia, Niger, Mali, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone, Namibia, Chad and Congo DR) and sub-regions (East Africa and West Africa) in SSA if the internationally agreed WHO global nutrition targets regarding stunting, wasting and underweight among children under 5 years of age are to be achieved by 2025.']"
2018-02-06T00:00:00Z,Effect of maternal height on caesarean section and neonatal mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa: An analysis of 34 national datasets,"['Our study findings show that short stature is associated with adverse reproductive outcomes. Short maternal stature leads to more caesarean sections, and shorter women experience higher levels of neonatal loss. While caesarean sections can be lifesaving operations, they cost the health system and families more, and are associated with worse health outcomes.The problems of short stature can be potentially mitigated by better intrapartum care, but are best addressed through nutrition and infection prevention outside the childbirth period. Our findings contribute to highlighting the importance of implementing policies and programmes promoting good health and nutrition of young girls and women throughout the life course. Adult height is primarily established by averting stunting during the first two years of a child’s life, i.e. the critical first 1000 days [4], but recent research has shown that some catch-up growth might occur in adolescence and early adulthood[26]. Policies should target improved infant nutrition and reduced infections in infancy, with the aim of increasing girls’ adult height and thus reducing future adverse birth outcomes, and targeting healthy diets for older children, adolescents and young adults to promote potential catch-up growth. About a fifth of stunting could be reduced in high burden countries with an annual investment of $9.6 billion to scale up ten evidence-based nutrition interventions [44], although all available interventions for nutrition and disease prevention are estimated to be able to avert only about a third of stunting in total in the 1000-day window [45]. Additional evidence suggests that addressing the intergenerational effects of undernutrition [45–47] are essential to reducing stunting, and underscores the importance of a life course approach to targeting high impact nutrition interventions on children, girls, and in pregnancy. Making gains in the adult height of females is also important since short maternal stature is associated with small-for-gestational-age births, which has in turn been linked to increased risk of neonatal and infant mortality, as well as long-term health consequences such as neurocognitive impairment and adult chronic disease [40, 48–51]. Policies targeting stunting in infant girls, that aim to increase their adult height and thus decrease their subsequent risk of experiencing caesarean section, adverse birth outcomes, and other aspects of poor child and adult health should be strongly supported.']"

These associations demonstrate that APMT and handgrip strength can be used with criterion in patients with cancer and can complement the evaluation of nutritional status and the need for nutritional intervention.However, new studies must be carried out with this population to define specific cutoff points for adults and older adults, as well as longitudinal studies to indicate causal relationships and the changes in measures of APMT and handgrip strength that occur during the hospital stay.']"

Adult p53 mutant animals have smaller wings than wild-type, but normal brain size. Furthermore, p53 does not control energy consumption during larval nutrient restriction as it has been shown in adult flies subjected to a similar nutritional stress. Hence, p53 is dispensable for brain growth during nutritional stress. Thus, we conclude that during larval development p53 regulates growth but not the resistance to nutrient restriction in Drosophila.']"

Evidence from Odisha’s Mamata scheme,"['This paper provides the first quantitative estimates of the impact of the Mamata maternity benefit scheme on exposure to nutrition interventions and household food security in Odisha. We show that the scheme had positive and significant effects on food security, registration of the pregnancy and receipt of ANC and of IFA tablets from government frontline health workers. However, we caution that without the presence of a strong health system, the fulfillment of conditions may not be as straightforward. Once data from the fourth round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) become available, further research can be conducted to examine the extent to which improvements in Odisha’s nutrition outcomes have been driven by participation in the Mamata scheme.India continues to contribute substantially to the global burden of maternal and child malnutrition. However, the Prime Minister’s 2017 Union budgetary announcement to scale up maternity benefits nationwide will constitute one of the largest cash transfer schemes in the world and will have the potential to influence several maternal and child health and nutrition indicators. Therefore, the evidence we present here on the impact of a CCT in one state in India is both timely and relevant.']"

Many health promotion strategies nowadays are drawing attention to the Mediterranean diet and these initiatives need a valid tool to assess the nutritional intakes of a population.The objective of this study was to adapt a 157-item semi-quantitative FFQ already developed and validated on a population of Lebanese pregnant women, to assess its validity and reproducibility among the general adult Lebanese population [14]. The FFQ validated in this study showed good reproducibility and relative validity compared to three 24h DRs in a heterogeneous sample of adults living in a Mediterranean country.In conclusion, we offer a valid FFQ that could be helpful in estimating food groups and nutrient intakes and useful for the investigation of dietary risk factors and Non Communicable Diseases. This FFQ is also suitable for clinical trials including nutritional interventions promoting the Mediterranean diet. Future works could focus on developing and validating a computerized version of this FFQ in order to limit its administration time.']"

The nutritional status of children under five years is determined by socioeconomic, cultural, household, maternal, and child level factors. The effect of socioeconomic factors on underweight, wasting and stunting is exhibited independently and mediated through maternal and child level factors.It is logical to conclude that empowering women as well as improving the socioeconomic status of households may contribute significantly to reducing morbidity and mortality from undernutrition. We recommend that nutritional interventions to fight childhood undernutrition should take into consideration policies or strategies that would empower women, and address socioeconomic inequalities at the community level.']"
2019-02-27T00:00:00Z,"Undernutrition among tribal children in Palghar district, Maharashtra, India","['The present study confirms that despite several nutrition programmes, the extent of undernutrition has remained extremely high in the children living in predominantly tribal rural areas of Palghar district, Maharashtra. One of the possible reasons for having persistently high level of undernutrition among tribal children is the decline in the budgetary allocation on ICDS in recent years [20]. Our analysis of the state’s budget also reveals that the nutrition expenditure as a percentage of the state budget has drastically declined from 1.68% in 2012–13 to 0.94% in 2018–19 (S1 Fig). Moreover, Singh and Sethi [22] showed that tribal sub plan funds have been underutilised by Maharashtra, particularly in two sectors (rural development and nutrition). As the main underlying cause of undernutrition among the tribal children is the poor socioeconomic conditions of the tribal population, there is a need for a multi-pronged strategy for redressing this problem.Aside from increasing the budgetary allocation for nutrition specific interventions such as APJ Abdul Kalam Amrut Aahar Yojana and ICDS, the state needs to ensure appropriate usage of funds. In addition, there is an urgent need to tighten the implementation mechanism of the Public Distribution System (PDS) in the tribal areas of Palghar. The department of Civil Supplies (food security) must ensure that tribal families are not deprived of the ration that they are entitled to because of issues like non-possession of card. Besides that, Maharashtra should seriously consider providing other nutritious food items through PDS in the tribal areas so that the nutritional needs of the tribal children and adults are met, and the problem of micronutrient deficiencies is effectively addressed.Aside from improving socioeconomic conditions of the tribal population, there is a need to improve the child care and feeding practices. The positive breast-feeding practices related to exclusive breastfeeding during the first half of infancy and continued breastfeeding through the second year of life and beyond encountered in the population should be strongly promoted. Practices that require attention are the delay in introduction of complementary foods and the low dietary diversity. This should be addressed by providing education about child care and feeding practices to the women from the time they become pregnant.']"

We also report moderate to high levels of maternal undernutrition. Gender, as well as socioeconomic and demographic factors, such as empowerment imbalance, control of farm produce, physiological density, household size and dietary habits during pregnancy, showed significant associations, or trends, with maternal and child undernutrition in bivariate and multiple variable analysis. We were also concerned with the poor dietary habits, including existing food taboos, of the women during pregnancy. Our findings stress the need for health program implementers to provide nutrition education before, during and after pregnancy, as the health of mothers is critical to the health of both the mother and fetus. Overall, this cross-sectional study provides important information to nutrition/health service providers in rural communities in evaluating and strengthening existing health programs targeting women and children, and in the development of new programs. Attention should be focussed on women’s education, access and control of resources, as well as better reproductive health services, to improve women’s balance of power in the household and ensure optimum family size for better nutrition.']"
2019-08-09T00:00:00Z,"Trends, prevalence and determinants of childhood chronic undernutrition in regional divisions of Bangladesh: Evidence from demographic health surveys, 2011 and 2014","['Bangladesh has addressed decline in stunting levels in the past. Further decline in stunting is possible through region-specific multipronged interventions, targeting children at risk [39–42]. Dhaka has made laudable improvement in child nutrition and immensely contributed to the reduction of the overall levels of stunting in Bangladesh. However, unlike Dhaka, no other regional division of Bangladesh has been able to reduce stunting significantly in the recent past (2011–2014). To attain the targeted SDG goal of reducing stunting by 2030, series of actions are necessary [43–44]. Sylhet and Barisal require strong push to improve nutritional status of children belonging to Muslim and economically poor households to break the cycle of malnutrition. Besides socio-economic progress, substantial improvement of mother’s health and better involvement of men in formal and nutritional education may help tackling stunting in these two critical divines of Bangladesh. Reduction of stunting in Sylhet also requires attention across population groups, besides economic and health improvement.Overall, to address stunting, Bangladesh needs to focus on household wealth generation, improvement of maternal health, interventions on vulnerable groups including the children from poorest socio-economic strata or children in the urban areas and strengthening the role of father to improve their knowledge in varying aspects like family planning, reduction of fertility, child nutrition and maternal care. Further, a targeted multi-sectoral programme is essential to reduce the prevalence of short heighted girls at an early age, to progress knowledge on complementary food for young children and to reinforce family planning program, aiming to increase the age at birth and to decrease higher order births, in order to achieve the SDGs by 2030.']"

Although based on the nutrient composition of single foods, the NBC was specifically developed to take this a stage further–to be able to assess the overall nutritional quality of meals composed of multiple food items as well as that of total diets.The three distinctive features of the method are novel metrics that:\n\nNumerically describe the content of qualifying and disqualifying nutrients of individual foods in a way that is independent of portion size and which, importantly, acts as a solid basis for developing various algorithms\nAllow the same analytical approach to be used across the entire food spectrum–from simple food components to complex meals and total diets, and\nProvide an original way to judge nutrient complementarity and the overall nutrient quality of meals and diets composed of multiple food items.\nThe application of the NBC algorithm to the online MyPlate 7-Day Sample Menus provides the first objective evaluating of this important nutrition communication plan. The results showed that the overall nutrition quality of the meals developed by the USDA was very high in variety, total nutrient content and relative quantities of individual nutrients (see Figs 3, 4 and A-E in S1 File; Table 4). The nutrition quality of day-to-day food patterns was also very high and remarkably constant over 7 days. The NBC calculations did, nevertheless, show some variation in the values of QI, DI and NB across meals, depending on the specific foods used.Finally, the NBC algorithm, which is relatively simple to create for particular applications and for different computer systems, could become a useful tool for devising diets or fine tuning meal planning, especially those for populations on a strict budget or with special cultural or clinical needs.']"

In the present study, a number of improvements to the eNutri personalised nutrition application’s diet advice were suggested by nutrition professionals including: greater participant profiling (e.g. weight and lifestyle), links to recipes and sources of further information, consideration of additional foods/nutrients of public health relevance (e.g. vitamin D), and more positive message framing/scoring. Future research will assess the efficacy of the system at improving user’s adherence to healthy eating guidance.\nLimitations\nThe eNutri app relies on data from a FFQ, which has some limitations. Identification of specific foods consumed is more limited compared with other methods, such as diet diaries, which may reduce its ability to identify changes in consumption of some foods. In addition, FFQs are not necessarily the nutrition assessment method that NP would utilise during nutrition consultations; 24-hour recall and food diaries are most frequently selected. This study is subjective and qualitative in nature making it more difficult to apply comparative statistics. Furthermore, the food intake on which the eNutri personalised advice was based was translated to food group equivalents by the app, however this information was not provided to the NP. In some cases, this could have contributed to the different dietary targets identified by the eNutri app and the NP. The number of female NP was much higher than male NP, which may be considered as a potential limitation. However this is reflective of the gender distribution of these professions; in the present study 16% of RNutr identified were male and in a recent international survey of RD, 4% of UK respondants were male [2].\n']"

Dietary shifts aggravated by climate-related declines in seafood consumption may have significant nutritional and health implications for BC FNs. It is important to note that the traditional diet of coastal BC FNs has already been declining as a result of social and environmental changes and has led to the inadequate intakes of important nutrients. For example, from the Fraser River to northern BC, eulachon which was formerly a staple for coastal communities, and is known to be an excellent source of vitamin A, has almost disappeared. Similarly, bivalves, an excellent source of protein and iron, has diminished substantively. These major changes account for some of the limited changes in iron and vitamin A seen from the climate change modelling. Therefore, strategies to improve seafood harvest potential and access rights to coastal communities are needed to ensure the nutritional health and overall well-being, and to promote food security and food sovereignty in coastal FNs. In particular, more rigorous adaptations scenarios and a transformation in fisheries governance, involving participatory methodologies to incorporating Indigenous knowledge, livelihood objectives and perspectives, are needed to address the nutritional burden facing FN’s diets.']"

The accuracy of PIXE/RBS for measuring Mn was assessed by the analysis of a National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Material®, 1849a Infant/Adult Nutritional Formula; the relative error for the measurements of Mn was -0.22%. All 44 of the samples we analyzed had measurable concentrations of Mn.In general, products with supplemental Mn had higher Mn concentrations than products without supplemental Mn (Fig 1 and Table 3). For products without supplemental Mn, products with chocolate had the most Mn, followed by soy, rice, and cow milk, all of which had more Mn than reported concentrations in breast milk (Fig 1 and Table 3).The ranges of concentrations of Mn in the infant formulas and young child nutritional beverage products greatly exceeded the ranges of Mn concentrations reported in breast milk. The ranges of Mn concentrations in the 17 infant and follow-on formula products purchased in France were in compliance with French, European, and international standards. The ranges of Mn concentrations in the 25 infant formula and young child nutritional beverages purchased in the US satisfied the US minimum standards for infant formula. While 2 of the 16 US infant formula products and 5 of the 8 products labeled for children over 12 months that we tested exceeded the CAC international Guidance Upper Level (GUL) of 100 Mn/100 kcal for infant formulas, US laws do not currently stipulate a maximum Mn content for infant formulas or regulate Mn content in formulas or powders for children over 12 months old and the CAC does not stipulate a GUL for Mn for formula products for children over 12 months old 89].Given the recent research demonstrating adverse effects of excess Mn exposure for neurodevelopment [4–7,10–47], stricter upper limits for Mn content in infant formulas should be considered by regulators. The 38-year-old requirement for minimum Mn content in infant formulas in the US [1] may need to be updated to make it closer to the Mn content in breast milk, and a maximum Mn content for infant formulas and young child nutritional beverage products may be appropriate for the US market.In the meantime, it must be noted that supplementation of infant formulas and young child nutritional beverage products with Mn is unnecessary to meet the current health-based regulatory minimum of 1 μg Mn/100 kcal stipulated by the CAC, EU and Republic of France, or the US minimum of 5 μg Mn/100 kcal [1–3,9,90]. There is no proven or likely benefit from Mn supplementation in these products and some researchers contend there is potential for adverse neurodevelopmental health effects in infants and young children. Pending research on dietary Mn exposures that examine health effects at high and low Mn dietary intakes in neonates, infants, and young children, formula manufacturers may consider taking measures to reduce Mn content in their products to approach the Mn concentrations found in breast milk rather than supplement their products with additional Mn when the products already have much higher Mn concentrations than breast milk.']"

While infectious disease outbreaks require urgent action for appropriate response, it is important to not underestimate the time and efforts required for gaining acceptance, buy-in, and involvement of the local community. Especially in the context of nutrition, where cases of severe malnutrition will likely be exacerbated and dietary practices are steeped in longstanding cultural traditions, behavior change can be slower than desired in the context of an emergency.

Socioeconomic factors, maternal nutritional status, and child size at birth were associated with LAZ and BAZ at 10–15 months of age. The occurrence of malaria within the first year of life was significantly related to worse LAZ. Focusing on an early stage of childhood, the present study emphasized the importance of directing actions to reduce inequalities and improve health conditions when facing a double burden of malnutrition, taking advantage of a window of opportunity that may redirect child growth trajectories toward better short- and long-term health and nutrition outcomes.']"

The ICER of US$24 for switching from invitation to food supplementation at the usual time in pregnancy and iron-folic acid supplementation to an early initiation of food supplementation combined with MMS can be considered affordable in a low-resource setting and viable from both a public health and economic perspective. These results can hopefully inspire others to consider multiple outcomes of nutritional interventions in economic evaluations and help to support decision-makers in the prioritizing of financing for nutrition interventions targeting pregnant women’s health.']

Children should be fed with diverse food groups including iron-rich foods according to WHO complementary feeding guidelines. Continued breastfeeding to age 2 and beyond should also be promoted. Since stunting begins in the prenatal period, nutritional promotion for pregnant mothers and early and regular ANC visits should be encouraged. While further prospective research is needed to determine the effect of feeding practices on linear growth, interventions such as iron supplementation and nutritional education programs could help prevent stunting and childhood anemia and might reduce their prevalence in Myanmar.']"

As already observed by us and other authors, this risk of systematic perturbations may describe a syndrome due to incomplete feeding after the placenta nutrient flow disruption, the PI-ReFeeding syndrome. The effort to improve nutrition of premature infants has led many of us to focus primarily on the amount of AA and energy intake, thus in part underestimating the fundamental role of phosphorus and potassium for growth.

The adult medflies emerged from pupae whose larvae were reared on a fatty acid deficient liquid diet looked normal, but could not fly, whereas the control flies emerged from pupae whose larvae were reared on the standard mill feed diet looked normal and had normal flight ability. The two groups of larvae showed large differential differences of protein profiles. In comparison, fli-I, LRR-containing G protein-coupled receptor 2, LRR protein soc-2 and protein wings apart-like were over-expressed in pupae from larvae fed with the fatty acid deficient liquid diet. The results signify that nutritional deficiency induces fli-I over-expression in medfly. Fli-I over-expression may depress the Wnt signaling, as indicated by under-expression of several Wnt pathway proteins, and thus cause flightlessness. As the fli-I gene is highly conserved across life forms from insects to humans and SMS is due to an abnormality in the short (p) arm of chromosome 17 where fli-I gene is located, we would postulate that nutritional deficiency might be associated with human SMS.']"

The intervention was designed following well-established Health Belief Model. The intervention was not able to motivate a change in student consumption behavior. Our study tests the introduction of classroom nutrition education as a school nutrition policy advocated by different stakeholders. Our findings have implications for school-based interventions that aim to promote healthy eating habits. Our study shows that students are not motivated to take healthy foods on their plates and are on average wasting 76% of the food on their plates. With increasing rate of childhood obesity and diabetes, it is important to test and develop strategies that target school environmental factors that promote healthy dietary habits.Elementary school students are in an age of forming life-long habits. Policy makers and school officials need to work together to create an environment that would promote and foster healthy eating habits. This needs systematic approach in the form of long-term, multicomponent nutrition education programs. These programs should encompass hands-on activities, interesting to elementary school students, for raising awareness about benefits of consuming fruits and vegetables both at school and at home. Failure to create such stimulating environments may lead to less healthy youth in the forthcoming years and inefficiencies in resource utilization.']"

In addition, our results indicated that the intention to consume and to purchase enriched bread can be maintained with levels < 12.17% and < 6.86% tilapia-waste flour, respectively. Finally, the results suggest that bread fortified with tilapia-waste flour at 5% (wheat flour replacement by 10% of TF) can be a potential alternative for the food industry to satisfy the current nutritional and sustainability requirements of consumers.']"

The results from the PeNSE 2009 also indicate the presence of socioeconomic inequalities in the occurrence of DBM and the remaining studied outcomes. Undoubtedly, the social determinants of health have a strong influence on the opportunities and the ways Brazilians eat and on the risks related to the nutritional status of individuals and communities, which indicates a need for answers beyond the health sector.

The dairy products modulated some common pathways during the postprandial phase, notably including various inflammatory or immune genes. The whole blood transcriptome appeared to be a sensitive surrogate marker of metabolic processes that showed coherence with established clinical biomarkers but also revealed subtle differences in the responses to the dairy products that were not captured by these biomarkers. The development of nutrition-specific genesets as well as the combined assessment of metabolomic with transcriptomic data could help better exploit this tool in the context of nutritional interventions. This approach nevertheless remains a promising method to complement classical biomarkers and metabolome evaluation to help better discriminate the metabolic responses to dietary intake in a healthy population.']"

The flux of nutrients in rainfall in the wet winter months combined with inputs of HP, especially during the drier summers, suggests that atmospheric nutrient deposition may play a potentially important, year-around, role in plant nutrition at these sites. The depositional nutrient load and the ability of the vegetation to intercept and take up foliar deposition may explain why this vegetation is distinct floristically from neighboring Fynbos vegetation that occurs on less nutrient rich soils [79]. Although the relative lack of fire in Strandveld may also be important in determining vegetation structure, floristic characteristics and nutrition, we suggest that the name of this vegetation, meaning “beach vegetation” in Afrikaans, adequately describes the reason for the existence of this particular vegetation.']"

Technical inputs that build community capacity are necessary but not sufficient. In order for VHSNCs to be sustainable mechanisms for community participation in health, they need to operate within more supportive contexts that go beyond the technical inputs.

Our study supports our previous work with starved fire ant queens in that the sNPFR signaling may change in response to nutritional requirements, not only in queens but workers. To our knowledge this is the first if not one of the few studies with social insects that correlate body size, behavioral state and colony brood presence (proxy for colony nutritional status/requirements) with the actual protein expression of a brain neuropeptide receptor, sNPFR, and not a transcript. In the absence of brood, the overall decrease in the sNPFR signal observed in worker brains supports the idea that workers may be less motivated to search for food. It is apparent that in fire ant workers, similar to bees, changes in sNPFR expression depend at least partially on foraging needs.']"
2018-07-16T00:00:00Z,Impact of maternal nutritional supplementation in conjunction with a breastfeeding support program during the last trimester to 12 weeks postpartum on breastfeeding practices and child development at 30 months old,"['In summary, maternal milk supplementation from the last trimester to the first 12 weeks postpartum, coupled with a breastfeeding support program was significantly associated with prolonged EBF duration, increased EBF rate at 6 months, and reduced risk of early EBF cessation. The intervention also significantly improved child neurodevelopment in the domains of cognitive and motor functions at 30 months of age, when compared with the current standard care. The benefits of the maternal intervention on child neurodevelopment were partially mediated by higher birth weight but not EBF duration. This suggests that the prenatal nutritional supplementation may have played a more important role than the additional breastfeeding support given during the postnatal period in promoting neurodevelopment of the offspring. Future studies with a larger sample size are needed to examine the longer-term impacts of maternal nutritional supplementation on child growth and development.']"

It is also the first to assess the effect of these pregnancy interventions on child nutritional status after birth and the first to assess impact of cash transfer using an RCT design. We confirm others’ findings that provision of food, a fortified balanced energy protein supplement in our case, in pregnancy can increase birthweight, but evidence for the impact of cash transfers (7.5 USD/mo) is less clear. PLA alone did not increase birthweight substantially and did not attain significance.Provision of nutritious food supplements to pregnant women can increase the weight of babies at birth and may be more effective than provision of a modest amount of cash to buy additional food in pregnancy. However, in environments with very poor sanitation and hygiene, where infant and young child feeding behaviours are inadequate, gains in weight resulting from pregnancy interventions are not sustained, which suggests that nutrition interventions in pregnancy may need to continue beyond pregnancy until at least 2 years of age. Further studies comparing the effects of food and cash and assessing the impact of PLA on birthweight and child nutrition are needed, as are studies evaluating the long-term impacts on health of increases in birthweight.']"
2016-01-25T00:00:00Z,Global Expanded Nutrient Supply (GENuS) Model: A New Method for Estimating the Global Dietary Supply of Nutrients,"['The GENuS model provides a new and detailed method to estimate supplies of key micro- and macronutrients globally, based on 225 food commodities within 152 countries over the past 50 years. This model also allows better estimation of heterogeneity in global nutrition by analyzing nutrient supplies across 34 age and sex groups. Because this method calculates nutrient supplies down to the individual food group, it is a more powerful tool for calculating how changes in access to particular foods or changes of nutrient composition of those foods would potentially impact intake of specific nutrients for target populations and the overall adequacy of their nutrition. This not only allows researchers or policymakers to find those most vulnerable for nutrient deficiency or malnutrition, but also to know which foods supply those nutrients, and which countries would be vulnerable to changes in production or access to these foods. For example, GENuS can allow, for the first time, robust estimation of the nutrient supply consequences of varying threats to different foods due to climate change, soil degradation, drought, loss of pollinators, and other modern challenges. By using food supply data over the past half-century, we have the unique ability to attain nearly global coverage to measure worldwide trends. Because of its scope and detail, the GENuS model can provide a useful and versatile method for monitoring global nutrition and health in a rapidly changing world.']"

The literature readily acknowledges the contribution that the SF trade has on the economy but fails to explore how one could go about improving the trade and growing the vendors’ knowledge and skills. This research study thus embarked on developing a SFVM that would entail nutrition, hygiene and safety, and business and operational aspects of street-food vending.

Women’s tolerance to domestic violence in Odisha was a concern and needs to be addressed through NRLM or other social welfare platforms. Along with increasing SHG membership, need for improving reach of food security schemes or nutri-sensitive livelihoods is needed across all states. The gains in women’s financial control are yet to translate in improving their nutritional status across all states. SHG membership has varying influence in use of antenatal, partum and family planning services across Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. Services that require increased attention across all states include pregnancy registration in first trimester, height measurement of pregnant women, increased information and access to family planning methods and participation in VHSNDs. In Bihar, reach of all ANC services excluding TT vaccination need to be reviewed. The need for layering essential women’s nutrition interventions that is access to health services and care to nutritionally “at risk”, access to family planning services, improving dietary diversity, preventing micronutrient deficiencies and anemia and access to water, sanitation and hygiene services is immense. The context supports an inititaivet like Swabhimaan to layer these nutrition interventions on the NRLM platforms.

Then, SVFS was used to select the optimal characteristics set for the identification of NPK deficiencies, and Fisher discriminant analysis was used to build the diagnosis model.Compared with traditional methods, hierarchical identification can be used to effectively build the targeted identification rules for each nutrition deficiency. Finally, to improve the accuracy of the identification, this research introduced hierarchical identification. In this research, the identification process was divided into three hierarchies. First, the normal and non-normal (NPK deficiencies) samples were identified. In this hierarchy the selected characteristics were LSR, LSG, LSB, LSL, LTR, LTG, LA and LG. In the second hierarchy, N deficiency and PK deficiencies were identified. In this hierarchy the selected characteristics were LSG, LSB, WRA, LB, and LG. Finally, P deficiency and K deficiency were identified. In this hierarchy the selected characteristics were LG, LSL, A/L, LTG, L23, LSG, and LI.The result showed that hierarchical identification can be used to effectively improve the accuracy of identification (86.15, 87.69, 90.00 and 89.23% for the 4 growth stages). Data representing different years were used for validation, and the validation accuracies were 83.08, 83.08, 89.23 and 90.77% for the 4 growth stages.The study provides evidence for the quick diagnosis of rice nutrient status, which makes it possible to accurately identify rice NPK deficiencies with scanning technology. Other crops, such as maize and wheat, suffering nutrition deficiencies usually exhibit some special symptoms on the leaves and sheaths, and this method can be used to diagnose their nutrition level status. Therefore, the technology introduced in the study has application value and development potential.']"

Moreover, a greater species diversity in the forage mixture reduced invasibility by unsown species. However, these advantages depend on the cutting or grazing strategy since all forbs and legumes were reduced by continuous grazing. Our results reveal the importance of balancing dominant and non-dominant species to achieve higher yields without compromising the nutritive value.

This study is the first to report on how Fe biofortification, a clinically-validated method for increasing Fe status, impacts the composition and metagenome of the gut microbiota. Animals (Gallus gallus) who consumed the Fe biofortified bean-based diet had less abundance of pathogenic bacteria, with concomitant increases in bacteria that produce short chain fatty acids and have known phenolic catabolic capacity. Collectively, these findings provide evidence that, unlike other nutritional methods of increasing Fe status, Fe biofortification does not appear to increase the pathogenic load in the gut, and they raise the possibility that this strategy can further improve in efficacy and safety as the role of the gut microbiota is explored in additional experimental settings.']"
2015-05-15T00:00:00Z,Intake of Erythrocytes Required for Reproductive Development of Female Schistosoma japonicum,"['Besides pairing with male, the reproductive development of female S. japonicum requires nutritional support. Our findings confirmed it is possible to culture immature pre-adult worms to egg producing worms in the presence of either red blood cells or hemaglobin hydrolysate or lactalbumin hydrolysate. The bovine hemoglobin hydrolysate promoted female sexual maturation instead of intact hemoglobin, suggesting that free amino acid and dipeptides were more efficient for stimulating the reproductive development than complete proteins in culture medium. In addition, RBCs significantly promoted the expression of reproduction-related genes in paired female worms cultured in vitro. Yet, the in vitro developed female schistosomes were not fully matured, for their eggs were still infertile. Understanding the nutritional requirements for schistosome reproductive development can be expected to aid optimization of in vitro culture methods for these parasites, and provide insights for innovative ways for treatment of schistosomiasis.']"

2015-04-08T00:00:00Z,Low Birth Weight at Term and Its Determinants in a Tertiary Hospital of Nepal: A Case-Control Study,"['History of premature delivery, hard physical work during pregnancy, younger age at pregnancy, mother’s lower haemoglobin level and lack of nutritious diet consumption during pregnancy were the major determinants of low birth weight among term babies in Nepal. Public health programs should focus on raising awareness on avoiding early marriage and pregnancy of females. Moreover, it should provide emphasis on adequate rest and nutrition during pregnancy in order to decrease the prevalence of low birth weight. Provision of a more intensive ANC to mothers with a history of premature deliveries can be another important strategy to prevent low birth weight babies. The role of family members is important especially in fulfilling the nutritional and health care needs of the pregnant mothers along with supporting her to take adequate rest in the cultural context of Nepal.']"
2018-07-10T00:00:00Z,Grain zinc concentrations differ among Brazilian wheat genotypes and respond to zinc and nitrogen supply,"['A greater N supply promoted better Zn uptake, translocation of Zn to the shoot and accumulation of Zn in the grain of wheat plants. Thus, management of N nutritional status is a promising route for the biofortification of wheat grain with Zn. Although this study was conducted under controlled conditions, field experiments have been conducted demonstrating the same synergistic effect of N on Zn uptake and accumulation in cereals grains, supporting the hypothesis that effective Zn biofortification of wheat grain is provided by the judicious application of both N and Zn fertilizer. The genotypes analyzed in the experiment reported here showed large contrasts in their partitioning of biomass and Zn between plant parts. Since there was no negative relationship between grain yield and grain Zn concentration or content, it might be possible combine the greater grain yield of the Quartzo genotype with the better Zn partitioning in the BRS Parrudo genotype to deliver a greatly improved genotype. This would be a significant advance for the biofortification of wheat for human nutrition.']"

2018-02-08T00:00:00Z,Towards a novel model for studying the nutritional stage dynamics of the Colombian population by age and socioeconomic status,"['To the best of our knowledge this study constitutes the first assessment of the SES-related obesity dynamics in a LMIC using a complex systems approach. We proposed a heuristic to estimate the TRs and a population-level SD model to assess and model the nutritional stage dynamics of an urban population by age and SES, over time. The TR indicators were constructed, and this study constitutes the first use of these indicators to provide information regarding the fraction of individuals who move between BMI categories stratified by age and SES.The model results, which have implications for the targeting of interventions in Colombia, indicate that the most vulnerable and poorest groups display higher TRs to overweight and obese, whereas wealthiest groups show the highest prevalences of overweight and obesity. Despite this, the main public health policies in Colombia targeting the lowest SES population are related to undernutrition and integrated policies for the whole spectrum of malnutrition are not effectively implemented. We also found that the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children aged 0 to 14 years do not follow the patterns observed in other middle income countries in Latin America.The model proposed in this paper offers policymakers a useful tool to better monitor nutritional transitions among diverse segments of the population. In particular, the model could be employed to estimate the TRs between BMI categories by age and SES, and to help identify which subgroups of the population should be targeted. The model could also be used to monitor the impact of health interventions implemented to prevent the development of overweight and obesity related to age and SES. Finally, with proper adaptations this model could be used for assessing SES-related nutritional transitions in other LMICs.']"

Since the greater is the variability for an individual trait, the greater the opportunity for genetic improvement by plant breeders, the next phase of the research will focus on creating new germplasm with increased nutritional quality. Potential parents for use in breeding programs can be chosen from the surveyed material among the inbred lines with seeds containing the least amount of C-GFs.In addition, last but not least, we also produced molecular data regarding phytic acid pathway and showed which genes are more relevant for phytic acid biosynthesis in the seeds. These results together with a preliminary analysis of pearl millet orthologous genes for C-glycosylflavones biosynthesis open the way to dissect the genetic determinants controlling key seed nutritional phenotypes and to the characterization of their impact on grain nutritional value in pearl millet.']"
2015-08-19T00:00:00Z,Metabolomic and Lipidomic Analysis of Serum Samples following Curcuma longa Extract Supplementation in High-Fructose and Saturated Fat Fed Rats,"['A view of the metabolic changes in an animal model fed with high fructose and saturated fatty acid diet, as long as the effects of integration with the nutritional supplement Curcuma longa has been provided by NMR metabolomics and GC-MS lipidomics of the serum. While the observed and expected, diet-induced, metabolic disorders (insulin resistance) could not be countered by the nutritional supplement, elements have been discerned of a possible localized protection, notably at the liver level. Indeed, while perturbation of several energy-related metabolites (amino acids, ketonic bodies, creatine, pyruvate, glucose, VLDL) have been observed in both animals fed with the high fructose and saturated fatty acid diets, despite Curcuma longa dietary supplementation, specific biomarkers could be associated to this latter setup. Particularly, a depression of the alcohol oxidation, detected through an enhanced concentration of methanol, and a possible activation of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, consistent with a reduction of glutamine and glycoprotein levels. Both these two effects point towards a modified liver function. Further biomarkers of the curcuminoid enriched diet were a significant alteration of the concentration of long chain unsaturated fatty acids: C20:5n-3, C22:6n-3 and C24:1n-9. The variation in the concentration in this latter is a specific effect of the nutritional supplement, as it is not observed in the high fructose and saturated fatty acid diet groups, and is suggestive of a cellular enhanced response to the membrane rigidification associated to insulin resistance. All of these points to possible specific and local, rather than systemic, protective effects of Curcuma longa, and further studies are underway to clarify this issue.']"
2015-11-04T00:00:00Z,"Interactive Effects of Indigestible Carbohydrates, Protein Type, and Protein Level on Biomarkers of Large Intestine Health in Rats","['The results of the present study were not always consistent with previous reports, and the effects of experimental factors on parameters related to gut health are inconclusive. However, cecal parameters showed more intense fermentation of pectin and potato protein, than cellulose and casein, respectively. Higher dietary protein levels also exhibited a stimulatory effect on cecal parameters. Concentrations of SCFA were affected by interactions among experimental variables, suggestive of the modifying effects of nutritional factors on the fermentation process and possibly, on bacterial populations in the gut. Different types of protein affected the concentration of metabolites in large intestinal compartments differently. Feeding potato protein reduced phenol concentrations in the cecal digesta, but increased both the cecal pool of p-cresol, and the concentration of ammonia in the colon. Our observations on colonocyte DNA damage may suggest the beneficial influence of a protein level of 20% in the diet of rats. Moreover, experimental factors influenced large intestine health by its effects on cecal digesta weight, which directly or indirectly determines the production of fermentation end-products, morphological parameters, and DNA status in colonocytes. Nutritional factors increasing the cecal digesta weight contribute to smaller concentrations of phenol (potato protein) and less DNA damage (higher protein level), but may be undesirable because of increased levels of ammonia in the colon (potato protein and pectin). Owing to the differences in the action of experimental factors on particular indices, our results obtained using the rat model require further evaluation, and remain to be confirmed in human studies before the translations in nutritional recommendations to improve the health status of the large intestine.']"
2015-06-15T00:00:00Z,Identification of Relevant Phytochemical Constituents for Characterization and Authentication of Tomatoes by General Linear Model Linked to Automatic Interaction Detection (GLM-AID) and Artificial Neural Network Models (ANNs),"['Both methods developed, GLM-AID and ANN, have selected different nutritional parameters. The AID analysis does not provide a function that measures the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable. However, the AID analysis can be used with other statistical techniques to complete the analysis and determine the relative importance of the different independent variables. In comparison, the ANN creates a function and certain relationships among variables that are more affective in the approximation to each output variable allowing a prediction, more or less accurate, for each output studied variable.GLM-AID has identified the most significant chemical parameters linked to the harvest date and the production system, and even associated to same tomato cultivars, which can be considered as the main significant differences among tomato samples.GLM-AID showed that weather conditions have the main influence on the chemical composition of tomatoes followed by the effect of the production system. Once identified those chemical parameters, the tomato cultivars were not sequentially segmented. It can be due to a similar nutritional composition of the tomatoes cultivars.The ANN models showed different results, where the percentage of classification according to harvest date was 100%, slightly reduced for the production system with 93.8%, and finally the lowest percentage, 50%, for the tomato cultivar. One possible explanation is that the nutritional parameters are not suitable for the identification or classification of tomato cultivars so other kind of markers should be considered. Nevertheless, the combination of GLM-AID and ANN models can be useful to reduce experimental time and cost, personal costs, allowing the use of this predictive models in food fraud detection.']"

Failure to meet these three ROB domain criteria greatly increased the likelihood of a neutral or negative quality rating.Over time, the percentage of published research that meets the ROB domain criteria (lower risk of bias) has steadily increased with the exception of Performance, which only began improvement in 2000. There were a few instances in which non-government-only funding was a significant predictor of whether there was a higher risk of bias for Selection when compared to government funding and there were also a few instances where non-government-only funding predicted less risk of bias for Detection and Attrition. However, research design and publication year were more consistent predictors of ROB domain ratings in food and nutrition research.There was surprisingly little overlap (10%) and very high consistency in the ROB domain ratings for the research articles with more than one critical appraisal record. The largest overlap was between the EAL and NEL, where there was extremely high agreement in the ROB domain ratings.These results support focusing on the three ROB domains that can be strengthened, and they allow the food and nutrition research community to focus on constructive ways to improve the overall body of research rather than investigate source of funding as the primary predictor of ROB. This research sets the stage for establishing initiatives to support or create research environments that enhance rigor of research and demand research integrity.']"

Lipids more abundant in milk replacer appeared to be driving the association in the current study. These findings demonstrated that lipid composition of neonatal diet affects tissue composition and thus may affect development, function and overall health and fertility.

However, weight gain does not necessarily indicate improved nutritional status. Hand-grip strength, lean body mass and the BIA Illness Marker appear promising indicators of nutritional state as they were more sensitive to change over time and they reflect functional change.The research indicated a beneficial effect of e’Pap for both study populations, and particularly for adult TB patients, whose baseline data reflected severe food insecurity and malnutrition in a majority of cases.Poor food security and dietary diversity undermine health and are likely to undermine conventional TB treatment and early childhood development. The improvement in serum micronutrient levels over the short time period of this study suggest that fortified supplementary foods, such as e’Pap, with bio-available micronutrients could be of great benefit, particularly if incorporated into health interventions in resource poor settings.Though suggestive, this study’s limitations prevent firm conclusions. Wider investigation with a larger sample size, increased duration of intervention and longer term follow-up to ascertain the sustainability of the positive outcomes is recommended. A detailed and more resource-intensive follow up study could inform public health interventions aimed at addressing micro-nutrient deficiency and improving the efficacy of conventional treatment protocols.""]"
2019-06-12T00:00:00Z,Determining factors for the prevalence of anemia in women of reproductive age in Nepal: Evidence from recent national survey data,"['This study demonstrates the factors associated with the prevalence of anemia in Nepal. It is quite evident from the study findings that the general health status of the women of reproductive age in Nepal needs substantial improvement. This study found that about 41% of the women of reproductive age was anemic. Thus, anemia could be considered as a severe public health problem. The higher prevalence of anemia revealed in this study compared to the past survey highlights the needs to reconsider the existing nutritional policy in Nepal. The prevalence of anemia was higher among underweight women, while obese women were less likely to become anemic. Both, anemia and lower BMI are the indicators of poor nutritional status. Poor diet quality may result in the lower bioavailability of dietary iron, thus increasing the risk of developing anemia. An overall higher prevalence of anemia suggests the necessity of developing appropriate nutrition interventions; iron supplementation could be the immediate measure to cure anemia while periodic deworming, food diversification, and food fortification might be the long-term measures for the management of anemia. Given that a larger proportion of households are using well-water as the source of drinking water, appropriate measures to protect the well-water such as protecting the wells and disinfection of water before use may decrease the likelihood of parasite infestation, and in turn, reduce the prevalence of anemia. Mobilization of community health workers and volunteers can be a strategic measure to reach a large section of adolescents including women of reproductive age. Anemia surveillance and interventions programs specific to targeted groups and high-risk populations are recommended for reduction of anemia. Further research studies are advised to understand the prevalence and determinants of anemia.']"

Here, however, we found that lycosids contain no more energy or nutrients than do other potentially available arthropod prey, and hence that nutritional factors alone are unlikely to explain why S. youngsoni preys selectively on lycosids. It may be that alternative factors are more influential in shaping this selectivity. For instance, lycosids may have lower capture and handling times compared to other prey. However, as discussed previously, this is unlikely and selectivity is probably driven by factors in the environment of S. youngsoni. For example, selective depredation of lycosids may arise simply as a consequence of high encounter rates if S. youngsoni and lycosids occupy similar microhabitats and are active at similar times. By quantifying the spatial and temporal activity patterns, as well as diets of both groups of predator, the extent of resource overlap could be identified and alternative explanations for the observed pattern of selective depredation evaluated.']"

Food reformulation could play a key role in rebalancing dietary intakes if the present results were confirmed when including reformulation efforts in other food categories and in other countries. In addition, and to ensure that reformulated products do provide an overall improved nutritional profile, reformulation standards would need to consider energy content and both macro- and micronutrients. Further research needs also to account for consumer behaviors to understand how and why individuals would opt for products with improved nutrient profiles and how to guide them towards these options. Cultural backgrounds play a key role in food selection, and there is strong need to assess which population could benefit most from food reformulation, and which food categories should be prioritized.']"

Morphological traits, GCI and LA, obtained by digital analysis also had significant responses to the range of EF doses, but only LA had a positive relationship with most nutritional parameters.

2014-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Micronutrient Deficiencies and Related Factors in School-Aged Children in Ethiopia: A Cross-Sectional Study in Libo Kemkem and Fogera Districts, Amhara Regional State","['Our findings reveal a high prevalence of vitamin A deficiency and vitamin D insufficiency (29.3% and 49%, respectively) while moderate prevalence of zinc and folate deficiencies (12.5% and 13.9%, respectively) in school-aged children in Libo Kemkem and Fogera. The magnitude of anaemia determined in this study (30.9%) is considered as a moderate public health problem according to WHO standards [65]. Up to date, only few countries have conducted surveys on micronutrients status at the national or subnational level, and most of them are focused on limited number of micronutrients [47], [48], [68]. Given the paucity of previous data, our results represent a starting point for future research.To effectively tackle micronutrients deficiencies and anaemia in school-aged children, nutritional programs should be oriented to the local needs. Zinc supplementation trials have clearly demonstrated the positive benefits of improved zinc status in children, including reductions in the incidence of various infectious diseases [26], [36]. There is also enough evidence of the benefits of vitamins A and D supplementation programs in similar contexts [10], [26], [76]. Targeting anaemia is a complex challenge in developing countries, where prevalence of malnutrition and infectious diseases is high, although until date, iron supplementation and nutrition education are the only interventions that seem to be effective against IDA [26].Micronutrient-deficiency control programs have been greatly extended in most African countries [14], although most interventions have been focused on single micronutrients and often lack effectiveness [77]. Diet diversification strategies are far less common, despite of dietary diversity being universally recognized as a key component of nutrition programs [9]. Therefore, major efforts are needed to close critical knowledge gaps, to test and scale-up improved and affordable interventions, and to disseminate evidence to decision makers and stakeholders to fully respond to this key public health problem. This will help to rapidly and sustainably improve the diet diversity and the nutritional status in the study setting, which would have a positive impact on economic growth and development.Findings documented by this study would assist in planning and undertaking regional policy initiatives for diet diversification strategies to streamline recommendations. Monitoring activities should also follow these interventions to better assess their impact on micronutrients deficiencies and anaemia. This will enable the right interventions to be chosen and then, once programs are in place, to have the right indicators to follow-up these activities [11].']"
2017-11-16T00:00:00Z,The chicken or the egg? Exploring bi-directional associations between Newcastle disease vaccination and village chicken flock size in rural Tanzania,"['Animal health programs–and development programs more broadly–that involve the voluntary investment of funds by local households offer a sustainable pathway to food and nutrition security, which avoids a reliance on ongoing support from governments or donor agencies. Village chickens, ubiquitous throughout rural communities of sub-Saharan Africa, are a worthy target of efforts to alleviate poverty and enhance diet quality. Within this study, the finding of greater flock size following Newcastle disease vaccination provides assurance of the vaccine being handled and administered effectively by local vaccinators. Increased thermotolerance of the I-2 ND vaccine removes the need for a continuous cold chain, but requirements for appropriate storage, transport and ensuring opened vaccine vials are used within an appropriate time period remain important.Equally central to a successful ND control program is the awareness-raising and educational role of the vaccinator within their community. Tanzanian poultry-keepers are familiar with clinical signs and patterns of disease amongst their birds, and, although formal diagnosis is rare, illness and mortality compatible with Newcastle disease (Mdondo in Swahili) is a known entity. Despite this, when financial reserves are scarce, climate patterns unpredictable, available environmental feed resources limited and the threat of predation and theft common, poultry-keepers may be initially reluctant to invest in ND vaccination programs. This study’s finding of increased vaccination uptake by households to whom questions about chicken ownership, management and consumption were posed on a regular basis supports the idea of awareness generating demand for vaccination.As per the age-old “chicken or the egg” conundrum, linkages between vaccination and poultry flock size are confirmed to be bi-directional: vaccination leads to increased flock size, and larger flocks are more likely to be vaccinated. The real dilemma is how to encourage vaccination amongst households with fewer chickens and to support chicken-keepers to vaccinate regularly. One targeted program in Mozambique has involved the distribution of both chickens and ND vaccination vouchers to households affected by HIV/AIDS, allowing community vaccinators to collect payment for their service from two local non-governmental organisations during the first year of a newly introduced ND vaccination program [32]. Opportunities for a similar subsidised vaccination service for vulnerable households elsewhere in Africa, perhaps integrated with existing or future social welfare programs, warrants further exploration. Qualitative approaches to explore household decision-making around chicken health and management, allocation of income, and motivations, challenges and priorities of community vaccinators will be central to the identification and addressing of barriers to broader vaccination coverage.Findings which link chicken flock size with households’ socioeconomic status affirm the value of integrated approaches to poverty alleviation in efforts to enhance food and nutrition security. There is scope for greater economic and nutritional contributions of village chickens, but this may be accelerated when other strategies to increase the household income are in place. In the context of the broader interdisciplinary nutrition-sensitive program of which this study forms a part, the synergistic outcomes of improved crop production and poultry health are proposed to contribute to increased household income, less vulnerability to extreme weather events, greater willingness and capacity to invest in crop and poultry production and, ultimately, improved human nutrition outcomes.']"
2019-11-21T00:00:00Z,Socioeconomic determinants of nutritional status among ‘Baiga’ tribal children In Balaghat district of Madhya Pradesh: A qualitative study,"['As for the Baigas, the introduction of so-called ‘developmental policies’ of the government disrupted their self-reliant traditional ways of life and left them at the vagaries of the state. Their culture celebrated and fostered their close bond with the nature at the same time also emphasizing communal ownership and communal consumption, closely-knit kinship structures and minimal hierarchies. A deep-seated perception in India is that tribes are primitive communities with little or no order in society, and the developmental policies are therefore directed towards making them more civilized and socio-culturally evolved. Obviously, such a view is a product of the dominant culture’s prejudice against, and ignorance of, the culture of both settled and nomadic tribal peoples, particularly those deemed primitives, since each of these groups, of course, used to have its own customs, traditions and laws.Apart from the administration’s indifferent attitude, the poor education status strengthens their beliefs in superstitions, which acts a barrier for the administration to convince them to take up health services or provide them health education. The poor nutritional status of Baiga children could be attributed broadly to poor socioeconomic status of the Baiga households–lack of employment opportunities, poor education status, strong cultural and religious beliefs, geographic and climatic conditions, which affect the quality, quantity as well as availability of food, and treatment seeking behavior impacting the child’s nutrition status.The administration should emphasize the detriments of open defecation and promote awareness regarding hygienic practices as well as how it can improve their conditions. Facilitation of aids for construction of personal or community toilets may encourage them to use it. Generating employment opportunities, which makes use of their traditional skills like collecting honey, herbs, etc. from forests, could prove helpful in addressing the problem of unemployment. As their poor economic condition is the root cause affecting the food availability, the Baiga women go to search for daily labour work even during pregnancy to earn some cash.Lack of even basic amenities adversely affects the children’s nutrition status directly or indirectly. There is a need to sensitize the public servants serving in these tribal areas so that they have a better understanding of the tribes. To improve the service uptake of public services, it is necessary to remove some bottlenecks such as illiteracy, geographical barriers and sensitivity towards the tribes. The onus lies on the state and its administration to facilitate services in a way that encourages the tribal people to access public institutions as well as to utilize them. Until, the basic services and needs of the tribes are satisfied, just providing supplementary nutrition is hardly going to bring any change in the children’s nutrition status and overall growth and development. The policies schemes designed for them must be framed by including their inputs instead of using the top-down approach. For instance, a toilet which was built adjacent to the primary school was utilized for storing grains and not for the original purpose. Including them and encouraging their participation will give them a sense of ownership and will help bridge the gap of trust between both parties. Thus, the consistently high prevalence of malnutrition among these children cannot be attributed to a single factor; actually it is a result of the cascading effect of a number of factors which are interlinked among themselves. For policymakers it is therefore important to frame policies which address the issue in a holistic way, because targeting a single factor will not be enough.']"

Sheep with a history of late gestation overnutrition, however, were resistant towards such adverse long-term impacts of obesity development during adolescence, since they attained normal metabolic adaptability in adulthood upon normalization of their diet for 2 years. Early obesity development was associated with a complete lack of expansion of PRF but not of other adipose tissues from adolescence to adulthood, resulting in MESF constituting a greater proportion of intra-abdominal fat. Prenatal undernutrition had a similar but much less pronounced effect. This was not associated with adverse metabolic features per se in adulthood, except in individuals with a history of mismatching foetal undernutrition. It may thus be appropriate to consider differential nutritional strategies for individuals born at different extremes of the birth weight spectrum. Both males and females manifest these long-term consequences of pre- and early postnatal nutrition.']"

Along with these individual aspects, societal and environmental factors including campus culture, lifestyle, peer influence, academic activities, and food prices and availability were found to be influential in determining eating habits. The study also suggests that the knowledge regarding nutrition is poor among the resident graduates. However, campus life should possibly provide the students with crucial opportunities to develop healthy eating habits and adopt a balanced diet which form a strong basis for good health throughout life. Therefore, interventions need to consider individual, societal, environmental, and contextual factors in order to aim at increasing healthy eating behaviors and improving the dietary intake of university students.']"
2013-08-02T00:00:00Z,Evaluation of Nutritional and Antioxidant Status of Lepidium latifolium Linn.: A Novel Phytofood from Ladakh,"['Our study showed that the ecotype of Lepidium latifolium present in Ladakh Himalayas does contain nutritionally significant levels of fatty acids and glucosinolates. The presence of high amount of sinigrin is of particular significance as its degradation product amounts to allyl isothiocyanates, which have known health alleviating properties. Leaves of this plant were found to contain among the highest amount of sinigrin among phytofoods. The plant was also reported to contain higher amount of linolenic acid and higher PUFA/SFA ratio, which is desirable for any food. The nutritive value of its leaves was found even higher than some of the widely used vegetable and fruits of family Brassicaceae. Apart from its nutritive properties, it was shown to contain substantial antioxidant activities. Although tender top leaves are mostly used in food preparations, our results showed that leaves at all the positions contain substantial nutritional and antioxidant properties (Table 5). Total amount of phenols and flavanoids were shown to be correlated with radical scavenging properties in this plant. It is therefore proposed that consumption of its leaves needs to be promoted as they can compensate to the dietary requirements of the local folk. This is of more significance given the fact that it is cold tolerant plant, leaves of which survive for the longest time during the harsh winters of Ladakh.

2013-10-14T00:00:00Z,A Preference Based Measure of Complementary Feeding Quality: Application to the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children,"['To date there has been no appropriate index for assessing diet quality during the complementary feeding period in developed countries. In this paper we have described the development of a preference-based index for measuring adherence to infant feeding guidelines. The index provides utility (preference) scores on a generic scale where non-adherence to guidelines \u200a=\u200a0 and perfect adherence \u200a=\u200a1. Such scoring systems have been used in the development of health indices [30]. Here we have attempted to make use of the utility theory in nutritional epidemiology. By converting the dietary intakes into utilities we have a technique where summing the utilities of index components that are measured on different scales is meaningful. The strength of the proposed methodology lies in the axioms used to derive it. This is an improvement from using arbitrary cut offs to derive component scores and assumptions of linearity to combine component scores. Moreover, we have proven geometrically that the method of combining scores using the displaced ideal has advantages over the simple linear averaging. By an axiomatic characterization and empirical verification we have shown that the DI method of combining the scores distinguishes between individuals who achieve midrange scores by scoring consistently across components compared with individuals whose midrange scores reflect adherence at the extremes across components. We feel this is an advantage because a very low score places the individual at greater risk of suboptimal nutrition on that component. Thus, the DI method of combining the scores captures uniformity and balanced behaviour across different nutritional dimensions, unlike the LA method where the exchangeability assumption is forced. The CFI also signals those components in which individuals are adhering and not adhering to guidelines. Currently used diet quality scores contain many subjective choices (e.g. cut-offs). By using a utility approach we provide a data driven method that is reproducible and not subjective in nature. In addition, by providing a scoring range for each component we provide a technique that allows judgement of intakes of foods or nutrients that are both beneficial and detrimental, thus making the transition from beneficial to detrimental more subtle. This is a major advance over the existing cut-off based indices. One of the limitations, as noted in the literature [2], [3], [8], with the diet quality measures is their lack of ability to predict health outcomes. However, in our recent work we showed that CFUI predicts outcomes [31]. In future work, we will examine weighting of CFUI components. To acknowledge, the CFUI is one of the few indices that enable assessment of complementary feeding quality [7], a nutritionally and behaviourally important period. With its methodological advances and demonstrated associations with health and development outcomes in childhood, the CFUI can be used to guide the development and evaluation of early life nutrition promotion activities.']"
2016-03-30T00:00:00Z,Linking Measures of Colony and Individual Honey Bee Health to Survival among Apiaries Exposed to Varying Agricultural Land Use,"['Taken together, our results indicate that colonies positioned in apiaries surrounded by the most potential forage collect more pollen and nectar resources over the summer. Such colonies also generally contain more brood and lower Varroa mite infestation rates in the fall, and have a higher overwintering success rate. Individual honey bees within those colonies possess a quantifiably better nutritional status by the end of the foraging season (September). Likely as a result of this higher quality nutritional state, bees in those colonies displayed a less activated immune system, as evidenced by their decreased humoral immune response. Conversely, colonies positioned at sites with the least area in potential bee forage expressed some of the lowest nutritional stores (vitellogenin, insulin-like peptide1, lipids generally) and highest levels of humoral immunity. Importantly, our combined model was consistent with the two separate models of colony and individual bee measures (i.e. the best combined model contained pollen collection, brood, Varroa, and def1). The combined modeling indicated that colony measures were more strongly indicative of apiary survival that those taken from individual bees. Individual bee measures were taken from a fewer number of hives than colony measures, and none of the individual-bee sampled colonies actually died over the winter. These factors likely contributed to this result. We would expect a greater divergence of individual bee physiological indicators to emerge if taken from bees with a more varied colony health background, such as visually weak or diseased autumn colonies.Potential trade-offs between nutrition and immunity have been previously observed in honey bees in the lab, specifically between vitellogenin and defensin1, wherein immune stimulation resulted in increased AMP defense and a concurrent decrease in vitellogenin expression [68]. Further, stimulation of the Toll signaling pathway in Drosophila has been shown to lead to a decrease in nutrient stores [58]. In terms of our field study, the improved nutritional (higher) and immunological (quieter) states of bees in September at sites with higher survival were those surrounded by more forage throughout the summer and this may explain the differences observed in overwintering survival among the study sites.Future research on honey bee colonies positioned across a broader variety of landscapes and beekeeping practices is planned to test how robust the predictors of colony and apiary survival are. Efforts to identify absolute levels of particular genes and other physiological measures relating to health and survival may prove fruitful in providing beekeepers and researchers alike with a reliable tool or metric to accurately and objectively assess the status of their hives. If beekeepers were able to obtain measures of gene expression, it would enable them to assess and identify particular sites where colonies are at an increased risk of failure (due to relatively lower nutritional and/or higher immune measures) and thus may need to be closely monitored and possibly treated for parasites and diseases, or nutritionally supplemented. Beekeepers may even choose to withhold treatments and supplements from such colonies if they are likely to perish over the winter regardless of interventions. Such a “blood test” for bees would be a breakthrough in the ongoing struggle to maintain healthy, live colonies of honey bees to meet the current demands for pollination, support a robust beekeeping industry, and ensure a safe and reliable food system.This study uncovered measures of honey bee health and immunity relating to apiary-level phenomena, i.e. apiary survival, influenced by landscape suitability. While much interest exists regarding the effects of land use on honey bee (and other pollinator) health and survival, little data exist on which to build coherent real-world policies that will significantly improve the situation for honey bees and other pollinators. As such, this study is a novel first step toward identifying pertinent physiological responses that honey bees may have as a result of their positioning near varying landscape features in intensive agricultural environments.']"

2015-10-14T00:00:00Z,Nutritional Differences between Two Orangutan Habitats: Implications for Population Density,"['In summary, our data support a link between bottom-up regulatory factors, variation in nutritional intake of a mostly frugivorous mammal species, and population density. This study has implications for the conservation of viable habitat for endangered frugivores like orangutans. Peat-swamp forests hold the largest remaining relatively undisturbed populations of Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) and are considered excellent habitats for orangutans [56,58,60]. As more orangutans are relocated due to agricultural pressures, specifically the growing pressures of oil palm expansion in peatland habitats [107,108], finding suitable habitats that provide sufficient energy for orangutans has become an increasing challenge [109]. Here, we have shown that what appears to be similar habitat does not necessarily translate into similar nutrient intake of its inhabitants. Our results indicate that reductions in habitat quality that would be expected following human disturbance, and consequently the availability of higher-quality fruits, are likely to lead to negative impacts on orangutan nutrition, with potential long-term impacts on population density. This suggests that it is important to incorporate careful habitat quality assessment and maintenance into future conservation action plans for this endangered species.']"

Furthermore, the father’s level of education, buying and/or using iodized salt, iodine level of household salt, frequency of milk and cabbage consumption, eating status of egg and dark green vegetables/fruits were associated factors of goiter among school age children. Therefore, Anchar district health and education sectors should work together in disseminating messages to increase the awareness of the community on how to prevent goiter through the consumption of iodized salt, and iodine rich foods.\nImplications of the study\nThis study cannot be generalized to the national level and it may not influence the Ethiopian national food and nutrition policy. However, it can be used as an input, with other similar studies, in conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses, thereby improving the national policy. In addition, it can be used as baseline information for further epidemiological and nutritional studies in similar settings. Moreover, the results of this study can help clinicians in decision making with regard to goiter diagnosis in the study area or similar settings.\n']"

Our comparative transcriptome produced 53,519 unigenes (including 21,635 contigs and 31,844 singlets) for the swimming crab. Of these unigenes with ORFs, 11,039 sequences were matched to the known species while only 2,773 annotated sequences were identified as belonging to crustacean species. Further analysis revealed 33,427 unigenes with ORFs were found in the hepatopancreas while 25,210 sequences were hepatopancreatic-specific. There were 14, 534, and 22 identified genes involved in food digestion, nutrition metabolism and ovarian development, respectively. Digital expression analysis revealed that 212 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found between the growth and endogenous stage hepatopancreas, while 382 DEGs were identified between the endogenous and exogenous stage hepatopancreas. Our results will not only provide valuable genomic information for the understanding of hepatopancreatic roles in nutrition metabolism and ovarian development for P. trituberculatus, but also facilitate further investigations of functional genomics for this species and other closely related species.']"
2019-01-15T00:00:00Z,Plant-based (vegan) diets for pets: A survey of pet owner attitudes and feeding practices,"['This study represents the first investigation into the prevalence of meat-avoidance in the pet owner population. The prevalence of vegetarianism and veganism was higher in the pet owner sample than has been reported in the general population, accounting for approximately 12% of pet owners in the sample population. To put that into perspective, in the USA alone, with its population of 325 million [98] and a national a pet-owning rate estimated at 56% [54], there may be as many as 20 million vegetarian and vegan pet owners. Given that the concerns regarding animal-based pet foods reported by vegan and vegetarian pet owners surveyed appear to be the same concerns that they feel regarding animal-products in their own diets, a large number of these pet owners likely desire alternative diets for their pets. Indeed, nearly one-quarter of vegan pet owners reported currently feeding their pets a plant-based diet, while almost half of those who indicated they did not currently do so reported that they would if there were a plant-based diet available which met their standards. For the majority of pet owners interested in feeding a plant-based diet to their pet, the major obstacle was a lack of evidence of nutritional sufficiency. These results suggest a discordance between perceived or real availability of suitable plant-based pet foods and the demand for evidence-based complete and balanced plant-based pet foods. It is clear that an association exists between the diet a pet owner has chosen to follow and the diet they choose to feed their pet. Nutritional sufficiency of most plant-based diets has yet to be demonstrated, while few studies have investigated the short or long-term effects of plant-based diets on pet health. Considering the number of pet owners found to be feeding, or interested in feeding, plant-based diets to pets, and the implications on pet health, nutrition, and the pet food market, more research is warranted regarding plant-based foods for dogs and cats.']"
2018-09-14T00:00:00Z,‘Yellow is good for you’: Consumer perception and acceptability of fortified and biofortified cassava products,"['Our study shows that novel biofortified cassava products, namely eba and fufu, were well accepted by local consumers and that yellow colour did not make a difference to acceptability. An interesting observation was that the traditional yellow-coloured RPO-fortified eba product was not as acceptable as the biofortified product of the same colour and this was because the fortified product had less desirable sensory characteristics (possibly due to the addition of palm oil). Good acceptance of biofortified cassava products shows that the barrier to acceptance of novel nutritious food is lower than expected in rural areas of Africa, providing that these products have acceptable sensory characteristics. According to the results of this study, it is anticipated that eba and fufu made from yellow biofortified cassava are likely to be well accepted by local Nigerian populations.We used a range of methods to describe the sensory and nutritional perception of the products: a classic sensory analysis with a semi-trained panel and two more recent sensory methods with consumers (CATA and JAR). The methods gave consistent results in terms of sensory description of the products. Moreover, the CATA method added another dimension (nutritional perception) to describe products. To our knowledge, it was the first time that the CATA and JAR methods have been used on biofortified crops in a low-and-middle-income- country setting and this shows that there is potential to develop quality nutritional and sensory profiling using consumers with a limited level of formal education.There was not a clear perception of the link between health benefits (‘good for eye sight’ and ‘good for children’s health’) and the yellow colour of the products. Consumers mistakenly considered that the yellow fortified product was equivalent to white cassava products in terms of health benefits. Hence consumers were not aware of the correlation between yellow colour (in RPO-fortified or biofortified cassava products) and provitamin A. These findings highlight a gap in knowledge in local populations who are beneficiaries of biofortification programs and we advocate for dietary diversification and training programmes that will equally promote biofortified foods and vitamin A-rich- local foods.']"

This positive effect may lead to a greater protection against the bone loss that occurs later in life, when bones become thinner, resulting in a loss of strength to cracks and/or collapses. Furthermore, maternal prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin supplementation and Ca fortification produce a better structural base not only at spongiosa but also at the cortical vertebra of offspring bones, producing an increase in the offspring peak bone mass and, therefore, could help delaying the bone loss produced in adulthood and the risk of developing osteoporosis. Thus, based on our study results, prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin supplementation in non-deficient nutritional conditions may be considered as a plausible nutritional option for pregnant and lactating women rather than Ca supplementation, for maximizing the peak of bone mass in the offspring from the growing period till adolescence, and for protection of the maternal bone mass during gestation and lactation as a strategy to increase bone strength and to prevent bone fragility after menopause.']"

The nutrient element levels suggested that Cenococcum geophilum plays a stronger role in plant S nutrition, Lactarius subdulcis in plant P nutrition, and Clavulina cristata in belowground Ca retention than the other analyzed fungi. Root cells of ash colonized by Glomus sp. contained outstanding K concentrations, but in contrast to our expectation not the highest P concentrations.Ash trees are known to influence their soil environment by affecting the cation balance. Our results imply a major role of AM in this important ecosystem function. Currently, we cannot distinguish whether AM are responsible for high K acquisition from soil minerals or whether they have high capacities for K retention and efficiently recapture cations released from degrading leaf litter. This should be clarified in future studies. It should be emphasized that our results, obtained at a subcellular level, open new views on ecosystem functions and services at higher scales. Ash is a tree species with a wide ecological amplitude that gains importance as a component in mixed forests that are more suitable to withstand global climate change [59]. When forest tree composition is changed to cope with the challenges of global change, it is important to consider the consequences for symbiotic interactions and the edaphic environment.']"

Whatever the legume used, the cooking and rheological properties of pasta, its microscopic structure and the strength of its protein network clearly differed from those of gluten-free cereal pasta. Legume pasta is up to 2 to 6 times richer in fiber and produced a weaker protein network, which was mainly formed during the cooking step in comparison to the cereal gluten-free pasta in which drying is the step that leads to the creation of the protein network. The texture of the legume pasta was therefore weaker with notably low springiness scores. Interestingly, all legume pasta, which is three times richer in protein than gluten-free cereal pasta, lost less material during cooking. If most legume pasta structure and properties were similar, some differences were noticeable depending on the legume used for pasta production. Black-gram pasta had better rheological and cooking properties related to its particular richness in arabinogalactan fibers.From a nutritional point of view, in addition to their high protein content, the legume pasta also contained higher resistant starch than gluten-free cereal pasta. Furthermore, the remaining available starch in faba and lentil pasta was more slowly digested than the starch of gluten-free cereal pasta. This interesting in-vitro starch digestion profile could predict a lower glycemic index. However, even if legumes appear to be promising for the production of gluten-free pasta, their anti-nutritional factors need to be known. Trypsin inhibitory activity and the α-galactoside content can be drastically reduced during legume processing into pasta that includes a cooking step. Phytic acid was less affected by pasta processing, making germination, fermentation of legume grains or flours prior to pasta processing a promising option [22, 61].In conclusion, the promising nutritional quality of legume pasta, notably their richness in protein and fibers and their potential low glycemic index could be of interest to expand the range of gluten-free cereal pasta available on the market today.']"
2016-08-10T00:00:00Z,The Great Irish Famine: Identifying Starvation in the Tissues of Victims Using Stable Isotope Analysis of Bone and Incremental Dentine Collagen,"['This study is the first to use the stable isotope analysis of nitrogen and carbon in human dentine to identify changes related to a well-documented historical period of famine. These data are a poignant reminder of the extreme conditions suffered by the children buried at Kilkenny, but also clearly demonstrate that the intervention provided by the introduction of maize allowed many to recover: their nitrogen isotope ratios return to dietary rather than stress levels, and they survived beyond the dietary change. The ability of the human body to adapt to nutritional deprivation and survive, returning to homeostasis, is clear within these profiles.Although the change in diet from a C3 to a C4-based diet is recorded in the isotope ratios of the adult rib bone collagen, it is difficult to resolve the age at which this occurred because of averaging as a result of bone turnover. Using evidence from the dentine collagen δ13C and δ15N profiles and the historical records for both the importation of maize and the timing of cemetery closure we have been able to identify more precisely when in their lifetime the children from this study who died during the Famine period received relief food. The raised δ15N and lower δ13C (famine pattern of opposing covariance) in the dentine profiles of the children is marked by the return to lower δ15N values and higher δ13C in the maize pattern of opposing covariance. Short-term δ13C and δ15N changes in dentine resulting from physiological, in this case specifically nutritional, stress has not previously been demonstrated in an historical population where the records of the period of famine can be related to individuals who suffered. Further work needs to be undertaken to refine the ageing of each increment, both chronological age and the period of time represented, and whether partially mineralised teeth need ageing differently to complete ones. Nonetheless, this study shows that using incremental dentine collagen δ13C and δ15N analysis it is possible to identify periods of physiological stress such as famine in both adult and juvenile skeletons if it occurred during tooth development, i.e. up to approximately 23 years of age. This could have important forensic and archaeological applications for the identification of populations and individuals for whom nutritional stress may have contributed to their death.']"

The exposure to the HFS diet after birth also induced long-lasting changes in voluntary feed intake, growth and feed efficiency in piglets, which may have resulted from early post-weaning AA restriction. Our study also emphasises the importance of the interactions between in utero and early postnatal nutrition for the behavioural development of the offspring, as some behavioural effects of postnatal exposure to the HFS diet depended on the prenatal dietary history. Further studies are needed to determine which factors, such as maternal and offspring metabolic status, diet composition or digestive enzymatic activity, underlie the equivocal results found between our study and prior research in rodents. Considering the current socio-economic context characterised by the widespread availability of diet high in fat and refined sugars, the characterisation of dietary or metabolic factors underlying the effects of a perinatal high-fat high-sugar high-cholesterol diet on behaviour in pigs could have interesting applications in terms of dietary recommendations for perinatal nutrition in humans.']"

Using the criteria of two EU-level nutrient profile models, our study suggests that a sizable share of pre-packaged foods in the categories of breakfast cereals, ready meals, processed meat, processed seafood, and yoghurts, contributes to these excessive intakes in Europe. Consequently, additional improvements to the food supply or consumption habits will be needed to achieve the necessary population diet improvements and meet international goals and targets, such as the voluntary WHO NCD targets [47] and the sustainable development goal 3.4 [48]. Reformulation and restricted marketing of those foods that most contribute the above nutrients to people's (including children's) diets are seen as key measures in the move towards health-promoting food environments. Among others, nutrient profiling helps to provide targets for food product improvement and criteria for checking which products may be deemed suitable for marketing to children. More efforts in monitoring the nutritional composition of the food supply as well as complementary measures, such as fiscal measures, clear nutrition information, marketing restrictions, and public procurement criteria for food can provide additional and strong incentives and a level playing field for producers towards a more healthful food supply overall.""]"

Our patients demonstrated a continuous muscle depth loss and negative nitrogen balance over the 14 days of the study. Catabolism remained dominant throughout the study period whilst there appeared to be a marginal improvement in inflammation. No obvious ‘nutritional tipping point” to identify anabolism or recovery could be identified in our cohort. Our ICU patient cohort is one with a moderately prolonged stay; a very important group due to their high resource requirement. This group showed little consistency in data, reflecting the individuality of both disease and response. Thus the data are consistent with a conclusion that a time based assumption of a tipping point does not exist. This supports an argument for individually characterising patient state and personalising the approach; be that with a yet to be identified metabolic marker, a novel method or a device.\nKey messages\n\nIn this ICU patient cohort with moderately prolonged stay, catabolism remained elevated throughout 14 days follow up even though inflammation improved marginally.\nCRP does not appear to be a good surrogate marker to assess anabolism and recovery.\nOur data did not demonstrate an obvious time point where anabolism starts to exceed catabolism or ‘nutritional tipping point’.\nThere is a need to individually characterise patient state and personalise the approach.\n\n']"
2018-12-17T00:00:00Z,Characterization of canola oil extracted by different methods using fluorescence spectroscopy,"['Fluorescence spectroscopy along with chemometric analysis have been employed to study the effect of extraction methods on the nutritional values of canola oil. It has been found that canola oil extracted by cold press method is rich with fat soluble vitamins, vitamin E, beta carotene and chlorophylls. Similarly, chemically extracted oil possesses almost same molecular composition as that of cold press but the refining processes destroy its nutritional values. Therefore, if chemically extracted oil is not refined through the processes described in the text then the end users can enjoy its natural ingredients. In addition, it seems difficult to find the origin of commercial brands named as canola oil, as their spectra reflect only oxidized products. Furthermore, it has been investigated that the heating of cold pressed canola oil up to 180°C, does not lose most of its valuable ingredients. Therefore, it can be used safely for cooking of foods where usually temperature remains between 100–115 oC. In addition, present studies suggested that cold pressed canola oil can be used safely without destroying much of its valuable ingredients for frying of egg which needs temperature range 140–160°C and deep frying of meat and fish that needs temperature of oil around 180°C.']"
2019-12-04T00:00:00Z,Processed and ultra-processed foods are associated with high prevalence of inadequate selenium intake and low prevalence of vitamin B1 and zinc inadequacy in adolescents from public schools in an urban area of northeastern Brazil,"['In conclusion, an increase in the proportion of energy obtained from processed and ultra-processed foods by adolescents from public schools, was associated with an increase in the prevalence of inadequate selenium intake, which could lead to short-term and long-term negative health consequences. However, energy consumption from processed and ultra-processed foods was associated with a lower probability of inadequate vitamin B1 intake. In addition, a lower probability of inadequate zinc intake was observed only for energy consumption from ultra-processed foods, possibly attributed to food fortification. Considering the risk of micronutrient intake exceeding the UL, and the fact that ultra-processed foods are energy-dense, with high levels of fat, sugar, and/or sodium, we believe that it is crucial to stress the importance of limiting personal consumption of processed and ultra-processed foods, especially among the pediatric population. The position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics highlights that early care and education programs should recommended, from an early age, a high standard of nutritional quality for foods and beverages served. Efforts to promote healthy eating should be a national priority and include state and local policy changes [65]. Accordingly, the results of this study can help provide evidence for formulating global public policies that improve health in adolescence and prevent complications in adulthood.']"

The child anthropometric indices were found affected by the studied women’s as well as men’s intrinsic factors. Both maternal autonomy (for WHZ) and paternal engagement in care (for HAZ) were found determinants of child nutrition in the setting. Furthermore, optimal feeding, sex of the child and food insecurity were also remained significant predictors. Thus, nutrition interventions in such setting should integrate enhancing women’s autonomy over resource and Men’s involvement in childcare and feeding, besides food security measures.\nLimitation of the study\nMany factors may likely underpin these findings, and, they should be thoroughly examined in future longitudinal and qualitative studies. Based on our current analysis, we cannot reliably parse out and attribute our findings without mentioning the validity of our instruments. Though the DHS and Lamb et al., approaches are widely used, the inherent difference across territories may hamper their sensitivity and specificity in measuring such complex variables. Available systematic reviews on such topics addressed the need for optimal clarity, reliability and validity of tools used for intrinsic variables such as autonomy and empowerment in different population groups and settings [66–67]. Thus we acknowledge our efforts to measure and quantify women’s autonomy and or men’s involvement in care may have been affected by methodological constraints.

2015-08-13T00:00:00Z,"Influence of Urbanization on Body Size, Condition, and Physiology in an Urban Exploiter: A Multi-Component Approach","['We found no evidence of an effect of urbanization on the condition of house sparrows during two energy-demanding stages (early post-fledging and breeding periods). By using an integrative multi-component approach, incorporating morphological, structural and physiological measures from both breeding adults and juveniles from four different sites, we also demonstrated that adult urban sparrows are not energetically constrained by the urban environment. Conversely, our results strongly suggest that the urban nutritional environment is inadequate or of insufficient quality to satisfy all nutritional requirements of developing sparrows, and therefore, that the urban environments are likely to energetically constrain free-living birds during their developmental phase only. However, the long-term consequences of growing in an urban environment remain unclear and future studies should explore these questions by comparing urban and rural populations [22,54]. More generally, the study of the consequences of urban life on wildlife may benefit from adopting experimental approaches (e.g., see [19,93,111,116,126]) to disentangle the relative importance of confounding factors (e.g., food quality versus predictability and/or quantity, urban noise, pollution, predation) on performances. These experimental studies will also help ecologists to assess the mechanisms underlying organismal responses to urbanization.

Nutrients N, K, and B were higher in fuzzy seeds than fuzzless seeds, but the concentrations of these nutrients in fuzzless seed were higher in leaves than in seeds, opposing the trend in fuzzy seeds, may be due to limited translocation of these nutrients from leaves to seeds due to unknown mechanisms. The positive response of K, N, and B in leaves and seeds to foliar B application under well-watered or water stress conditions dependent on genotype, allowing for possible selection for more responsive genotypes to B application. Water-stress altered both amount and trend of seed nutrients in seeds and leaves. Foliar application of B under water stress may not increase B in seeds, may be due to limited movement of B from leaves to seed due to water stress, may indicate that the beneficial effects of foliar B under water is limited. Under water stress, the contribution of cell wall B to the total B exceeded 90%, supporting the structural role of B in plants. Foliar B application decreased the contribution of cell wall B to the total B, may be due to the non-limiting availability of B in the cell. Further research at the biochemical and molecular levels is needed to understand mechanisms controlling the distribution of seed nutrition. To evaluate the stability of the trait and its effects on seed nutrition, more lines under different environments need to be investigated.']"
2016-05-17T00:00:00Z,"Forests, Trees, and Micronutrient-Rich Food Consumption in Indonesia","['Much of the policy rhetoric on food security in Indonesia focuses on production of more rice since it is the main staple food (and thus source of calories) and also important for cultural, political and historical reasons [70]. Increased rice production however, does not address the widespread problem of micronutrient deficiency. Government run micronutrient supplementation programs and public-private partnerships encouraging fortification have been the primary policies targeted at reducing micronutrient deficiencies with little attention paid to dietary quality.The results here suggest that the nature of the landscape and the agrarian context may affect dietary quality and such factors should be considered in both land use policies as well as those aimed at improving nutrition. Our results suggest that forests and tree-based systems could play an important role in supporting dietary quality in Indonesia, but further research is necessary for understanding the exact mechanisms and the regional differences in such relationships.While the results for the aggregate data do not show strong associations between tree dominated land classes and diet, the provincial level analyses exhibit interesting relationships. We do not believe that these results are conclusive, but that they are suggestive enough of important relationships between forests, tree-based systems, and nutrition to warrant further investigation. The fact that the models run on the aggregate sample do not reflect the provincial level results underscores the importance of more targeted research at the local level across different regions of Indonesia. More detailed data on both quantities of food consumed as well as on the definitive land use from different regions is necessary before arriving at conclusions and policy recommendations.Natural forest and semi-natural forest characterized by swidden/agroforestry were positively associated with a larger number of nutritionally important food groups in provinces dominated by these land uses, than timber and palm oil plantations were in the provinces dominated by these land uses. The swidden/agroforestry land use was associated with more frequent consumption of animal source foods which is a particularly important and limited food group for the poor in developing countries. These results together suggest that the nutritional benefits associated with commercial plantations may not be sufficient to compensate for the loss of previous benefits obtained from natural forests and swidden/agroforestry systems. Such a hypothesis however, can only be tested through detailed and rigorous investigation at local scales.']"
2016-12-19T00:00:00Z,Site-Dependent Differences in DNA Methylation and Their Impact on Plant Establishment and Phosphorus Nutrition in Populus trichocarpa,"['In this research project, clonal Populus trichocarpa (cv. Muhle Larson) material derived from two different short rotation forestry sites in northern Germany with different environmental conditions, like P availability, was analyzed. The establishment of cuttings in full nutrition depended on their history, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms might be involved. Indeed, genome-wide DNA methylation differences were identified. Expression analysis of differentially methylated genes and promoters showed a minor repression of DNA methylation in promoters and sites close to the transcriptional starting site on gene expression with overall little relation to the P supply. It is therefore possible that the massive transient DNA methylation close to genes related to P starvation, recently reported for nutrient-solution-grown rice [5], is not found in perennial poplar, but it is possible that in the native environments where the poplar plant material was derived from, other stresses were more pronounced and the low P stress was not sufficient to induce measurable changes in DNA methylation of P starvation-related genes. Nevertheless, differentially methylated miRNA sequences and their predicted targets indicated not only a site-dependent, but also P-related expression difference. Overall, the better nutrient-supplied plants derived from Wallstawe seemed to be more adaptive to environmental stresses, including P starvation, than Anderlingen (Fig 8). Thus, site-specific and species-specific epigenetic modifications might be responsible for different adaptations to low P. Such epigenetic aspects must be accounted for plant breeding and biodiversity studies, especially of vegetatively propagated perennials, like poplar.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0168623.g008\nFig 8\n\nSchema of site-dependent differences in DNA methylation and their impact on plant establishment in clonal Populus trichocarpa.\nTwo different short rotation forestry sites (Anderlingen vs. Wallstawe) are shown; where the same Populus trichocarpa clone (cv. Muhle Larson) is grown. Growth conditions differ on the two sites, e.g. phosphate availability. DNA nucleotides are presented as T (thymine), G (guanine), A (adenine) and C (cytosine). Analysis of the DNA methylation pattern (red in DNA sequence) has revealed differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in all C contexts (blue in DNA sequence) between plants derived from Anderlingen or Wallstawe. A causal relationship between DNA methylation in coding regions and gene expression changes still remains unclear: In Anderlingen plants, the methylation rate in coding regions has no effect on gene expression (blue waves), independent from optimal (+P) or deficient (−P) phosphorus nutrition. In Wallstawe plants, methylation level in coding regions is negatively correlated with the gene expression (indicated by black dashed T-shaped bar). This observation is independent from phosphorus nutrition (indicated by neutral grey arrows). Though, DNA methylation has a different impact on DMR-regulated miRNAs and their targets: In Anderlingen plants, miRNA expression is not related to phosphorus supply or DNA methylation. Therefore, gene expression of their targets in both conditions is not different. In Wallstawe plants, miRNA expression depends on the phosphorus nutrition. −P leads to lower DMR-regulated miRNA expression (indicated by black arrows) and thereby to higher target gene expression. +P leads to a higher DMR-regulated miRNA expression and thereby to a lower target gene expression (indicated by a black arrow and T-shaped bar).\n\n\n']"
2015-09-09T00:00:00Z,"Healthcare Costs Associated with an Adequate Intake of Sugars, Salt and Saturated Fat in Germany: A Health Econometrical Analysis","['As investigated in this study, an association of dietary factors (in particular an excessive intake of MDS, salt and SFA) and of clinical endpoints with related treatment costs exists for a broad set of diseases, with direct healthcare costs totalling 16.8 billion EUR in Germany (CI95%: 6.3–24.1 billion EUR). In other words: These costs could be saved if people’s intake of MDS, salt and SFA were adequate. However, since this study only considered direct medical treatment costs related to an adequate intake, the actual potential societal and economic gains—resulting both from direct and indirect cost savings—may be higher than 16.8 billion EUR. Moreover, against the backdrop of a steadily ageing society and the foreseeable increases in disease burdens over the coming decades, this figure may well rise (not only nominally, but also when adjusted for inflation).It follows that measures aimed at optimizing diets and recipes could be used as effective leverage in order to relieve pressure on healthcare, health insurance and national tax levy systems. Health insurance companies, governmental institutions, but also commercial enterprises, which should have an intrinsic interest in the health of their employees and customers, will therefore be required to develop proper incentive mechanisms that facilitate healthier nutrition. In particular, companies in the food, beverage and catering industries should be supported in their efforts to optimize existing recipes, and develop new ones (possibly by introducing new components) with enhanced nutritive performance, allowing all customers easier and healthier food choices.With regard to a possible fat substitution, it has to be kept in mind that the food matrix may have an influence on the nutritive impact of the specific component. With this in mind, when designing new fat substitutes it seems most important that substitutes meet the haptic and technological requirements of meat products (see discussion). Furthermore, when compared to SFAs, poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) showed the strongest risk-decreasing effect for developing ischemic heart diseases, followed by mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and carbohydrates.As far as a possible salt substitution is concerned, trade-offs must be considered with respect to an adequate iodine supply. Presently, more than 50% of the average iodine supply in Germany occurs via the intake of common table salt [20]. So if salt substitutes with a better nutritive profile are to be used in food products, it should be possible to enrich them with iodine.The findings of this study confirm the imperative of the UN High-Level Review on Non-Communicable Diseases, in which governments agreed to intensify and accelerate efforts towards creating a world free of the avoidable burden of NCDs [71]. The High-Level Review is based on the NCD Global Monitoring Framework (WHO, 2013) [72], which identified a set of nine core targets to minimize the impacts of NCDs by 2025. Four out of these nine core targets can be addressed by a balanced consumption of salt (targets 1, 4, 6 and 8), whereas target 7 (“Halt the rise in diabetes & obesity”) as well as target 1 (“A 25% relative reduction in the overall mortality from NCDs”) can be achieved by a balanced intake of MDS and SFA.']"

Food Availability and Disease May Affect Reproductive Output of Reintroduced Frogs","['The continued presence of L. aurea at the created habitat is a positive sign that L. aurea can persist in a created habitat. But the lack of breeding highlights the importance of habitat creation that facilitates all stages of a target-species’ life cycle. Due to intensive monitoring, we were able to investigate several factors that may have contributed to the absence of L. aurea breeding at the created habitat. As vegetation affects invertebrate abundance, and as nutritional up-take and disease both affect reproductive behaviour and physiology, it is likely that the combination of these factors was to blame for the absence of breeding. Fortunately, because this created habitat was used as a trial to inform larger-scale habitat creation, we have the opportunity to build upon this knowledge and integrate what we’ve learnt into an improved program. Future programs may benefit by the creation of ponds with more permanent hydro-periods and the placement of created habitat in close proximity to an extant population, planting a variety of plant species at each of the wetland zones (riparian, shoreline, and emergent) which may encourage oviposition and increase invertebrate abundance. The addition of plants that are known to attract invertebrates might also provide additional nutrition for reproduction and immune function. Recommendations to reduce Bd in the site should also be incorporated, and trialling artificial call playback may be worthwhile for stimulating breeding hormones and behaviour. This study exemplifies how monitoring and scientific analysis of a created habitat or reintroduction program can not only improve our understanding of the target species and ecological system, but also greatly improve existing, or initiate new adaptive management strategies.']"

Cuf.: Role in human nutrition,"['In addition to the high selenium concentration, Moringa spp. leaves are rich in proteins and β-carotene [4, 50], possess anti-oxidant properties [17], contain low concentrations of anti-nutrients [57–60], may be used in treating ailments [18, 61], the seeds are used as water coagulant [62], and they grow under marginal environmental conditions providing much needed ecological services (for example, shade, wind break, etc.). Moringa oleifera is naturalized while MS is indigenous to Kenya and Ethiopia. Where these species grow, the population have indigenous knowledge of their multiple uses including the high nutritive values [63]. Nonetheless, the utilization of these species as food is limited to specific localities and communities [8], they are neglected in terms of research and development, and the trees can be classed as underutilized crops [64, 65]. Agricultural and health extension work to popularise the production and consumption of MO and MS may be a useful strategy to complement efforts to alleviate dietary MNDs through dietary diversification, and use of Moringa leaf powders to fortify meals in the dry season when other leafy green vegetables are not available. In addition, variations in mineral micronutrient concentrations suggest that breeding efforts to increase the nutritional value of Moringa foliage may be successful. However, research is also required to determine the bioavailability of nutrients from Moringa edible parts. The Moringaceae belongs to the same order (Brassicales) as Brassicaceae [5] which are known to be Se accumulators [66, 67]. Hence further studies on the Se concentrations in edible portions of the other Moringa species are important to understand and exploit the potential of the family in the fight against human Se undernutrition.']"

Results show that yield increase have slowed down and even halted among rice, wheat and maize. Thus, keeping high yield of rice and upgrading medium- and low-yield fields of wheat and maize may be of more rationality and feasibility to further increase cereal yields approaching their potential yield. Additionally, the original findings of area change pattern show stagnation and collapse are prevailing in most growing areas of rice and wheat, making their production sustainability under great threat. By contrast, maize production is both prominent for yield and area trends in comparison with rice and wheat, especially for area. Upgrading medium- and low-yielding fields, other than expanding maize-growing areas is more beneficial in the environmental way. Thus, this integrated trend analysis on cereal yield and planted area in China provides the prototype to better understand production sustainability elsewhere in the world.Achieving food security needs long-term perspective, not only adequate food supply, but also considering nutritional content, individual preference and so on. The macroscopic strategies covering yield improvement, cropland conservation, modification in nutritional construction, and food trade are of substantial significance for sustainable development of agriculture to achieve food security in China.']"
2018-09-24T00:00:00Z,Dietary diversity determinants and contribution of fish to maternal and under-five nutritional status in Zambia,"['Wealth status, mother’s educational level and child’s age had an influence on the dietary diversity of children. Fish was the most consumed animal-source food by both women and children and can therefore contribute towards the much-needed nutrients from animal-source foods; especially in children aged 6–59 months. Small fish (Kapenta) is particularly important in the diets of children in poor urban households in Zambia and contributes to better nutritional outcomes. As all small fish stem from capture fisheries, sustainable one health environmental integration, monitoring and management strategies are desirable. Older children aged 24–59 months had a higher prevalence of stunting than those aged 6–23 months. This is attributed to inadequate nutrient adequacy of diets as observed in the low dietary diversity. Furthermore, there are factors that affect stunting that are age-related (e.g. feeding practices and other child care practices). Among the urban poor, both undernutrition, overweight and obesity among children and women are major problems that need a more focused attention by policy makers. The government and development partners should not only channel efforts to solving the stunting problem, but should also implement prevention programmes for overweight/ obesity which is on the increase, especially among children. Utilization of locally produced food in complementary feeding and ensuring that diets are diversified, combined with caring practices, education of mothers and proper sanitary environments are paramount to ensure optimal child nutrition.']"
2013-11-19T00:00:00Z,Biosynthesis of Vitamins and Cofactors in Bacterium-Harbouring Trypanosomatids Depends on the Symbiotic Association as Revealed by Genomic Analyses,"['The results obtained in this work are in agreement with earlier nutritional studies [3], [5], [9], [19] which indicated that trypanosomatids require seven vitamins in the culture media: folic and pantothenic acid, biotin, vitamin B6, riboflavin, thiamine, and nicotinic acid (Figure 12). As shown in the present study, this is related to the fact that such protozoa lack the complete set of genes that codify for the enzymes involved in these essential biosynthetic pathways. However, this nutritional requirement does not apply to trypanosomatids carrying a cytoplasmic endosymbiont. SHTs have the necessary enzymes to produce most vitamins, with the exception of thiamine, biotin, and nicotinic acid, which represent absolute nutritional requirements for trypanosomatids in general. Most of the genes related to the synthesis of riboflavin, vitamin B6, and folic acid were identified only in the symbiont genomes. This indicates the presence of complete biosynthetic routes in the TPEs with an exchange of metabolites between host and bacterium in the extremities of the pathway, i.e. precursors and end products. On the other hand, the same is not observed in the synthesis of pantothenic acid, as suggested by our analyses. This pathway might have a more intricate participation of both partners in intermediate steps. SHTs and TPEs are able to perform the conversion of the vitamins riboflavin and pantothenic acid into the essential metabolites FAD and CoA, which indicates that possibly the symbiont enhances the production of these metabolites which may be controlled by the host in a way that is not yet fully elucidated.10.1371/journal.pone.0079786.g012Figure 12\nOverview of the biosynthetic pathways of essential vitamins and cofactors in trypanosomatids.\nDashed arrows: metabolite import/exchange; dotted arrows: reaction present in only some of the organisms analyzed; solid arrows: other reactions (circles on the top of the arrows indicate number of steps and fulfilled circles indicate presence of enzyme); arrows surrounded by a gray box: enzymes possibly acquired through horizontal transfer from Bacteria to trypanosomatids (see main text). A - Contribution of SHTs and TPEs based on the analysis of gene content in the genomes of A. deanei, A. desouzai, S. culicis, S. oncopelti, S. galati and respective endosymbionts. B - Biochemical capability of trypanosomatids without symbionts based on the analysis of genomic data of H. muscarum, C. acanthocephali and L. major.\nAccording to the phylogenetic analyses, some genes coding for the enzymes involved in the biosynthetic and salvage pathways of vitamins and cofactors are in the host genome and are of eukaryotic origin, while most genes are localized in the genomes of the symbionts and are of betaproteobacterial ancestry. On the other hand, three genes were possibly transferred from bacteria to the trypanosomatid nuclei. Such is the case of the ketopantoate reductase gene (EC:1.1.1.169) involved in the de novo biosynthesis of pantothenic acid, which was probably transferred from a Firmicutes bacterium to an ancestor of the SHT host and of H. muscarum. The two other sequences may have been acquired from Gammaproteobacteria: nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase (EC:2.4.2.11), which is involved in the salvage pathway of nicotic acid, and UbiC (EC:4.1.3.40), which is involved in the synthesis of ubiquinone.Taken together, the nutritional data and our genomic analysis show that SHTs are autotrophic for riboflavin, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, and folic acid [6], [7], [9], [21]. As a result, we can assume that the shared participation of the trypanosomatid host and of its symbiont in the synthesis of vitamins evidences an extensive metabolic exchange between both partners, at the extremities of the pathways or maybe even at intermediate steps, and that this exchange has an essential role in the maintenance of this mutualistic association.']"
2013-12-10T00:00:00Z,Site Distribution at the Edge of the Palaeolithic World: A Nutritional Niche Approach,"['Based on our analysis of multi-disciplinary data we propose that the distribution of the richest Lower to Middle Palaeolithic archaeological sites in this part of northwest Europe is a real behavioural distribution reflecting hominin activity patterns rather than a taphonomic distribution. During the last four interglacials the location of the richest Palaeolithic sites in terms of biface densities is strongly biased to the lower reaches of river valleys and sites which were above NTL but in proximity to tidal rivers and estuaries. This may also have been the case earlier, as suggested by marine molluscs, barnacles and foramnifera at sites such as Pakefield and Happisburgh III [3] but analysis is prevented by the small number of sites and is complicated by the breaching of the Weald-Artois anticline creating the Straits of Dover and by major changes in fluvial geography [120], [28]. There are several reasons why lower reach of river valley floors would have been a favoured habitat in north west Europe including access to water, safety from predators, lowest river crossing points (natural rivers are shallow and frequently anastomose in these reaches facilitating crossing) and food resources. In this paper we have used a database of plant and animals resources known from Pleistocene sites in the region to compile a potential list of nutritional resources. Through ecological classification the nutrient landscape can be estimated and this shows a marked potential locational advantage for floodplain zones as opposed to the forested slopes, plateaus and even clearings. It is argued that this advantage may have included access to plants and animals which provided both essential energy and macronutrients but also critical micronutrients which maintained population health and maximised reproductive success and may have increased cultural complexity [121]. Such Palaeolithic diets with an aquatic component have been implicated in ‘healthy aging’, an emerging concept in evolutionary nutrition which has as its mantra ‘we are what we eat, but we should be what we ate’ [122], [87]. It is possible these locations were perceived as ‘healthy/good places’ to which hominins returned on a regular, and prolonged basis, and may have been ‘marked’ by their assemblage of artefacts [123]. If these were important and revisited locations they provide nodal points in the Palaeolithic geography of north west Europe and support the contention that river valleys provided the nutrient-rich route-ways of exploration and utilization of Palaeolithic landscapes. A possible symbiotic interaction through niche creation on floodplains is postulated between hominins, horses, freshwater fish (particularly eels) and beavers. It is also proposed that this optimal pattern of occupation in the nutritional landscape coupled with low population densities was fundamental to the Palaeolithic diet that was successful in facilitating expansion of hominins outside their evolutionary homelands and the persistent, if episodic, occupation of the less productive higher latitude regions of the northern hemisphere for over half a million years.']"

We have shown that the expression of key genes involved in the two main epigenetic mechanisms (DNA methylation and histone modifications) were significantly altered in the F1 generation, while these changes were not as obvious in the F2 and F3 generations. Moreover, the dietary restriction induced global histone H3 acetylation changes, with the most prominent effect detected in F1. Our study indicated that applied a prenatal restriction diet may induce long-term effects on the epigenome across generations. Future studies are needed to better understand the gene–nutrition interactions.']"

While these results support the argument that MSG is likely to be safe for use in the healthy population, these results also suggest that significant adverse effects may be seen in subjects with genetic susceptibility to diabetes or with a preexisting chronic pancreatitis. We also submit that additional factors not accounted in our experimental design include the individual genetic susceptibility and other nutritional factors which will be the objective of future studies, along with functional studies of islet cells exposed to MSG.']"

Although many consumers were interested in understanding information about foods’ nutrition composition and ingredients, the language and format used in current Brazilian food labels often make such information inaccessible. WLs show potential to support consumers in addressing those barriers and their suggestions for a new label.

Dietary Se deficiency globally down-regulate expression of selenoprotein encoding- and insulin signaling related- genes in pancreas, liver and muscle, resulting in dyslipidemia, hypoinsulinemia and hyperglycemia in chicken. The global changes are likely to be associated with the pancreatic atrophy caused by Se deficiency as well as due to Se deficiency per se.

The BSS may also be used in comparative studies to assess differences in perception of overweight and obesity in native Africans and people of African descent living outside of Africa. Finally, in the context of nutritional transition and the obesity epidemic, the BSS may be used to estimate to what extent the social valorisation of overweight represents a risk factor for obesity and associated metabolic diseases [8, 10].']"

However, further work, including clinical trials, would be required to fully determine a human health outcome.']"

2019-08-05T00:00:00Z,Food-type may jeopardize biomarker interpretation in mussels used in aquatic toxicological experimentation,"['According to the present study, Best Available Practices for biomarker-based toxicological experiments should include the appropriate selection and reporting of the food type and feeding regime to achieve reliable and comparable experimental data on the biological effects of pollutants. Commercial food based on frozen or freeze-dried diets might not be the best option for feeding during toxicological experiments, similar to what was earlier shown for aquaculture production [106,118]. Live commercial phytoplankton might be a viable alternative, yet the dietary microalgae should be selected on the basis of the suitable dimension (size, volume, weight) of algal cells, high digestibility and balanced nutritional value [106]. Furthermore, different live microalgae affect biomarkers in different ways. T. chuii that has low digestibility and long gut retention times [114,117,124] appears to influence nutritional status, oxidative stress and digestion processes in mussels. Alternatively, the massive presence of I. galbana within digestive cells may hamper the measurement of fluorescent-based cytochemical biomarkers and may bias biochemical biomarkers due to the high abundance of the algae in the mussel tissue. Interestingly, at low dietary cell concentrations of I. galbana (2×104 cells/mL) the occurrence of microalgae within digestive cells is negligible [125]; however, rations over 2×104 cells/mL are recommended and commonly used in physiological experiments [36, 126]. Further research is needed to optimize dietary food type, composition, regime and rations for toxicological experimentation. Meanwhile, it is important that research papers include a detailed description of the food type and feeding conditions to aid in comparison and interpretation of the biological responses elicited by pollutants in mussels.']"
2018-04-12T00:00:00Z,"Leg length, skull circumference, and the incidence of dementia in Latin America and China: A 10/66 population-based cohort study","['Our cohort study clarifies the association between markers of early life development; leg length (an inverse association) and skull circumference (no association) and the incidence of dementia in late life. It addresses previous unresolved concerns regarding direction of causality through repeated measures of leg and skull dimensions. Main effects and interactions are estimated with much more power and precision than had been previously possible. Findings from previous studies in high income countries, can now be generalised to diverse urban and rural settings in Latin America and China.Consistent findings across settings and previous studies provide quite strong support for an association between adult leg length and dementia incidence in late-life, with early life nutrition most plausibly implicated as the antecedent cause. While attention has focused upon education as a modifiable risk factor for dementia, much less has been accorded to other developmental factors. Mean male adult height, after a long period of relative stability, has increased by 5-10cms since 1920 in high income countries [38]. This secular trend may, in part, explain recent trends towards a declining incidence of dementia in high income countries, which are not adequately accounted for by improvements in education and cardiovascular risk profile [39–41]. Our findings would predict a 7% reduction in the incidence of dementia with each five centimetre increment in height. Further clarification of these associations could inform predictive models of future incidence, prevalence and numbers affected, and invigorate global efforts to improve childhood nutrition, growth and development.']"

For its nutritional and chemical composition pollen is an ideal matrix for bacterial colonization and growth. Some critical moments in pollen production like the collection and manipulation by beekeepers as well as the storage can favour the spoilage by some microorganisms. Because fresh pollen samples were positive for the presence of some pathogenic species and also levels of MTVC, YM, LAB and Enterobacteriaceae were relevant a high health risk could be associated to the consumption of fresh bee pollen. Same assumptions are also referred to consumption of frozen bee pollen while dried pollen remains the safest form of consumption of this high nutritional value product.Microbiological profile of pollens is a fundamental aspect to guarantee a safe use in human consumption of this product. Many world countries have national standards for pollen, in particular, as reported by Campos et al. [1], pollen standards existed at that time in countries such as Brazil, Bulgaria, Poland and Switzerland, while bee pollen has not to be considered like food supplement within EU but like a standard food, hence subjected to standard food legislation. At best of our knowledge this is the first work conducted in Italy on a comprehensive microbiological evaluation of bee pollen, both in its fresh and processed form.From the results of our analysis it is clear that a more extensive biological hazard analysis should be conducted on bee pollen for human consumption and that biological contamination levels of areas in which hives are positioned should be taken into account from beekeepers.']"

We found nutritional stress, as indexed by low T3 levels, was greatest at high latitude where habitat quality and lichen abundance was low. Given evidence that Western Arctic Herd caribou that overwinter north of their traditional wintering grounds have lower survivorship (Joly, unpublished data), we put forth the hypothesis that relative importance of lichens in the diet of overwintering caribou is related more to adult survivorship than pregnancy and parturition in our study area. This could manifest itself through better body condition to evade predators. Aside from evidence that caribou wintering north of the herd’s core winter range fare poorer, we did not detect robust, widespread indications of winter time malnutrition. Low winter food availability during late gestation could lead to lower neonatal survival [27] and thus recruitment, which has been detected for the Western Arctic Herd [30]. Suboptimal summer range conditions may lead to depressed milk output, less robust calves, less cows being pregnant and lower survival rates. We found slightly lower than expected pregnancy rates and concurrent with high levels of adult cow mortality during summer (June, July, August; Joly, unpublished data). Additionally, poor recruitment of calves has been documented [30]. Reduced reproductive output and recruitment in concert with lower adult survival rates could be facilitating the herd’s decline and should be investigated further before additional development occurs.']"
2017-01-03T00:00:00Z,Nutrition Smoothing: Can Proximity to Towns and Cities Protect Rural Children against Seasonal Variation in Agroclimatic Conditions at Birth?,"['This article exploits temporal and spatial differences in health risks to measure nutrition smoothing, defined here as the ability of a household or community to achieve similar outcomes for children exposed to different seasonal conditions. Our setting is the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), one of the world’s most impoverished countries whose vast expanse straddles the equator, exposing households to differing degrees of seasonal rainfall variation, and whose sparse urbanization and lack of infrastructure gives households very different distances to the nearest towns. In this context, we use naturally occurring randomness in the timing of conception and birth to construct a spatial difference-in-differences test of whether households with easier access to markets and public services can use that to protect their children from seasonal fluctuations in malnutrition and disease. Future work with other kinds of data could address which urban resources confer resilience to which seasonal risks.An important feature of DRC is that children’s average health is not necessarily worst where seasonal variation is most extreme. For example, being geographically isolated could actually benefit households and children, as isolation and rugged terrain may protect them from violence or disease outbreaks in more populated areas [65]. Furthermore, being located near the equator may provide relatively uniform weather which is beneficial for growing crops, but also impose worse disease conditions because there is no interruption to the reproductive cycle of mosquitos [66]. Our research design takes account of these factors, building on the literature described above to isolate seasonal fluctuations from other factors and test for a protective effect of proximity to towns. Distance to urban resources may help explain why we sometimes observe a limited influence of income or wealth on health and nutrition outcomes [67]. As shown in this study, variation in environmental factors over time as well as space plays a relatively large role in those settings than in places with greater access to markets and services. The lack of nutrition smoothing also contributes to the extremely poor average outcomes observed in the DRC [51, 68].Health outcomes in this study are child mortality, heights and weights at the time of the country’s 2007 and 2013 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). Our main result is that households’ proximity to towns and markets does protect children from seasonal fluctuations in health conditions at birth. For child height, the magnitude of gain from having above-median proximity to urban areas is similar in magnitude to the gain from being two quintiles higher in the local wealth distribution. Results of this magnitude are large but plausible, and help explain the rural-urban differences in health outcomes found in a wide variety of other settings. We subjected our findings to a variety of robustness tests, including comparisons of the estimated average treatment effect with similarly estimated coefficients in placebo regions and for placebo outcomes, selection bias in birth timing and child mortality, and other possible threats to identification.Further work such as [69] would be needed to distinguish among the possible causal mechanisms involved, for example to distinguish between the role of private markets and the use of public services, and to identify the role of particular aspects of seasonal variation in dietary intake or disease burdens. Incorporating data on the amenities available in different towns would help distinguish which ones contribute most to nutrition smoothing in surrounding areas. Different mechanisms may be protective against different shocks, but all rely on infrastructure to link rural households with towns and cities where goods are traded and services are provided. These results add a new dimension to the role of rural infrastructure and access to towns. Interventions to lower households’ travel costs could help reduce their vulnerability, in addition to the many well-known investments that target specific causes of malnutrition such as improved diets, health care and reduced disease transmission.']"

In addition to that, the elevated levels of phenolics, flavonoids, and phenolic acid were found in co-cultivated plants with P. indica compared to non-inoculated ones. These findings reveal that treatment with beneficial fungus as bio-fertilizer can be a cost-effective and environmentally-friendlier approach for enhancing the quality and health properties of fresh vegetables, which may act as an alternative to conventional chemical-based strategies. In-depth studies on unraveling the contribution of beneficial fungi and its relationship with different host plants would be important for future sustainable agriculture']"

When designing low cost national food baskets their feasibility and implementation has to be investigated via intervention studies. Feasible food baskets, which are readily accepted by low socioeconomic groups, could serve as the basis for national food based dietary guidelines that can help reduce diet-related health inequalities. National and international authorities could, by using linear programming methods, design dietary guidelines that are more cost-effective in preventing micronutrient deficiencies and diet-related NCDs.']"

Changes in innate immune actors such as iNOS2b, Lysozyme C, and PGRP6 may impact the delicate recognition/tolerance balance for commensal and pathogenic bacteria on the skin and gill. Furthermore, our analysis identified critical regulators of metabolism, cell cycling, and transport previously unstudied and/or unreported in these tissues whose expression was perturbed by fasting. The highlighted expression profiles reveal potential mechanistic similarities between gut and surface mucosa and underscore the complex interrelationships between nutrition, mucosal integrity, and immunity in teleost fish.']"

In all conditions, coral colonies released DOM and POM into the surrounding seawater, thereby providing a source of energy, rich in carbon and nitrogen compounds, to the planktonic communities. The released OM was predominantly composed of DOC and DON, highly stimulating microbial growth and production, as well as the abundances of VLP. It remains a potential target issue of future studies to know if this enhancement of the microbial loop in the vicinity of C. caespitosa may help this species, whose nutrition is based on heterotrophy in winter, to prey on microbes. Nevertheless, OM release acts as a trophic link between corals and the planktonic organisms in the Mediterranean Sea.']"

2016-06-30T00:00:00Z,"Early-Life Events, Including Mode of Delivery and Type of Feeding, Siblings and Gender, Shape the Developing Gut Microbiota","['To our knowledge this is one of the few studies using a statistical model to elucidate the complex process of early life colonization connecting longitudinal data and the different factors influencing this dynamic process. However, whereas currently 16S sequencing is often used to study the composition and diversity of complex microbial ecosystems, we chose to use a qPCR targeted approach, which allowed us to follow quantitatively the colonization of key taxa at species level.This study contributes to understand not only the composition of the microbiota in early life, but also the succession process and the evolution of the microbial community as a function of time and important events or ecological drivers occurring the first 6 months of life.Our results confirm that mode of delivery and type of feeding are important factors influencing this process, providing more detailed information about the timing of this influence and a deeper level of bacterial identification beyond genus. Additionally, this study reveals that other factors, which may have not yet been sufficiently studied or overlooked in the past; including presence of siblings, pets, and gender also influence this process. Even though the difference may be viewed as subtle, we need to further understand the implications of the differential effects observed and the association with potential health outcomes in the future. As expected, known early colonizers such as Bifidobacterium and/or specific Bifidobacterium species, are shown to be greatly influenced by most factors investigated in our study. Surprisingly, some of the known infant type bifidobacterial species, such B. breve and B. longum subsp. infantis were confirmed in this study to be early colonizers but were hardly dependent on the covariates studied. On the contrary, different Lactobacillus species are shown to be influenced by several covariates even though they are not normally dominant in the infant gut. In addition, our results also point out that Bacteroides is a key bacterial genus in the early colonization process, which is influenced by most factors included in the model to a larger extend than Bifidobacterium, which may indicate the need to consider strains belonging to this genus as potential probiotic interventions in infant nutrition in the future.Our results also suggest that there is at least a certain degree of bacterial exposure in utero since 77.08% of the meconium samples contained bacterial DNA.One needs to keep in mind that these results are generated using data driven covariate selection and therefore further studies are warranted to confirm these findings.In summary, this study provides new insights that need to be taken into consideration when selecting the most relevant nutritional supplementation strategies to establish the microbiota composition in early life and potentially influence health later in life. According to our results these strategies may need to differ depending on the timing of supplementation, the environment in which the infant lives and maybe even whether it is a boy or a girl, which seems to point out to the need to develop personalized infant nutrition in the future.']"
2018-03-27T00:00:00Z,"4000 years of human dietary evolution in central Germany, from the first farmers to the first elites","['This study of human diet between the early stages of the farming lifestyle and the Early Bronze Age in the MES, based on carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses, is amongst the most comprehensive of its kind. Or results show that human dietary behaviour has changed significantly throughout the study period. A distinct increase in the proportion of animal protein in the human diet can be identified over time, a trend which only the people from the BBC did not follow. The results of the stable isotope analyses are consistent with epidemiological data on caries frequency, which indicate the highest proportions of carbohydrates in the human diet in the EN and the lowest in the EBA [19]. These findings may have been due to an increased consumption of either meat or dairy products. Although meat and dairy consumption cannot be distinguished by means of stable isotope data or caries frequency, molecular-genetic analyses of lactase persistence argue against an increased consumption of fresh milk [9]. However, although approximately 70% of the world population has a lactose intolerance, most of them can tolerate dairy foods or lactose-containing foods without developing symptoms [128]. It therefore comes as no surprise that the use of processed milk, i.e. dairy products, appears to have set in early on in the Neolithic period [99]. Unarguably, there was an increasing stabilisation of the supply of meat and secondary animal products throughout the Neolithic. The data dynamics overall argue against an equal availability of animal-derived protein to all sections of the various populations, which attests to early processes of specialisation, individualisation and hierarchisation. Moreover, population-genetic processes are also reflected in the development of human dietary habits. From the 4th millennium BC onwards, groups moved into the MES from the north, sometimes accompanied by violence [6,29], and fundamental demographic changes took place in the FN with the arrival of CWC groups from the north-eastern steppes and the BBC from south-western Europe [6,7]. This former pastoral steppe component, in particular, may have been responsible for the fact that animal-based foodstuffs reached their highest importance in the FN and EBA. Differences in the consumption of animal-derived products between the sexes resulted in significantly lower δ15N values and less access to animal protein in females. Besides behavioural choices as to what food to consume, numerous other nutritional and gender-specific factors must certainly be taken into account when assessing the subsistence and nutritional balance of individuals. In the future, analysis of single amino acids of nitrogen and the compound-specific carbon isotope analysis of lipids and bone mineral may help providing more detailed and nuanced insight on aspects of human diet, such as protein sources in complex foodwebs, nutritional stress and disease [129–131]. They should become a standard in isotope studies and applied more often and routinely.']"

SY-V fish now reach the same final body weight as control fish fed the M diet.In the present study, we were able to attribute the better growth performance of the selected line to a higher feed intake. This result confirms that acceptance of a plant-based diet, one of the major steps impeding the total replacement of marine ingredients, can be improved by selection [26]. The reluctance of fish to eat plant-diets remains poorly understood. Hence, the potential to lower sensitivity to plant-diet components through selection, leading to higher feed intake, requires further investigation. The two lines used in this study are a good models to work on.Aside from feed intake, the selection had a limited effect on other nutritional traits in comparison with the diet effect. But the effect of the selection will increase with generations of selection, while the dietary effect should remain stable. It is therefore essential to carefully monitor its consequences such as the EPA/DHA biosynthesis capacity, but also its consequences on traits which were affected by the selection only when fish were fed the M diet (protein retention and starch digestibility).Finally, the feed intake of the selected line was improved similarly when fish were fed the M or the V diets. Our study did not allow us to identify a specific nutritional trait that was significantly improved when fish were fed the V diet only, which could explain the higher genetic gain recorded for those fish. Other traits such as the immune parameters or the microbiota should also be explored in future generations as they are also known to influence the performance of fish fed a plant-based diet.']"
2018-07-03T00:00:00Z,Factors associated with wasting among children under five years old in South Asia: Implications for action,"['South Asia has been home to the largest proportion and number of wasted children in the world for decades [14]. This requires quick and substantial reductions if the region is to achieve global targets to which its governments have committed to. South Asian countries need to focus on programs targeting the first 1,000 days, for instance taking into consideration the preconception period and expecting mothers with low BMI. As demonstrated in this analysis, there are country-specific venerable subgroups that countries can focus on to improve national outcomes and reduce inequities across the country.As argued by WHO (2014), targets to reduce wasting can only be achieved if “high-burden countries take stock of their current prevalence, projected population growth, underlying causes of wasting and the resources available to address them; set target annual reduction rates to guide intervention efforts; mobilize necessary resources; and develop and implement systematic plans for the reduction of wasting” [17]. Using data for child anthropometry from 121 surveys in 36 low-income and middle-income countries, Vollmer et al. (2014) showed that “macroeconomic growth has a null to quantitatively very weak association with reductions in…wasting” [43]. In other words, waiting for economic growth to take care of this significant problem is simply not a viable policy option.This study highlights the scale of wasting in South Asia, and its several links to stunting. We note that the underlying determinants of wasting and stunting are similar. With well-known and cost-effective interventions to prevent stunting and manage wasting, the raising number of wasted children is unacceptable. Policymakers and program designers should broaden their perspectives on nutrition interventions to ensure that investments aimed at addressing single nutrition condition (like stunting) are tailored in ways that will also contribute to tackling wasting. Separating these two manifestations of undernutrition in conceptual and programmatic terms is unnecessarily impairing progress on both fronts.']"

In the LA sub-group, patients with high faecal D/L lactate ratio and low plasma HCO3− value were at risk to develop recurrent D-encephalopathy episodes.

Stretched human resources and stockouts of medicines, nutritional therapeutics, and laboratory supplies were the most commonly reported barriers to guideline implementation. Clinical staffing benchmarks at the facility-level would greatly enhance quality assessment and improvement efforts. Finally, health worker time requirements should be assessed when testing implementation of novel inpatient diagnostics and treatments, as it may be a critical determinant of effectiveness outside of clinical trial conditions.']"
2017-04-05T00:00:00Z,High dietary selenium intake is associated with less insulin resistance in the Newfoundland population,"['In conclusion, our findings revealed a significantly negative association of dietary Se intake with insulin resistance in the large CODING study with many major confounding factors adjusted, when dietary Se intake was below 1.6 μg/kg/day. Given the narrow margin between Se deficiency, adequacy, over-nutrition and toxicity, accurately determining this cutoff point is clinically important. People with an adequate or high Se status have already received the maximum benefit from Se and need not take additional Se supplementation, because of the potential risks, such as the increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Ultimately, this study aims to add to our present knowledge about the optimal constitution of an ideal diet to reduce insulin resistance and risk of type 2 diabetes in terms of specific macronutrient and micronutrient composition.']"
2015-09-25T00:00:00Z,Breastfeeding and IQ Growth from Toddlerhood through Adolescence,"['In a large sample of British children from TEDS, girls who had been breastfed had a slight advantage in early life cognitive ability after adjusting for covariates; however, the effect was statistically very weak and not significant in boys. Furthermore, breastfeeding was not associated with IQ gains from early life through adolescence for both boys and girls. One might understand these findings to support the notion that breastfeeding has nutritional benefits for intelligence in the first few years of life given that breastfeeding was slightly associated with early life intelligence but not with later cognitive growth. However because the observed effects were weak and at best modest, we interpret the findings as evidence for the lack of any benefits of breastfeeding on cognitive development from early life through adolescence.']"
2013-12-04T00:00:00Z,Bacterial Endosymbiosis in a Chordate Host: Long-Term Co-Evolution and Conservation of Secondary Metabolism,"['While the progress of genome decay in intracellular symbionts is most well studied in insects, our results show that such phenomena are not limited to this group of hosts. Insect symbionts most often provide nutritional support by synthesizing essential nutrients not found in the insect’s diet, and are sometimes found to be protective against parasites or infection [1]–[3]. The symbiotic relationship of Ca. E. faulkneri and L. patella is instead based on the production of relatively large natural products, and our analysis suggests that these products have been important enough to be conserved against a drive of genome reduction for millions of years. Evidence of such a stable symbiotic relationship cements the role of symbiotic bacteria in natural product production [61], [62], and suggests that intracellular symbionts may be an important source of natural products.']"

The effects of exposure of the fish to a HFD on the expression levels of miRNAs and their predicted lipid metabolism-related target genes were characterized. In addition, the potential downstream GO categories and KEGG pathways of the target genes were determined. The results suggest that four verified miRNAs and six putative target genes play important roles in hepatic steatosis in blunt snout bream. The results presented here are a foundation for future studies aimed at identifying potential pharmaceutical and nutritional targets in blunt snout bream. Additional in vivo and in vitro investigations are required to gain a complete understanding of the association between miRNA profiles, target genes, and the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis in this species.']"
2013-12-05T00:00:00Z,Impact of Early Colonizers on In Vitro Subgingival Biofilm Formation,"['Biofilms inoculated without S. oralis, S. anginosus, and A. oris developed the same total counts as biofilms inoculated with these in vivo early colonizers. Interestingly, the physical resilience of the biofilms without the early colonizers was the same as well. Nevertheless, the absence of early colonizers led to a significant increase in P. intermedia cell numbers, along with a significant decrease of P. gingivalis. This effect is more likely caused by a synergy between streptococci and P. gingivalis, than by a nutritional competition between P. intermedia and P. gingivalis. Hence, streptococci might possibly facilitate the establishment of P. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms. Without early colonizers being inoculated the biofilm structure appeared looser and P. intermedia became the most dominant species in the biofilms, appearing in the form of long chains of cocci that morphologically resembled the absent streptococci.']"

However, we also observed positive, but unexpected and difficult to explain, changes in the wait-list control group. Therefore, comparative lifestyle benefits for the intervention group may have been masked by undetectable weight management behaviour in the control group. When considered alongside the difficulties faced with recruitment and retention, especially in the nature of the control group, these results provide a challenge for prospective study designs with young women with cardiometabolic risk factors. Traditional RCT designs may be problematic for healthy lifestyle interventions in young women.']"

In the present study, MiP and malaria infection during infancy were independently associated with a substantial reduction in infant Hb during the first year of life. Low maternal BMI at the beginning of pregnancy was also related to a decrease in infants' Hb. Strategies to prevent anaemia in infants should as well integrate measures during pregnancy such as the prevention of MiP and the improvement of maternal nutritional status. IPTp and the use of bed nets by both mothers and infants should be reinforced. Micronutrient supplementation should also be implemented in women of childbearing age and pregnant women but with a lot of caution in a context of malaria-iron interactions where the protection of iron deficiency against malaria is still a controversial issue [40,41].""]"
2014-10-01T00:00:00Z,New Starch Phenotypes Produced by TILLING in Barley,"['TILLING of five genes encoding enzymes involved in starch metabolism enabled us to identify seven new alleles that are associated with new starch phenotypes in terms of amylose/amylopectin ratio, or crystal packing, or distribution of A- and B-granules, or size of A-granules (Table 1). Our results confirmed the role played by granule-bound starch synthase (GBSSI) in controlling amylose biosynthesis and, conversely, the role played by soluble starch synthase IIa (SSIIa) in controlling amylopectin synthesis. Starch granule initiation appeared to be controlled by limit dextrinase (LDA1), and size of A-granules by starch synthases IIa. Thanks to their physical-chemical properties, these new alleles deserve further attention in order to investigate their possible interest in nutritional uses or industrial applications.']"

Further investigations will be important for understanding how abundant microbial taxa such as Parabacteroides may respond to exercise and, in turn, positively influence the metabolic abilities and performance of athletes. The aforementioned results also provide opportunities for researchers to generate interesting hypotheses, such as if the gut microbiota characteristics in humans can be applied to predict athletic performance. If so, multiple methods can be used, such as intense training, sports nutrition intake and even probiotics, to modify the gut microbiota to improve athletic performance.']"

Unlike conventional chemotherapeutics, MEAD is observed to exert only mild to moderate beneficial effects against MCF7 cells. Purification of MEAD and the identification of individual components that are responsible for anti-cancer properties will pave way for the development of novel anticancer therapeutics. In addition, the aglycone metabolites of Ajwa dates such as Luteolin, myricetin, apigenin, quercetin and petunidin have been reported to induce apoptosis in cancers [41–44].

The dietary pattern characterized by frequent pizza and pasta consumption (>2 times per week) was associated with a higher lycopene intake and higher lycopene plasma concentration, but it was also high in energy, SFA, trans-FA and sodium intakes. Thus, a diet with a frequent pizza and pasta intake presents a nutrient profile inconsistent with dietary recommendations that aim to reduce chronic disease risk in middle-aged and older adults at high risk of chronic diseases living in the Southeastern USA. Future studies of lycopene as a protective dietary factor against chronic disease should consider the overall nutritional quality of lycopene-containing foods.']"

An online transcriptomic database containing many transcripts and detailed annotations has also been established. Our research indicated that the capacity for protein digestion and amino acid absorption may be most important in eel larvae. The capacity for carbohydrate and lipid digestion may be poor in the preleptocephali stage. The nutritional requirements of monosaccharides and lipids appeared to increase as larvae grow. Moreover, at the glass eel stage, the absorption of amino acids may arise from the need to produce strong muscles and sufficient energy to migrate to the rivers. In the future, more detailed information, such as what kinds of amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, and microelements can be greatly utilized by eel larvae, shall need to be further clarified.']"

It is suggested that organophosphate insecticides can increase the risk of diabetes mellitus. We propose that prebiotics, which have the ability to alter the microbiota in a positive manner, is a safe and cost-effective nutritional strategy to counteract CPF insulin resistance and diabetes in later life. Human clinical trials should be undertaken to confirm these effects. However, additional basic research is necessary to better understand the crosstalk between microbiota and the host in order to elucidate the exact mechanism by which, microbiota alleviates the metabolic defects induced by CPF in adults. Experiments are in progress to determine whether the gut/brain axis is also involved in such regulation.']"

Also, nutritional habits and hydration of cavers were assessed, revealing interesting details that will be useful in defining an ideal diet for this special type of physical activity that requires a protracted, although moderately intense, exercise under singular environmental conditions. Since the scientific literature on caving is scarce, its distinguishing characteristics call for more research to better determine the physiological basis of this activity in a variety of settings and for multiple purposes. From a methodological point of view, we have shown the usefulness and suitability of bioimpedance vector analysis to evaluate body composition variations in subjects performing physical activity in extreme environments, such as those related to cave exploration.']"

Enzyme assays showed MtAAE3 encodes an oxalyl-CoA that is capable of catalyzing the first step in the degradation of oxalate to CO2. Expression of this enzyme was also found to be inducible by the substrate, oxalate. This enzyme appears to be essential in the degradation of oxalate whether from an endogenous or exogenous source. The ability to degrade endogenous oxalate was found to be important in the regulation of druse crystal accumulation while the ability to degrade exogenous oxalate was shown to be important in defense against oxalate-secreting phytopathogens. Because of these two functional roles further study of AAE3 and remaining steps of this CoA-dependent pathway of oxalate degradation could lead to the development of new strategies to improve the nutrition quality and production of crops.']"

Nutrition education for disease prevention should promote bean consumption as part of a healthy lifestyle that fits with cultural traditions among Latino groups. Promotion of cultural practices may make recommendations more salient and achievable for immigrants, especially those with limited resources. Culturally appropriate health messages are essential and cannot be derived from national survey data alone. Our findings aid in the development of culturally tailored messages for the retention or increase of bean consumption in traditional and mainstream diets for disease prevention among limited resource Hispanic women living in the southwest US. These lessons can also be translated to other settings to improve health.']"

During the cheliped regeneration process, crabs could accelerate bud growth by increasing the crude protein content, promote regeneration rate and shorten molting cycle by up-regulating the positive growth-related gene and down-regulating the molting inhibition gene, and accelerate nutrient metabolism such as lipid metabolism and tryptophan metabolism. Our study found that the molting of crabs in the autotomy group was earlier than in control group. In order to promote the cheliped regeneration and molting, we recommend that we should enhance the hepatopancreas total lipid content, strengthen the nutrition of fatty acids such as MUFA and DHA and supply appropriate amounts of L-tryptophan to the diet, which will help to promote cheliped regeneration and improve survival rate after molting.']"

This report is useful for authors, grant claimants, funding organizations, and policy makers. It could be also used for future research on burden of this disease which is important for medical education and policy making. The health care system needs national and subnational estimates of disease mortality to establish health development programs. Cirrhosis mortality could be diminished by using new non-invasive methods of cirrhosis screening, hepatitis B vaccination, curable treatment of hepatitis C, and reducing obesity via designing nutritional policies and programs at national and subnational levels particularly in high risk groups.']"

Gene expression in the GALT of PM-fed chickens was significantly enriched with immune-related pathways, in particular ISGs, other components of the innate immune response, regulation of cytokine production and regulation of B cell activation and proliferation. The microbiota of PM-fed chickens was significantly more diverse than control chickens, and appears to be effected by prebiotics in pigeon ‘milk’, as well as being directly seeded by bacteria present in PM. Taken together, these results suggest that PM is more functionally similar to mammalian milk than was previously thought. PM and mammalian milk both have nutritional and immune modulatory components, and the ability to modulate the microbiota of the gut. This is fascinating from an evolutionary point of view when one considers that mammals and birds evolved these processes independently.']"

Furthermore, successive changes to the nutrient databases used for the 24HR data-to-energy conversations and improvements in measurement protocols make it exceedingly difficult to discern temporal patterns in caloric intake that can be related to changes in population rates of obesity. As such, there are no valid population-level data to support speculations regarding trends in caloric consumption and the etiology of the obesity epidemic. Because under-reporting and physiologically implausible rEI values are a predominant feature of U.S. nutritional surveillance, the ability to generate empirically supported public policy and dietary guidelines relevant to the obesity epidemic based on these data is extremely limited.']"

The CHC exposure effects on nymph selfishness and maternal reproductive physiology both depend on the timing of breeding. Although the ultimate causes of this variation remain to be illuminated, our findings that behavioral consequences of information exchange depend on the timing of breeding suggest that adaptive responses in communication can be strongly context-dependent and include responses that are in opposite direction.']"

The results suggest that the promotion of breastfeeding might help to reduce the prevalence of obesity among children, even though it may be of minor importance compared to public health interventions related to physical activity, healthy food choices and the underlying social, economic and cultural factors. Like the majority of previous studies, which reported heterogeneous results, our analyses rely on observational data. Even though we tried to minimize potential confounding by using propensity score methods and by considering a rich set of covariates, we have to remain cautious when interpreting the evidence on the beneficial effects of breastfeeding to inform public health interventions and guidelines on infant nutrition.']"

From functional analyses, sow folate deficiency affected almost all biological processes in the progeny. Three affected molecular pathways, including metabolic pathways, muscle development pathways and lipid metabolism pathways, were identified. Lipid metabolism-related genes and associated metabolic pathways in piglets were extensively regulated by folate deficiency of the pregnant sow, especially in the LR♂ × LW♀ cross. This study provides evidence that sow folate nutrition affects skeletal muscle transcriptome of the offspring, which is likely caused by altering epigenetic modifications.']"

Our study results are applicable to hospitalized patients. Further, a retrospective cohort study design led to higher rates of missingness amongst many key variables. We therefore recommend that future studies focus on prospectively assessing nutritional status, measuring weight gain, and ensuring proper DM diagnosis for all included patients. We would also encourage a longitudinal study observing both out-patients and in-patients. This would permit for a more comprehensive analysis of TB-DM and ensure targeted solutions.']"
2018-07-10T00:00:00Z,Effect of cowpea flour processing on the chemical properties and acceptability of a novel cowpea blended maize porridge,"['We have shown that a novel complementary food made by fortification of whole maize flour with three different forms of processed cowpea flours are acceptable by children and their caregivers in rural Malawi. These processing methods also produced flours that retained low moisture content and stable-to-improved zinc, crude fibre, and flavonoid content. Cowpea flour is thus a potential complementary food intervention that could be used towards mitigating stunting and EED in this high-risk population, especially since cowpea is available in Malawi and not entirely unfamiliar to the population. Given the relative simplicity in preparing the roasted cowpea flour and its equivalent nutritional content and acceptability, this novel formulation of complementary food was tested in two prospective, randomized clinical trials among four populations of rural Malawian children [39].']"
2015-03-17T00:00:00Z,Transcriptomic Signatures in Seeds of Apple (Malus domestica L. Borkh) during Fruitlet Abscission,"['Our seed transcriptomic data suggest that lateral fruits are ‘pre-conditioned’ to abscise, and that the effect of blooming time and fertilization as well as position inside the corymb are important for conditioning the transcriptome of the seed, leading to specific features that will ultimately decide the fate of the fruitlet according to the nutritional conditions of the plant. These seeds are thus ‘prepared’ for the stimulus and rapidly respond to it by triggering the hormonal response leading to developmental arrest. We cannot exclude the influence of developmental stage between central and lateral fruits in the differences observed. The latter are younger and this might explain some of the differences in the expression levels of the genes tested. Nevertheless, this is the physiological situation inside the corymb. Central fruit fertilization and set can condition the lateral fruits, which physiologically will have reduced PAT and more ethylene. From our results, we can suggest that most of the lateral fruits are already conditioned to abscise. This conditioning could putatively be a protection mechanism to save the most adapted fruit, the central fruits, in case of nutritional or environmental stress. Seeds from lateral fruits seem to be activating a mechanism to maintain homeostasis and avoid abscission, and eventually, depending on their position in the cluster, they may be unable to avoid triggering the signal that will lead to developmental arrest and eventually abscission. As regards the abscission process, seeds would play a role in stopping physiological shedding. It remains to be elucidated whether they, or the cortex as has been previously proposed [3], are also the primary sensors of the abscission signal as we cannot exclude the possibility of the seed-specific early peak of ethylene biosynthesis being the signal for developmental arrest. In order to establish a more precise model and identify the abscission signal trigger, further studies are necessary to determine both the nature of the hormonal signalling before 15 DAPF in these fruits and the cross-talk between the cortex and the seed. Nevertheless, our study represents an important step for elucidating the biological pathways involved in young fruit abscission, and more studies are being conducted to unravel new genes and functions involved in this process.']"
2017-11-09T00:00:00Z,Challenges and opportunities for Moringa growers in southern Ethiopia and Kenya,"['Ethiopia and Kenya are among the countries where hidden hunger is widespread. The survey reported here has generated useful information on human dietary usage and other common uses of MO and MS by communities in southern Ethiopia and Kenya. The participating MGH include subsistence farmers, most likely to be affected by hidden hunger and thus benefit from a perennial, drought resilient food plant. Where Moringa growers in these countries use MO or MS edible parts in their diet, this is likely to contribute to better mineral nutrition of the consumers. There are differences between regions in how Moringa is typically used, and which parts of the plant are consumed in meals, suggesting opportunities exist to learn more from these varying uses, which could influence any extension work. This could also help to understand why some MGH in Kenya choose not to eat Moringa.We found a high level of awareness of multiple roles of Moringa among MGHs, although as with diets, these reported uses varied between regions. The presence of MGHs with Moringa saplings of one year or less indicates that the cultivation of Moringa is expanding. We have also documented some of the potential barriers to further widening use of these species, according to current growers. These particularly relate to: increasing evidence as to the benefits of Moringa products; pest/disease control; and, access to secure markets.The perennial nature, multiple uses, and resilience to drought of Moringa species make them a suitable target for more agro-silvicultural, nutritional, and pharmacological research. A comprehensive, integrated and multidisciplinary research effort, and links with development and extension agents are required on these multipurpose tree species to develop them not only as crops to contribute to the alleviation of hidden hunger, but to potentially develop a commodity crop that can improve some of the multifaceted socioeconomic problems in tropical and subtropical developing countries. Although the multiple uses and services that can be derived from Moringa spp. are opportunities, maximization of the potential benefits requires research, extension and developmental priority setting in consultation with the stakeholders to better understand their viability.']"
2013-05-29T00:00:00Z,"Decomposing the Gap in Childhood Undernutrition between Poor and Non–Poor in Urban India, 2005–06","[""It is an accepted fact that rapid urbanization in India is characterized by a growing poor/non-poor divide in health and utilization of MCH services. The main findings from this analysis build a strong case for multipronged policies specifically targeted to improve the health of urban areas by reducing the gap between poor and non-poor. The result of the decomposition analysis clearly shows that the children belonging to poor households are undernourished not only because of poverty, but also due to limited use of maternal health care services and poor care resulting from lower educational status of parents and poor health of mothers. If policy makers want to reduce the gap in childhood undernutrition between the urban poor and the non-poor, the problem of low use of public services, such as antenatal checkups, full immunization coverage, and mother's education should be addressed among the urban poor. It may improve the nutritional status of poor children by ameliorating the negative impacts of poverty and could reduce the gap in childhood undernutrition between urban poor and non-poor in the country. Since, formal schooling offers a long-term solution, because there are long lags between the time when girls join primary school and the time they become mothers, an intermediate solution would be to focus on literacy training for older women [66]. Improving the ways health care systems effectively interact with illiterate mothers is another possible option that can be considered [41].The findings of the study prioritize the need of the recently drafted National Urban Health Mission (NUHM). A major mandate of NUHM is to improve the health of the urban poor, particularly among slum dwellers and other disadvantaged sections, by enhancing equitable access to quality healthcare [9]. The NUHM should also address issues of mother's health, particularly of pregnant women to minimize the intergenerational transmission of undernutrition. These findings are not only applicable for reducing the poor/non-poor gap in childhood undernutrition, but also contribute to reducing the overall burden of childhood undernutrition (particularly of underweight and stunting) in urban India. In addition to targeting the urban poor, there is the need of a comprehensive nutritional strategy to reduce the burden of childhood undernutrition in urban India.\nLimitations of the study\nA few limitations need to be considered while interpreting the result of the study. First, we have not considered twin children in the study. This could have affected the results slightly as twins are considered to be generally more vulnerable to poor nutrition and health, especially those born in poor households. Second, this study could not assess the contribution due to differences in access to (physical distance) and quality of the health care services availed by poor and non-poor population in urban India because variables capturing such characteristics were not available in the dataset used for the analysis. Third, this study examined the effects of only those variables which were measured in the survey, but the poor/non-poor gap in childhood undernutrition is also likely to be affected by the variation in unmeasured sources such as disease exposure, food intake etc, which were not captured. Finally, there may be state wise variations in factors affecting childhood undernutrition in urban areas which need further investigations.\n""]"
2017-01-12T00:00:00Z,Bacterial Communities Associated with Houseflies (Musca domestica L.) Sampled within and between Farms,"['The microbiota of arthropods plays an important role in host nutrition and can influence the transmission of vector borne pathogens. In the present study we have for the first time examined the microbiota of adult Musca domestica from different geographical farms with similar farming practice and manure management. Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of individual flies and on the entire fly microbiota revealed a highly diverse microbiota compared to other arthropods. Interestingly, the approach of investigating individual flies shows that most variation was found between individuals within locations and with smaller differences between locations for both richness and diversity. We recommend that the large variation in the housefly microbiota found under natural conditions should be taken into consideration when trying to establish the vector competence of bacteria for insect species, but also in epidemiological studies addressing the spread and distribution of pathogens by vector species.']"

Flavonoids in nine tissues were studied, and we found that lotus leaves possessed the highest amount of flavonoids, followed by flower petals, lotus plumules and stamens. Moreover, we determined the optimum harvest time for vegetable, tea or medicinal purposes. Overall, thirty-three flavonoids were identified, in which eleven C-glycosides and five O-glycosides were detected for the first time in lotus tissues. The detection of plentiful C-glycosyl flavonoids has enhanced our understanding of flavonoid biosynthesis in lotus. These findings demonstrate the importance of further study of flavonoid C-glycosides because of their wide range of biological activities that could prove vital in the use of lotus plumules for medical and nutritional applications.']"

Thus it is important to not only focus on underweight women but also on overweight/obese women for micronutrient deficiency prevention programs, even in higher socioeconomic strata. Improving micronutrient status of overweight/obese women is particularly important because micronutrient deficiencies may increase chronic disease risk. The findings of this study highlight the importance of targeting interventions to improve micronutrient status for whole populations, and not restrict those to populations selected on basis of specific nutritional status only (such as low BMI).Given the demonstrated health and economic costs of micronutrient deficiencies and obesity, heart disease and diabetes, it is urgent that national interventions and policies address both the trend towards increasing overweight/obesity and the on-going problem of micronutrient deficiencies in Vietnam.']"

Although there is considerable evidence that breastfeeding may mitigate the adverse metabolic effects of obesity and diabetes on both mother and child [49] and had beneficial effects for the offspring in both lean and obese women, we should turn our attention to maternal obesity and overnutrition during pregnancy and lactation on their child. Because our data demonstrated here using the rodent and the diet with very high contents of fat (62% kcal from fat) might be different from the situation in human, further analysis will be required to investigate the significance of the diet during pregnancy and lactation in metabolic effects on both mother and child based on the data using the rodent.']"

The anti-platelet effects of catechol are related to its inhibition of platelet COX activity, TXA2 production, ROS production as well as ERK/p38 signaling. The anti-platelet effect of catechol was confirmed using an ex vivo study. Catechol further suppresses PMA-induced ROS production in PMNs, which is suggestive of possible anti-inflammatory properties. Catechol also exhibits anti-inflammatory effects via inhibition of COX-2 activity and IL-1β-induced prostaglandin production. Catechol showed little cytotoxicity at concentrations below 0.1 mM. Taken together, exposure to catechol or suitable consumption of catechol-containing food/nutritional supplements, such as marine algae tablets or plants, may be beneficial to cardiovascular health.

Postoperative length of stay in elderly cancer patients is mainly influenced by pre-operative nutritional, cognitive and functional state, magnitude of surgery, length of general anesthesia, as well as postoperative complications. Patient empowerment can enhance quality of care in regards to pain, and since over-treatment of pain is particularly harmful for elderly patients, patient safely can thus be improved. Pre-operative information was received well by patients who were cognitively and physically fit.Pre-operative comprehensive geriatric assessment might be beneficial for this high-risk patient group, helping to provide a tailored perioperative management aimed at reducing cognitive and physical barriers, and ultimately improving postoperative outcome.']"

To improve pregnancy outcomes, the following interventions are needed. Firstly, healthcare providers should carry out health education to raise the public awareness of the risks of maternal pre-pregnancy obesity, central adiposity and weight gain during pregnancy on mothers and their infants. Secondly, women should be guided to keep an ideal BMI and WC prior to pregnancy, to gain optimal weight during pregnancy and to return to a healthy BMI and WC within a reasonable amount of time before the second pregnancy. Last but not least, offering women of childbearing age clinical guidelines on nutrition, diet, physical activity, weight and waist circumference management, as well as emphasizing the importance of self-monitoring.']"
2013-03-26T00:00:00Z,Functional Monoecy Due to Delayed Anther Dehiscence: A Novel Mechanism in Pseuduvaria mulgraveana (Annonaceae),"['This study documents the floral phenology and pollination biology of P. mulgraveana in its natural range in northeastern Queensland, Australia. Empirical studies and field surveys reveal that it is andromonoecious, with hermaphroditic and staminate flowers co-occurring within individuals. Both floral morphs were shown to produce viable pollen grains, contradicting the prevailing hypothesis that the stamens of structurally hermaphroditic flowers are sterile. A novel mechanism to promote xenogamy is reported. The structurally hermaphroditic flowers of P. mulgraveana exhibit delayed anther dehisce, with pollen only released after petal abscission once the pollinators have departed. Although structurally hermaphroditic, these flowers are therefore functionally pistillate, and effectively promote xenogamy by precluding autogamy and limiting geitonogamy. In contrast with previous studies of other species in the genus, P. mulgraveana was shown to be beetle-pollinated, with petal tissue and nectar provided as nutritive rewards to the pollinators.']"
2019-05-16T00:00:00Z,Effect of partial substitution of rice with sorghum and inclusion of hydrolyzable tannins on digestibility and postprandial glycemia in adult dogs,"['The inclusion of tannins in canine diets did not affect the voluntary consumption of food by dogs. However, the presence of sorghum caused a reduction in the digestibility of DM, OM, CP, DE, and ME, and promoted greater fecal production. The fecal score was kept in good standard. There was a darkening of feces and urine of the dogs that received sorghum and HT in the diet, strongly indicating that there is metabolism and excretion of its constituents. The addition of HT reduced DM and water content in feces. Although the expected glycemic response results were not observed, sorghum-containing tannins may replace part of rice in canine diets. It brings some consequences like reducing ME content and digestible protein of the diets and may be used as an ingredient to reduce ME in diets restricted in energy, but the content of digestible protein must be compensated by other ingredients. Hydrolysable tannins seems like to potentialize CT effects, but more studies are needed to define what role HT may play on dogs nutrition.']"

Female longevity was more significantly decreased compared to that of males at concentrations of 0.75M and above. Actively mating males and females had decreased longevity compared to virgin males and females at concentrations of 1 M and above. Mannitol fed to larvae did not alter adult sex ratios, suggesting that sex-biased mortality due to mannitol occurs only in adults. Overall, our results support our hypothesis that sex differences in energy needs, related to the nutritional and behavioral demands of mating and reproduction, contribute to decreased longevity in females compared to males. We further conclude that both males and females have mannitol-induced decreases in longevity when mated, as compared to virgins, due to the increased costs of reproduction for both sexes.']"

This study identified 15 proteins involved with various biological functions, including antimicrobial activity, gelling characteristics, immune responses, inhibition of protein precipitation, protease inhibition, and metal ion binding or transport, that may play an important role in albumen quality reduction in the CSM100 group. The decrease in egg white proteins was induced by lower tubular gland and epithelial cell growth of the oviduct magnum when hens were fed a CSM100 diet.

Ensuring timely and adequate payment could improve food security, and augment the protective effect of the MGNREGA. Factors such as lack of mothers’ knowledge about feeding and cultural practices related to inappropriate feeding are important risk factors of infant malnutrition. Identifying and addressing such factors, over and above the social and economic policies, is key in efforts to reduce malnutrition among infants. Therefore, policies need to focus on these factors and target the persistent problem of malnutrition prevalent in India through a convergence of development, health and nutrition policies and programmes.']"
2017-05-01T00:00:00Z,Effect of processing on composition changes of selected spices,"['In general, nutrient true retentions for the five selected spices were explored using seven different cooking procedures. Different true retentions are probably due to food types, the cooking procedures, and interactions between the two. The major observation regarding nutrient true retention was that deep-frying and stir-frying better retained nutrients and steaming showed lower true retention values for selected spices (i.e., crown daisy, unripe hot pepper, onion, garlic, and red pepper). As different culinary treatments have different effects on particular vegetable, the use of suitable cooking methods could enhance the nutrition values of cooked foods and improve overall acceptability. More investigations on the spices from different locations and harvested at different times are necessary. Also, further studies will be undertaken to comprehensively elaborate the true retention of different nutrients of spices with other ingredients.']"

Poisson regression analysis showed a statistically significant decline in the incidence of NCC cases from 2003 to 2015. This result is very interesting and is probably due to improvement of health facilities like hand washing and construction of toilets in schools and houses; Nonetheless implementation of the School Health Nutrition Program by the Child Health Division, under the Department of Health Services of Ministry of Health and Population was probably very important and should be further evaluated together with improved health education and sanitary infrastructure, which might have also contributed to the reduction in the incidence of NCC in children in Nepal.']"

All species demonstrated potential for this purpose, producing less CH4 than DCS. Dictyota and Asparagopsis were the most promising species reducing CH4 output by 92.2% and 98.9% respectively, after 72 h incubation. However, these species also affected fermentation, decreasing the total VFA concentration. Due to their effectiveness, it is likely that lower concentration can inhibit CH4 production and minimize their effects on anaerobic fermentation. In contrast, other species, in particular freshwater macroalgae, may decrease methane output at higher doses and maintain nutritional equivalency to traditional feed components. Further, studies are under way to identify the optimum concentration and algae combinations that will reduce CH4 without affecting fermentation and eventually evaluate the reduction of enteric methane by macroalgae in vivo.']"

Urinary creatinine concentration is a useful tool, easy to apply routinely. Reference values provided by age, gender, and GFR level might help clinicians to identify individuals who may need both special interventions, including nutritional or exercise advice, and monitoring of their response to these interventions.

Our results also confirm that the uptake of n3LC in body and testes tissues was directly influenced by the manipulation of PUFAs in the experimental diets. We strongly advocate further experiments that manipulate omega-3/omega-6 ratios (e.g. [116], [117]) and explore the interactive effects of PUFAs with other dietary resources such as carotenoids [109], [118], essential amino acids [119], [120], and vitamin A or E [102], [121].

There was a large discrepancy between the rates of pre-pregnancy underweight (5.9%) and low average WWG (71.8%), suggesting that factors other than lack of food contributes to low WWG. Therefore, programs should aim at investigating other underlying factors such as maternal infections during pregnancy that may impair appetite. Nevertheless, linear associations between pre-pregnancy BMI and birth weight and child head circumference, and increased risk of stunting among women with low pre-pregnancy BMI suggest that the importance of adequate nutrition in the pre-pregnancy period shouldn’t be overlooked.']"

We cannot distinguish if the effect at the transcriptional level is due to the nutritional composition of eggs (oocytes), maternal mRNA deposition or progeny transcriptome potential through programming of the gametes. Modulation of the transcriptome at early life stages can in turn affect metabolic pathways and their activity at later life stages. To our knowledge, the present study is the first one investigating liver transcriptome characteristics of adult zebrafish progeny from parents fed high ARA levels. Nevertheless, further study is required to understand deeper mechanisms on how those gene expression differences observed in adult progeny develop and if these effects can be transferred to future generations.']"
2012-07-03T00:00:00Z,The Impact of Transnational “Big Food” Companies on the South: A View from Brazil,"['This essay is based on our experience in Brazil, a large country that, together with many other countries in the South, still retains its long-established food systems and thus dietary patterns. By contrast, the traditional food systems of fully industrialized high-income countries like the US and the UK were largely displaced generations ago.As a result, the views of many commentators and policy-makers in the South are in sharp contrast with their counterparts in the North. In countries like the US, the general tendency is to deal with food, nutrition, and public health in isolation as matters largely of information, education, and “individual lifestyle adjustments” designed to reduce the risk of various disabilities and diseases. But in Brazil and other countries in the South, food is seen by most independent scholars and policy-makers as part of a much broader discourse that involves general well-being, the family, friendship, commensality, culture, sustainable livelihoods, environmental preservation, national identity and sovereignty, as well as personal and public health.In the North, the prevailing political and economic ideology, which has developed rapidly since the 1980s, has involved abandonment by governments of policies and actions designed to protect public health and public goods to private corporations. During this process of privatization and globalization, leading corporations have become transnationals.Governments and other powerful and influential institutions, and also research and public health institutions, now need to examine and document the impact on the South of Big Food and Big Snack and their associated and supportive international financial and economic organizations on public health, and also on regional and national nature and culture, independence, and identity. This work must not inhibit the implementation of policies and actions that are needed now; importantly, once enacted, the impact of these essential policies and actions needs to be carefully monitored.Brazil is one of the leading countries in the South. It has substantial remaining natural resources, and its governments at federal, state, and municipal levels remain able to govern. We propose, therefore, that the Brazilian experience provides a basis for the design of rational, comprehensive, and effective public health policies and actions designed to protect and promote nutrition in all its senses.']"

Given that the site has a large user population spread across the country and there are known links between food consumption and obesity incidence, the interaction data might be useful in providing readily accessible and up-to-date information on obesity incidence.\nFindings\nOur findings can be summarised as follows:\n\n\nWe demonstrate significant and meaningful (i.e. sensibly interpretable) relationships between the nutritional properties of bookmarked recipes (sugar content, fat content and a combined FSA-score for recipes) and obesity incidence.\n\n\nAs our dataset spans a 9 year time period we show the stability of such data as predictors.\n\n\nWe show that temporal patterns are also important with obesity rate increasing overall over time. We do acknowledge, however, that there are counties and states for which this is not the case.\n\n\nThe geographical differences in obesity patterns mean that it is also important to account for these in the modeling process.\n\n\nThe good fit achieved by our models suggests that combining interaction data, geographical data and temporal data can be a useful in monitoring obesity incidence.\n\n\n\nLimitations\nThere are several limitations to the analyses we have presented and we wish to acknowledge these directly.\n\n\nThe analyses relate only to the United States and in particular to one food portal—Allrecipes.com. There is no evidence that the findings would be repeated with other websites or in other countries.\n\n\nThe user demographics of Allrecipes.com are skewed in general towards wealthy and densely populated areas. The socio-economic factors relating to obesity are well-documented—higher rates are found among groups with lower educational and income levels, among racial and ethnic minorities, and in high-poverty areas [64]. Although the modeling approaches applied are typically robust to these kinds of issues, the data available may have restricted the quality of the fit achieved.\n\n\nWe restricted our focus to four micro/macro-nutritional components (fat, saturated-fat, sugar and sodium) as well as the FSA metric combining these. Other interesting variables we may have investigated include the WHO metric [48], which accounts for additional properties such as Fiber and Carbohydrates. The USDA Healthy Eating Index (HEI) [69] also encompasses different aspects in the model such as vegetables, fruits, etc.\n\n\n\nFuture work\nWe are currently extending and planning to extend our work in numerous ways:\n\n\nWe are extending our models to include other interactive features (ratings, comment sentiment etc.) to establish if these offer better or additional insight into obesity incidence. In addition, we will investigate the use of nonlinear hierarchical models [70] to better account for the not strictly linear nature of the relations between nutritional elements and outcome variables such as obesity or diabetes.\n\n\nWe are also examining the WHO [66] and HEI [69] metrics to see if these offer additional utility.\n\n\nWe are investigating the possibility of repeating our analyses with other data sources. In particular we hope to repeat the analyses for data in a different country.\n\n\nWe hope to investigate whether interaction data from Allrecipes.com can be combined with other interaction sources, such as longitudinal social media content. The intuition here is that these sources may offer different and complementary insight.\n\n\nWe plan to develop more complex models to investigate the relation of climate. The intuition being that people living in locations with colder climates may be prone to eating more caloric food than people in warmer regions, without this implying larger obesity or diabetes levels. Analyzing this relation more closely might help understanding the effect of geographical factors.\n\n\n']"

They tended to sediment in the hydroponic system and thereby decreasing the actual exposure concentrations, demonstrating the importance of determining the actual exposure concentration. Anatase TiO2 NPs, i.e., E171 and NNM TiO2, significantly reduced growth rate of R. trifolii and did not display a primary particle size dependent effect because they reduced bacterial growth in the same extent and revealed similar aggregate sizes. In the hydroponic system, red clover biomass significantly decreased in all TiO2 NP treatments and NNM TiO2. Red clover plants treated with TiO2 NPs revealed reduced nitrogen (15N) content, indicating impaired nutrition and elevated stress. P25, E171 and NNM TiO2 did affect red clover and R. trifolii in artificial hydroponic cultures, but it remains to be tested which mechanisms are responsible for these effects and whether these effects extend to plants grown in soil.']"

Hepatic methylation patterns across different genomic regions have been reported in two generations. We identified 2338 loci in the parental livers and 2142 loci in the livers of their progeny showing differential methylation between the dietary groups. We compared the DNA methylation changes in progeny livers to existing gene expression changes, but only based on few gene annotations. Although we reported several genes possibly regulated by diet-associated methylation changes, our results are limited to liver tissue, and causal or functional associations remain undiscovered. Thus, it is possible that the relation between DNA methylation and gene expression changes is stronger during early developmental stages or in tissues other than liver. The effects of nutritional induced DNA methylation changes at specific CpG loci in a transgenerational context and the extent of epigenetic gene regulation need to be verified by further studies.']"

Given the important roles of 25(OH)D in the body, it can be recommended that adults have their serum 25(OH)D assessed at routine physical examinations, to determine if treatment is necessary. This group of participants did not consume adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D indicating the necessity of nutrition education. Consideration should be given, when possible, to utilizing FMI to categorize adiposity and making subsequent recommendations for weight maintenance or loss. Treatment recommendations for those shown to be insufficient and deficient would include weight loss if necessary along with vitamin D2 or D3 supplementation in the amount of 6,000–10,000 IU per day [1, 8, 30]. Normalizing serum 25(OH)D through food and supplements has the potential to positively impact several parameters of an individual’s health including weight status, visceral adiposity and waist circumference, strength, and bone health.']"

This provides an estimate of cortical thickness and can be used as an indicator of jaw strength. Using specimens from five different pits ranging from about 37 Kybp to 13 Kybp (just before the extinction of S. fatalis), significant differences were found in both the actual thickness of cortical bone, and the standardized thickness of cortical bone at the lower P4 between pit 13, which had the lowest amount of bone, and pit 61/67 which had the highest. This supports other studies that have shown that individuals in pit 13 were under physiological and perhaps dietary stress, which may be reflected in their deposition of cortical bone, while the opposite trend is seen in the individuals in pit 61/67. This opens the door for future studies on the effects of nutritional stress in S. fatalis and other carnivores at Rancho La Brea and throughout the Pleistocene. The unique sample of juvenile S. fatalis present at Rancho La Brea would be excellent for a continuation of this work.']"

In addition, we have shown that oral supplementation of VA in conjunction with 10% RA can alter total retinol availability and gene expression. Although we are uncertain whether the regulation of these genes in neonates is beneficial, we have gained insight on how neonatal VA supplementation regulates recycling (megalin, Lrp2), trafficking (Rbp4), storage (Lrat), and oxidation of retinoids (Raldhs and Cyp26s). It has been of great interest to determine whether neonatal treatment with VA or RA has any long-term benefit, or at least no adverse effect, in those that have received supplementation at birth; therefore, we have sought to understand the possible long-term effects of neonatal oral supplementation with VARA. The results from this study may help inform the clinical treatment of VA deficiency diseases and the development of nutritional recommendations for neonates.']"

Our results demonstrate that the disturbance in endochondral ossification at the osteochondral junction is strongly correlated with body fat, plasma leptin and plasma TNFα concentrations, and not with exercise. A background of mild lesion incidence in chow-fed animals suggests that lack of exercise is a risk factor. The cellular and molecular mechanism of osteochondrosis is not fully understood in any species, and the relative contribution of body weight, growth rate, physical activity, nutrition and chronic inflammatory state are disputed. Further, molecular or cellular studies in juvenile human tissue are limited. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of the developing growth cartilage to high-lipid feeding, and contribute an additional potential mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of osteochondrosis. The model offers a unique opportunity to determine possible strategies for the prevention or progression of early stable juvenile osteochondrosis in children and adolescents.']"

It was strongly associated with low maternal education, food insecurity, stunting, and STH infections. Hence, focused policies and strategies towards school children should be designed to reduce anemia among food insecure, stunted and low income groups. While designing school based intervention strategies, targeting anemia prevention, and nutritional supplementation is imperative in addition to the existing school based deworming program. Moreover, health education that enhances the knowledge of women about child feeding practices should be given regularly. On top of that, further large scale longitudinal studies using a larger sample size, and including the assessment of all red blood cell indices, red cell morphology, serum micronutrient level, and subclinical infections need to be conducted to identify the cause-effect relationships of anemia with its contributing factors.']"

Despite increases in calcium and magnesium, these and other important nutrients (e.g. fiber and iron) fell short of recommendations in both age groups. Despite the participants enjoying receiving social media information regarding pregnancy health, further efforts are needed to educate this high-risk community on prenatal nutrition and to motivate dietary change for maternal and child health outcomes. This is especially important considering that the majority of participants who entered pregnancy as overweight or obese were more likely to experience EGWG during the intervention. Although teens have increased access to social media, the adults had higher levels of participation during this study. Future interventions are needed to further evaluate the type, frequency and sources of sugar consumed by this population and the best way to implement social media interventions in an effective and enjoyable way.']"
2019-03-14T00:00:00Z,"Direct and indirect effects of elevated CO2 are revealed through shifts in phytoplankton, copepod development, and fatty acid accumulation","['We found that phytoplankton biochemical responses to increased pCO2 differed between our two experimental temperatures and that copepod responses were a result of both direct pCO2 effects and indirect food quality effects. At 12°C there was little change in food quality but naupliar development was faster at high pCO2, while at 17°C phytoplankton food quality increased at moderate pCO2 but did not translate to benefits for the copepods, demonstrating that organism responses ultimately arise from a combination of both direct and nutritional effects of pCO2. This hypothesis is also supported by the decline in the ratio of copepod FA stores to ingested FA with elevated pCO2. This study shows the importance of testing food quality effects on grazers and cautions against a simple extrapolation of phytoplankton biochemistry to higher trophic levels. Carefully designed experimental systems are needed to properly separate direct effects on grazers from the influence of food quality, which has important implications for design and interpretation of many OA experiments.']"
2019-03-14T00:00:00Z,Impaired hepatic mitochondrial function during early lactation in dairy cows: Association with protein lysine acetylation,"['In this work we detected changes in respiratory parameters between early and late lactation and found an association between mitochondrial protein acetylation, respiration and fatty acid metabolism in dairy cows in early lactation. Our results show that cows in a pasture-based system, present impaired mitochondrial function during early lactation, increased acetylation of mitochondrial proteins and decreased levels of sirtuin 3. Overall our results highlight the relevance of nutritional management in this crucial period.During early lactation, an increase in acetyl-CoA, can promote acetylation of mitochondrial proteins. Higher levels of sirtuin 3 in cows in the TMR-based system versus pasture-based system can counter the increase in acetylation and help maintain mitochondrial homeostasis. However, lower sirtuin 3 levels in cows in the pasture-based system could result in increased acetylation of mitochondrial proteins affecting respiration, oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation; potentially leading to accumulation of triglycerides in the liver.']"

With this approach we showed dose and time dependent effects, that are consistent with THY direct and indirect antioxidant activities as well as its influence on other metabolic pathways. Thus, supplementation with THY4 and THY6 promotes the production of eggs with an improved nutritional quality, whose beneficial effects could be sustained for at least 21 days after a 28-day S period is finished. Thymol supplementation would be advisable for the production of healthier table eggs, and fertile eggs. Taken together with previous reports [15], it could also contribute to successful embryo development. Finally, the doses tested herein do not negatively affect productive performance traits nor liver histopathology.']"

Schoolchildren in the highest tertiles of physical activity and sedentary behavior scores were significantly more likely to present a Mixed DP. The “Traditional” DP was associated with the report of food consumption on weekdays (school day) as opposed to non-school days in both sexes.The development of nutritional interventions directed at groups of individuals with similar PAs seems to be a promising strategy for allowing greater specificity in actions. For example, children in “Mixed” PA could be encouraged to decrease consumption of high-fat and industrialized foods and substitute these with healthier foods such as fruits and vegetables. On the other hand, the focus of intervention for the schoolchildren in the “Traditional” pattern would be to maintain the healthy aspects of traditional Brazilian foods. In addition, in order to reduce the high prevalence of overweight observed in the present study, related health interventions must also include programs to increase physical activity levels.']"

Being female was found to have a positive significant effect on the development of food insecurity across a range of settings; however, the association was strongest for low- and middle-income countries. The review found strong significant positive effect on the development of food insecurity among female HIV infected adults living in the low and middle income countries compared to female HIV infected adults living in high income countries. These findings suggest that policy makers, planners, and program managers in these settings should pay attention to gender dynamics in the design and implementation of HIV prevention and control program that address food insecurity. Food, nutrition and HIV intervention programs should be culture and context specific, to address the sex/gender related vulnerability to food insecurity of HIV-infected adults.']"

This study also showed that this low proportion of minimum acceptable diet among 6–23 months age children is determined by a number of individual and community level factors such as age of the child, mother’s occupation, father’s education level, and media exposure, access of household drinking water and region of residence. Therefore, interventions to improve MAD practice should not only be implemented at the individual level but also be tailored to the community context. Utilizing media to promote feeding young children with minimum acceptable diet through enhancing mother’s knowledge on child feeding practices and advocacy for appropriate complementary feeding, particularly on meeting MAD and nutrition education and social and behavior change interventions should be strengthened targeting the infants and children aged 6–8 months and unemployed mothers.']"

This CT tutorial provides valuable step-by-step instructions for using free, but technically challenging, software to quantify both muscle size and composition in the mid-thigh, which was validated against a robust commercially available software. Image J and SliceOmatic generate similar results for the measurement of muscle and fat of all densities at the mid-thigh. We show that by evaluating individual HU sub-ranges, as much as 7.5% of overall total thigh area could be unaccounted for by omitting areas of intermediate density such as VLDM and VHDM. Thus, we recommend all individual HU ranges be evaluated as interests dictate to be the most inclusive of skeletal muscle and to determine responses due to aging and diseases processes, nutritional intervention, or exercise training. This standardized operating procedure will facilitate consistency among investigators reporting computed tomography characteristics of the thigh on single slice images.']"

Decreased sugar intake was documented in Finland, Norway and Sweden but not in Denmark. Different trends resulted in increased country differences in daily fruit/vegetable consumption during the time of observations. However, despite the positive dietary trends documented in the present study, the majority of Nordic adolescents are far from meeting the recommendation. Furthermore, clear and persistent patterns of social inequality remain. Our findings underline the need for more comprehensive initiatives targeting young people’s food habits. These should be based on systematic evaluations of public health initiatives addressing adolescents’ food habits. Finally, further monitoring of socioeconomic patterns in adolescents’ food habits should be highlighted and considered in the planning of future health promotion targeting adolescent nutrition.']"

Moreover, the development of low-gluten cereal products will help improve organoleptic quality and, especially, the nutritional profile for people who follow a low gluten / GFD. In the commercialization of gluten-free foods, traceability is essential to ensure that gluten-free products do not suffer cross-contamination to ensure products suitable for consumption by CD or NCGS sufferers. We have shown that discrimination between transgenic low-gliadin wheats and non-transgenic wheat is possible using NIR technology, and we have developed a robust model for classification.

The largest influential factors for the SOC, TN and TP storages and SRs were the land use types and soil depth. A significant positive relationship existed between storages and SRs. These findings conclude that (1) converting cropland to vegetation significantly enhanced the accumulation of SOC, TN and TP in both topsoil and subsoil; (2) SRs are a practicable indicator to assess the soil quality in artificial vegetation; and (3) the soil quality was improved by converting cropland to vegetation in the LPC. This study underscores the necessity of including subsoil when evaluating soil nutrition accumulation and proposes that SRs can be used as an indicator of the soil quality in artificial vegetation.']"

As in rodents and humans [2, 61], the activation of lipolytic pathways could induce inflammatory responses and changes in AT immune cell trafficking. These alterations in inflammation patterns may be modulated in part by oxylipids generated during lipolysis [11]. Results from our study indicate that changes in the oxylipid profiles of AT and plasma are linked with lipolysis intensity. Enhanced availability of LA coincided with increased 13-HODE content in AT and plasma. At the same time, lipolysis was associated with increased AT concentrations of ArA metabolites including 15-HETE. Elucidating the effects of these ArA- and LA-derived oxylipids on AT function during the periparturient period will aid the development of nutritional interventions that can modulate the deleterious effects of excessive lipolysis on dairy cow health and lactation performance.']"

The results show differences in glycerophospholipid and glycosphingolipid metabolism, aspartate and asparagine metabolism, and purine and pyrimidine metabolism pathways in CQ-R vs CQ-S subjects prior to antimalarial treatment. Based on previous studies, low catabolism of host hemoglobin with further lower hemozoin formation in P. vivax-infected reticulocytes in CQ-resistant parasites could be involved in this sequence of metabolic alteration. Although the number of samples in this study was small, the results demonstrate the future potential of HRM in identifying P. vivax infected individuals that are likely to show CR, and thus facilitate the design of optimal treatment plans. We present differentially expressed metabolites and perturbed pathways that will require further validation in clinical human cohorts and animal studies. Components of host metabolism regulation may be involved in the PvCR phenomenon, including the effects of nutritional, metabolic and immune factors.']"

We assessed environmental impacts of these strategies and investigated options which could further reduce environmental impacts from an LCA perceptive.The Vegetarian diet had lower environmental impacts than the PNNS diet, which had lower environmental impacts than the current Average diet. Increasing omega-3 contents of the diets by including foods higher in omega-3 did not influence the diets’ environmental impacts. Such substitutions, however, can provide healthier diets without increasing environmental impacts or pressure on fish stocks. Animal foods dominated the environmental impacts of waste in the average current diet.']"

This, however, is likely to be a rare event and probably only happens if alternative food such as soil surface litter material is missing. Further experiments should investigate if L. terrestris consumes the torn off plant parts immediately or leaves them on or in the soil to decay and later consumption. Lumbricus terrestris preferred legume litter material over those of grasses and herbs, and data on earthworm weight change suggests that soil surface litter is a crucial component of the diet of this earthworm species which cannot be compensated for by herbivory. Our results on the minor biological significance of earthworm herbivory suggest that earlier herbivory studies ignoring earthworms did not introduce a major artefact. While herbivory on plants beyond the initial seedling stage may only play a minor role in earthworm nutrition and have limited potential to influence plant growth, earthworm effects on plants at the cotyledon stage needs further investigation.']"

In conclusion, consumption of VOO, or phenol-enriched VOOs, has an impact on the HDL proteome in a cardioprotective mode that could enhance HDL functionality by up-regulating proteins related to cholesterol homeostasis, protection against oxidation, and blood coagulation while down-regulating proteins involved in acute-phase response, lipid transport, and immune response. The common protein expression modifications reported after the three VOOs indicate an important effect of the fatty acid and PC composition present in the common matrix of these VOO on the HDL remodeling. Further studies are needed, however, in order to assess the specific effects of each VOO incorporating different phenolic contents.']"

In the process of P. medicaginis colonization of the alfalfa leaves, glycolysis, TCA cycle and β-oxidation metabolism pathways in the infected leaves accumulated strongly at later infection stages, which may provide ATP, a N source and nutrition for P. medicaginis to colonize alfalfa leaves. Moreover very strong induction of the TCA cycle pathways by the pathogen at later infection stage may induce senescence in alfalfa leaves, leading to plant death. Intermediates metabolites of these metabolic pathways, and inositol phosphate, glutathione, some amino acids metabolic pathways, such as glycine, leucine, isoleucine, tyrosine and lysine, accumulated rapidly and strongly at an early infection stage may enhance the ability of alfalfa to resist necrotrophic P. medicaginis. The tentatively identified differential metabolites and related pathways may serve as potential markers for developing novel disease-control strategies and breeding resistant varieties.']"
2015-10-01T00:00:00Z,Examining the Impact of a Public Health Message on Fish Consumption in Bermuda,"['This study provides evidence that public health messages by the Government of Bermuda, which advocated that pregnant women consume fewer large fish, may be effective. The majority of women who consume fish report that they eat less large fish species, such as swordfish. Consumption of small fish species with highly beneficial nutrient profiles is reportedly low in this population. Some women reported lowering their consumption of these species during pregnancy, and if these are the only fish they eat, messaging could be unduly adverse to the nutrition of these women. Public health messages may need clarification so that women understand that it is acceptable to continue, even increase, their consumption of smaller fish species during pregnancy. Given the importance of maritime culture to Bermuda, health promotion activities centered on fish or fishing, such as cooking demonstrations with anchovies and sardines, or community-based programs that subsidize or give-away smaller fish species to pregnant women, may be promising avenues of intervention in the future.']"

Although, we used just one organo-chlorine pesticide at a nonlethal level, the severity of implications to health of concurrent exposure to a cocktail of low dose pesticides and biotic/abiotic stressors may be far greater, as can be correlated with the noticeable enormous fish biodiversity loss worldwide. We found synergistic effects of exposures to very low concentrations of a pesticide and pathogen infection, leading to further decreased immunocompetence and enhanced mortality in fish with already compromised stress responses, which can be counteracted with dietary lipotropic compounds that enhance immunity and the detoxification efficiency of the liver. This physiological basis indicates that nonlethal pesticide toxicities, along with induced nutritional deficiency stress, may be a driver for aquatic species decline or extinction, and appropriate strategies like dietary lipotropes may be used for resurrecting the endangered and declining aquatic species.']"

However, given the stability of the mucosal bacteria over time observed in the current study, relative shifts in mucosal bacteria may play a role in pig performance during periods of reduced and improved growth. Further, early dietary challenge resulted in prolonged alterations in the mucosa bacterial profile but the effect was species specific and more associated with antibiotic inclusion than diet complexity which may have implications for evaluation of nutritional alternatives to in-feed antibiotics. This project is a unique assessment of microbial populations within the context of multi-ingredient (i.e. practical swine) diets and attempts were made to address possible confounding factors and maintain conclusions within the limitations of the study design.']"

Furthermore, these changes express a dual burden in this population. On one side we see a reduction in malnourished youth; on the other, a rise in the prevalence of overweight and obesity probably linked to the rapid urbanization process and lifestyle modifications. Public education policies and intervention programs must be established and implemented to stop the increase in overweight and obesity, which may reduce the risk of chronic diseases development in later life. Further, great care must be taken to reduce, or better eradicate the problem of under-nutrition in youth. Since urbanization sprawl and organization, food intake, levels of physical activity, and time spent in sedentary activities may also be associated with the present findings, future studies should be conducted to identify their impact on the growth and health of children and adolescents.']"

Importantly, aerobic fitness assessments using health-related criteria and performance-based standards may best identify youth with low levels of physical fitness. We also demonstrated the feasibility of blood pressure screening in urban public schools.

2014-09-09T00:00:00Z,Characterization of a Soluble Phosphatidic Acid Phosphatase in Bitter Melon (Momordica charantia),"['Phosphatidic acid phosphatases (PAPs) catalyze the dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol, the penultimate step in TAG synthesis. PAPs are widely present in plants, animals, microbes and human. PAPs are typically categorized into two subfamilies: Mg2+-dependent soluble PAP and Mg2+-independent membrane-associated PAP. In this study, we provided evidence for the existence of a new class of PAP enzyme in bitter melon (Momordica charantia). This class of PAP is soluble and Mg2+-independent. PAP protein is probably associated with other proteins in the oilseeds. Bitter melon has been used as herbal medicine for a long time. The molecular basis of these uses is supported by recent studies showing the potential of bitter melon oil being used in a wide range of nutritional and medicinal applications. Therefore, understanding and regulating PAP activities may lead to increased yield of bitter melon oil. The elucidation of PAP functions may lead to novel approaches to modulate cellular lipid storage and metabolic diseases.']"

Seeping fluids recovered by trapping in the GATS markers had distinct chemical compositions from the ambient seawater. Particularly, high pH of the accumulated GATS fluid is the first direct evidence for on-going seepage of serpentinization-associated geofluid in this area. The highly alkaline fluids rich in hydrogen sulfide and methane can serve as an energy and nutrient sources to sustain chemosynthetic productions and associated animal communities. Carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur isotope systematics of various components in the SSF suggest that most of the animals living there rely on chemosynthetic production. On the other hand, some animals use not only chemosynthetic products but also photosynthetic products. It means that sinking particles from the euphotic zone are also important nutritional sources for animals inhabiting the SSF, despite being at a depth of ~5,700 m.']"

In addition, the lack of GP in astrocyte-like glia suggests that the cellular localization of the glycogen breakdown might differ from vertebrate astrocytes. We anticipate that GS and GP both provide useful markers for future studies that attempt a more refined functional classification of glial populations in honey bees and other insects. Such reappraisal of previous glial cell classification systems already suggested different subtypes of astrocyte-like glia, for example, and the annotation of additional glial cell classes [15]. Concerning aging, using glial-specific markers in the honey bee now allows to study in more detail the associations of a protein with age protective characteristics (vitellogenin) and glial cells, which we have previously reported [83].We hope our findings can inspire future studies in the honey bee model to better understand the role of neuron-glia interaction in memory formation, aging, and nutritional physiology.']"

Given the epidemiological profile of the Latin-American region, with non-communicable diseases and obesity as the leading causes of death and morbidity, urgent actions are required to address this public health problems. Other more directive or semi-directive labeling formats, such as the Warning labels or the Multiple Traffic Light, could be more effective in helping the most vulnerable consumers make healthier food choices, particularly decreasing consumption of critical ingredients. Future studies should explore the effect of these labels on the actual purchasing behavior of Latin-American consumers [55], as well as the need of parallel mass-communication campaigns to improve label understanding and incentivize consumers to improve their food choices.']"

The unexpected findings could be due to factors such as, lower BMI, and reduced energy intake. Furthermore, non-GDM women maintained a high DP score for all DPs from pre-pregnancy until second trimester of pregnancy, meanwhile GDM women showed lower and/or inconsistent DP scores, suggesting that non-GDM might have a lower genetic susceptibility to GDM as they are not at risk of GDM despite having also high DP scores for less healthy DPs (pattern 2 and pattern 3). A future large-scale prospective study or a well-designed randomized controlled trial is warranted to further confirm the association between the dietary pattern and the GDM in the Malaysian population. Such findings could inform efforts to strengthen existing or develop appropriate health and nutrition strategies to address the increasing rate of GDM in Malaysia.']"
2019-07-22T00:00:00Z,A critique of the objective function utilized in calculating the Thrifty Food Plan,"['The Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) is the principal policy lever behind the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), a federal food aid program administered under the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) that affects 42 million Americans. Despite its importance, it has received surprisingly little attention from academics. The TFP is a quadratic programming problem containing an objective function that determines an allocation by seeking to minimize the purchase-weighted difference between the logarithmic transformation of a given allocation and actual consumption subject to constraints that ensure adequate caloric and nutritional intake, a federally-mandated budget, and consumption of the USDA mandated “pyramid” [10]. There is also a budget constraint.The purpose of this research is to demonstrate that several alternative formulations to the USDA’s TFP model are theoretically and computationally more straightforward, are easier to interpret, have improved goodness-of-fit to current consumption, and feature allocations that are not substantially sparser than the current model (1). In particular, models (2), (3), and (4) provide better fit to current consumption than the USDA model (1) for all sex/age groups examined. Models (3) and (4) are often no more sparse than model (1), with Gini Coefficients that usually are less than or equal to that of model (1).If the main objective is to find a nutritious diet that is closest to actual/current consumption patterns, model (3) is most commonly superior across all age/sex groups with the best goodness-of-fit overall. Yet there are a few exceptions, namely coffee, which has relatively low allocations in model (3) compared to actual consumption and the other model solutions. However, if the main objective is to find a well-rounded (i.e. least sparse) diet that is also closest to current consumption patterns, all models have less sparsity than the USDA model, and model (4) generally has the least sparsity.In closing, we caution that while our modeling results show the value of alternative approaches to calculating the TFP (and thus for examining the cost of existing diets), these results should not be mistaken for proposals of dietary change in a population. There is no objective criteria to determine what would be acceptable as an optimal dietary change for a population.']"

Circadian clock genes in the brain in response to photoperiod alterations, possibly through npas2/bmal1 stimulation (Fig 6), may play a role in the signalling cascade involved in triggering puberty. LL appears to affect gnrh1, kiss2 and estrogen signalling (via esr1), while AP appears to affect gnrh2, gnrh1 and kiss1rb (Fig 6). Gene promoter analysis predicted nutritional/metabolism related genes within the reproduction related gene network, and one such gene, galr1b, was highly responsive to photoperiod treatments (Fig 6). Regardless of the photoperiod regime, gnrh1 was markedly affected by LL and AP suggesting a central role in the integration/translation of light stimuli to the reproduction-related gene network associated with pubertal onset.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0144158.g006\nFig 6\n\nDiagram summarizing the results obtained in this study.\nThe key genes involved in gonadotropin stimulation and activation of the BPG axis are highly responsive soon after photoperiodic shift and prior to pubertal activation.

2014-08-25T00:00:00Z,The Immune System in Children with Malnutrition—A Systematic Review,"['In spite of the prevalence of malnutrition, and its fatal consequences, scientific interest in the immune deficiency of malnutrition seems dwindling, and little research has been carried out on the topic during the last ten years. For this reason, most evidence on the subject relies on immunological methods used 30 to 40 years ago, many of which are no longer in use, and little research has been done with modern methods, and with the present understanding of immunology. Moreover, most studies have looked at isolated aspects of immune function, despite the fact that the parameters are interdependent, and the division into innate and adaptive immune function seems to be a simplification. Thus, our understanding of immune function in malnutrition is still very limited.This review illuminates the little that we know about the immunological alterations associated with malnutrition, and also points to significant gaps in our knowledge. Future well designed prospective cohort studies should examine how immune parameters are related to morbidity and mortality in malnourished children, with detailed characteristic of nutritional status, preferably body composition, of infections, enteropathy and of low-grade inflammation. When testing nutritional and medical interventions for malnutrition, immune parameters should be included as outcomes. Studies should investigate newer immunological parameters in malnutrition, like expression of innate pattern recognition receptors (as the Toll-like receptor), the lectin pathway of the complement system and mTOR expression and activity. It should be investigated whether a small thymus is associated with lower output of recent thymic-derived T-cells, and how it correlates with hormones like leptin, cortisol, insulin and Insulin Growth Factor-1. Innate and adaptive immune parameters should be assessed simultaneously, taking into account their dynamic interdependency. To understand whether malnutrition is indeed associated with active down-regulation of immune reactivity (as formulated in the “tolerance hypothesis”), the balance between regulatory T-lymphocytes and their counterparts, Th17 lymphocytes should be measured. Finally, prospective studies among children at risk should assess whether immune profiles differ in those who subsequently develop oedematous and non-oedematous malnutrition, and it should be investigated whether children with oedematous malnutrition have markers suggestive of auto-immune or inflammatory diseases. Such studies would reduce our current ignorance on the interplay between malnutrition and infectious diseases.']"

And, it has tended to be seen as an amorphous package. Program performance has been tracked in terms of contacts, with the ANC4+ indicator being the main performance measure used. Often this has been operationalized specifying that the contact needs to be with a “skilled birth attendant”, i.e. a health worker with the full set of midwifery competencies (excluding services given by other categories of health worker or health auxiliary). But the content of care has not received equal attention from the maternal-newborn community. Instead, it is other programs (malaria, nutrition, immunization, HIV, etc.) that have given attention to particular interventions provided during pregnancy. Such neglect of content represents an important missed opportunity to achieve better population maternal-newborn outcomes. Optimal strategy for delivering such content will depend on context. But with more serious attention to ensuring provision of an appropriate set of interventions at high coverage, particularly among disadvantaged populations, substantially reduced mortality is achievable.']"

We observed interaction effects between gestation period and BW on DM, CP, crude fat, Tyr, TAA, EAA, C14:0, C16:1, C17:0, C18:0, C18:2n6c, C20:4n6, C22:6n3, MUFA, PUFA, and n-6PUFA concentrations. As gestation progresses, BW increases along with DM and crude fat concentrations, while deposition of CP decreases. The most marked differences occur primarily during mid-gestation and late-gestation. LBW fetuses exhibit decreased amounts of crude fat and several FAs (including C14:0, C16:1, C17:0, and C18:2n6c) during mid-gestation and late-gestation, which may in turn affect the adaptability, growth, and development of the fetus. These findings may provide a theoretical basis for developing nutritional interventions that target fetuses with low birth weight in animals. Additional studies are needed to demonstrate the underlying mechanisms through which these effects occur during gestation.']"

Their diets were predominantly based on a high consumption of cereals, beans, eggs and processed foods and a low consumption of fruits, vegetables and dairy products, which is in line with results from other national surveys conducted in the general population of El Salvador. These results could be reflecting the nutritional transition El Salvador is experiencing.Institutionalized children were more likely to adhere to a healthy dietary pattern whereas children in poverty were more likely to have less varied and healthy diets.The stunting prevalence was higher than what is estimated for the non HIV infected population from El Salvador, but no other marked differences in terms of weight for height indicators or dietary patterns were observed. However, as HIV infected children and adolescents are at higher risk of developing metabolic alterations, we highlight the need to assess their dietary practices in different context in order to advocate for interventions promoting a healthy life style as a complement to their pharmacological therapy.']"

Further testing of these strains for the discovery of novel and efficient antimicrobials should be considered. Microporus sp. strain BPSM 33 showed the highest antagonistic potential against the phytopathogen F. oxysporum with 85.71% of inhibition and could be used for the development of biocontrol agent against F. oxysporum. Furthermore, the genetic variation among the potential strains showing antimicrobial potential was considered by using RAPD and ISSR molecular markers. We reported that the selected markers can be used for assessing genetic diversity of wild mushrooms, considering both marker systems gave similar results in the present study.

We have provided a global transcriptome study of T. brucei during its travel through the insect vector by monitoring transcript abundance in trypanosomes isolated from three distinct tissues, i.e. the midgut, proventriculus and the salivary gland. In addition, this approach has very recently been extended to highlight the host-parasite interactions in the tsetse salivary glands [39]. Although we recognize that the salivary gland trypanosome transcriptome is rather complex and impossible to tease apart, since it contains data from proliferating epimastigotes as well as cell-cycle arrested and transmission competent metacyclics, the presented RNA-Seq datasets constitute the first resource of its kind that will facilitate further interrogation of “heart of darkness” T. brucei life-cycle stages in the tsetse vector.']"

The population is ready to eat insects more frequently if the two problems of seasonal availability and cost are solved. Most of the Lao population harvest their own insects and only a third of them are regular buyers. The sale of insects is a female profession and represents an interesting source of income, although locally seasonal.Developing insect farming habits may contribute to generation of income, particularly among women, increase yearly availability, and help decrease the impact on the environment from extensive harvesting.

While the degree of glucose control and optimal caloric supplementation remain unclear, it is generally accepted that hyperglycemia foreshadows poor outcome in critical illness, and recent evidence suggests that early caloric supplementation may worsen outcome [8]. The mechanisms underlying the development of hyperglycemia in sepsis remain poorly defined, and the protective role of endogenous insulin production versus the detrimental role of glucose toxicity continues to be controversial. Our data suggest that a mechanism exists whereby glucose supplementation early in the evolution of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome combines to drive the development of peripheral insulin resistance and suppresses pancreatic insulin production thereby amplifying metabolic decompensation and worsening the degree of hyperglycemia and potentially outcome. Additional investigation is required to explore the mechanism by which circulating glucose and systemic inflammation interact to alter glucose disposal and the pancreatic beta cell response to hyperglycemia in the setting of sepsis.']"

Further, uterine blood flow was increased in early pregnancy if the heifer was pregnant to a male rather than a female fetus. Sex specific differences in feto-placental perfusion indices exist in the bovine as previously reported in the human [1] and such indices are susceptible to dietary perturbation. The identification of these effects adds to our knowledge of the physiology of male and female fetuses in utero. In accord with a previous report [13] the cardiovascular system of the female fetus was altered by the early in utero low protein diet. Fetal organ development has been shown to be affected by changes in maternal nutrition associated with changes in placental hormone production, with such effects having a sex bias. Altered fetal haemodynamics in utero may be part of the mechanism involved, making further investigation of the sex specific differences present during fetal life important. This study affords additional insight into the gender specific circulatory differences that exist through gestation.']"

Our results reveal that upon the satiating treatment, five transporter transcripts were markedly up-regulated within 1 h of refeeding, indicating that they may be promising candidate genes involved in a rapid-response signaling system that regulates fish myotomal muscle growth. These genes display coordinated regulation in favoring the resumption of myogenesis as an early response to feeding. Therefore, the present findings provide a crucial foundation for a more comprehensive understanding of the physiological function of amino acid transporters and their nutritional regulation, which may also provide practical applications in aquaculture.']"

Additionally, our analyses showed that other hydrocarbon degrading- and sulfate-reducing microbes as well as seep macro- and/or megafauna contribute to the nutrition of the crab. The stable carbon isotope- and lipid composition of the crab tissue confirmed that it is an opportunistic scavenger, using both, chemosynthetically as well as photosynthetically derived carbon in its diet. This agrees well with the shape of the crab's feeding appendages, which are functionally similar to other lithodid deep-sea crabs with an omnivorous diet (including detritus) and an opportunistic and vagrant life style.

By analyzing model simulations and comparing them with experimental data, we have provided a conceptual framework linking the nutritional status to toxin production in this alga. In particular, we have identified four physiological processes directly associated with an increasing state of intra-cellular nutrient stress (increase of C:P and C:N cellular ratio): i) a sharp decrease in chlorophyll synthesis ii) an enhancement of toxin production, iii) the release (exudation) of toxin in the environment and iv) a reduction in metabolic maintenance leading to the formation of resting stages.By comparing model simulations with literature data, we have highlighted that our model has the potential to simulate the stoichiometric regulation of C-rich toxins in different marine dinoflagellates. The next step will be to implement the presented formulation in a comprehensive ecosystem modeling framework (for example the ERSEM-GOTM system [21]) and to use it to investigate and predict the effect of nutrient supply in the formation and evolution of harmful algal blooms.']"

Depending on the protease down-regulated, we noticed difficulties with nematode progeny hatching by knocking down Mi-ser-1 and disturbance to infect a new host plant when knocking down Mi-cpl-1. Although animal proteases are known to be important for protein digestion mainly for feeding and nutrition, they can play different roles in a many biological processes. Based on the data presented here we can conclude that at least two of the three proteases studied are possibly implicated in nematode reproduction, embryogenesis and offspring virulence. They are therefore attractive targets to engineer plants able to deliver nematode proteases dsRNA during infection. The cell specific knock-down of such proteases using promoters with strong preference for feeding cells, and also pyramiding with other nematode essential genes, could therefore be an attractive strategy to generate new tools for phytonematode control.

Wheat lines with very low content of the specific gluten proteins (near gliadin-free) that are the causal agents for pathologies such as celiac disease were obtained by RNAi. This reduced-gliadin bread has a higher lysine content and similar bread-making quality to normal bread, and therefore could enormously contribute to improve the diet of these patients. Results reported here represent a great advance in the development of food safe for people around the world suffering gluten-related pathologies, with excellent organoleptic properties and greater nutritional quality. However, transgenic wheat is highly regulated and, currently, not commercially grown and this can limit or delay the proposed strategy. The results presented here indicate that flour and bread with reduced levels of these gliadins would be safer for gluten intolerant consumers, although the value of this material still depends on whether or not it can become commercially available, or if these results can be translated into something that is commercially available.']"
2015-07-29T00:00:00Z,The thiG Gene Is Required for Full Virulence of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae by Preventing Cell Aggregation,"['The findings in this study demonstrated that the thiG gene, which is involved in the thiazole moiety production in thiamine biosynthesis pathway, is required for the full virulence of Xoo on rice. The knockout of thiG in Xoo caused a decrease in growth rate in limited nutrition medium, but not in the host. Meanwhile, the formation of cell-cell aggregates like biofilm formation, swarming motility and bacterial migration in rice were influenced in the thiG mutant. These results suggest that the loss of virulence maybe caused by a reduction in the infection progression in rice. Moreover, the deletion of thiG suppressed the expression level of the rpfC and rpfG, which might indirectly induce abnormal regulation of thiamine biosynthesis in the thiG mutant. Xanthan production was not changed in the mutant but the expression of some gum genes were up-regulated, but how the absence of thiG affects the regulation of gum gene expression needs further study. These results provide new insight about role of the thiG gene in Xoo virulence and serve as an example for future research to investigate alternative functions of genes in vitamin biosynthesis pathways.']"

We also have shown that the magnitude of the inequities differed significantly according to environment (higher in urban or more developed areas) and socio-economic factors (lower for higher levels of education and professional activity) and discussed that these variations were much likely linked to socio-cultural issues related to women’s social role. Prevention wise, as well as reducing the global level of obesity, nutrition interventions or policies should then also pay specific attention to reduce that obesity gender gap which fuels gender inequities in health: - in the short term by public health interventions targeted at women (as a group specially at risk of obesity in this context) - in the more long term by policies aiming at reducing disparities (including socio-economic disparities) between genders in this context [68], [69], [70].']"

The expression of three types of opsin genes varied according to time of day and environmental conditions and was regulated by a circadian clock, light conditions and nutritional status. Ha-UV and Ha-BL were more abundant during the day than at night, which aided recognition of short-wavelength light during the day. However, Ha-LW levels decreased during the day and increased at night, which might be useful in a dim-light environment. Ha-LW levels were up-regulated in males, which might aid in locating potential sex partners and improving mating success over relatively short distances. Interestingly, daily changes in opsin mRNA levels in H. armigera did not differ much from those in diurnal insects, suggesting that opsin genes in H. armigera might play an important role in color vision, especially color perception and discrimination.']"
2014-08-20T00:00:00Z,Comparison of Glucose and Lipid Metabolic Gene Expressions between Fat and Lean Lines of Rainbow Trout after a Glucose Load,"['The present study mainly reveals the differences in the transcriptional regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism after a GTT between two genotypes of rainbow trout. In both lines, intraperitoneal administration of glucose led to a prolonged hyperglycemia, this relative inability to utilize high levels of glucose was associated with a lack of regulation of gluconeogenesis. However, compared to L line, regulation of glycemia was more stable in F line, linked to higher muscle glycogen content and an enhanced expression of glycolytic gene markers in the liver, after glucose treatment. Some of these observations are coherent with the findings of previous nutritional challenge studies [16], [32], [33] and support our hypothesis that the F line has a higher capability to maintain glucose homeostasis after a glucose load than the L line. Our data are also helpful for understanding glucose use in carnivorous fish. Therefore, genetic selection is apparently a possible way to modify the poor capability of glucose hemostasis in carnivorous fish, primarily by influencing the regulation of key enzymes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism.']"
2018-06-27T00:00:00Z,Timing of complementary feeding and associations with maternal and infant characteristics: A Norwegian cross-sectional study,"[""The majority of Norwegian infants are fed in accordance with national infant feeding recommendations. Predictors for early introduction to complementary food were breastfeeding status and maternal sociodemographic factors. Introduction of solid food before five months of age was associated with increased infant weight gain. Timing of introduction to complementary food was not, except for the infant's gender, associated with infant cues that may be markers of increased nutritional needs of the infant. Our results confirm that infants of younger, less educated and smoking mothers are still at higher risk of not being fed in compliance with the official infant feeding recommendations. Altogether, our findings emphasize the importance of targeting socioeconomically disadvantaged mothers for support on healthy feeding practices focusing on the infant's needs to prevent early onset of social inequalities in health with potential life-long duration. Larger population-based studies with a longitudinal design are needed to further explore the relationship between timing of complementary feeding, maternal socioeconomic status and infant growth trajectories.""]"
2018-07-19T00:00:00Z,Metabolic equivalent of task (METs) thresholds as an indicator of physical activity intensity,"['The physical activity thresholds generated for the entire sample (moderate: 4.9 METs; vigorous: 6.8 METs) were not chosen arbitrarily, but were created following methodological criteria appropriate to this objective and using categories of relative intensity for each participant as a criterion measure. As a result, the identified intensity thresholds were higher and presented higher specificity when compared to thresholds currently recommended. The use of the proposed thresholds in this study aims to improve the quality of physical activity measure, minimizing errors in the evaluation of physical activity intensities. Moreover, these parameters presented relatively high accuracy, including when specifically applied to groups of sex, age, nutritional status and physical fitness. Therefore, the overall thresholds, as well as those related specifically to men and women, might be an important alternative to minimize physical activity intensity misclassification. The results presented in this study contribute towards more accurate physical activity measure and highlight the relevance of a better understanding regarding the impact of physical activity intensity thresholds in health outcomes.']"
2005-01-25T00:00:00Z,Educating the Brain to Avoid Dementia: Can Mental Exercise Prevent Alzheimer Disease?,"['So far, we have little evidence that mental practice will help prevent the development of dementia. We have better evidence that good brain health is multiply determined, that brain development early in life matters, and that genetic influences are of great importance in accounting for individual differences in cognitive reserve and in explaining who develops Alzheimer disease and who does not. At least half of the explanation for individual differences in susceptibility to Alzheimer disease is genetic, although the genes involved have not yet been completely discovered [15]. The balance of the explanation lies in environmental influences and behavioral health practices, alone or in interaction with genetic factors.For older adults, health practices that could influence the brain include sound nutrition, sufficient sleep, stress management, treatment of mood or anxiety disorders, good vascular health, physical exercise, and avoidance of head trauma. But there is no convincing evidence that memory practice and other cognitively stimulating activities are sufficient to prevent Alzheimer disease; it is not just a case of “use it or lose it.”']"
2017-10-24T00:00:00Z,Demographics and practices of semi-intensive free-range farming systems in Australia with an outdoor stocking density of ≤1500 hens/hectare,"['This study was able to capture a previously undocumented section of the industry comprising of small to medium–scale farms that are not usually affiliated to any industry service body, but have emerged in big numbers across Australia and provide their products either through farmer’s markets or local stores. Although this study has attempted to document the practices, other studies are needed to conduct a census and record all enterprises that fall under this category. It is an important section of the industry and needs to be accounted for, to realise the full scope of egg production in Australia.Some of the unique characteristics of these semi-intensive free-range farms with an outdoor stocking density of ≤1500 birds/hectare include the presence of two types of housing systems, the fixed sheds and the mobile/caravan style housing. No scientifically validated research has been conducted to optimise the climate control, nesting and feeding in the mobile housing systems and to determine their effects on nutrition, health and welfare of birds. Range usage has been reported to be high in these systems with majority of birds accessing the range area and a large proportion of the outdoor range area being utilised. Dilution of allocated feed rations by elements consumed on range along with extra requirements due to temperature maintenance and increased physical activity need to be taken into account while formulating diets for free-range birds. High mortality rates have been attributed to predation, grass impaction, heat stress, disease and parasites, and smothering, all of which had been eradicated by introduction of intensive systems in the past but have re-emerged in these free-range systems. Adequate veterinarian support and training is a major requirement to manage and contain these conditions. Biosecurity could be improved on the farms with improved uptake of a number of actions by regular monitoring and dedicated workshops relevant to these systems. Management of manure and run-off needs to be put in place to prevent pollution of ground and surface water through leaching. Better legislation on planning of the farms is needed, to provide sustainable and environmentally conscious systems which account for welfare of birds. Overall a nation-wide training and support network consisting of experts on production and management, nutrition, health, welfare, environmental impact and biosecurity can help to sustain and expand these systems on a long term basis. Data and traceability for these farms is important to account for the total egg production statistics and to ensure health and welfare for all types of free-range enterprises in Australia.']"
2016-07-08T00:00:00Z,The Effects of High Level Magnesium Dialysis/Substitution Fluid on Magnesium Homeostasis under Regional Citrate Anticoagulation in Critically Ill,"['In conclusion, the present study shows that the loss of Mg in RCA with conventional fluids is not balanced by the concentrations in commercially available dialysis/substitution fluids. Citrate anticoagulation of CRRT may lead to depletion of the bodies magnesium pool with potential for organ dysfunction. The difficult assessment of intracellular magnesium particularly in intensive care calls for magnesium loading tests [6] to reveal a possible magnesium deficit under continuous citrate anticoagulation. Standard low level of magnesium in substitution fluid does not prevent development of hypomagnesemia during citrate CRRT which increases daily requirements for magnesium to extra 2 to 3 grams of MgSO4. This requirement may increase with CRRT dosage above 20–25 ml/kg.h. A risk of magnesium depletion seems to be avoided with the novel fluid [21] which has magnesium level doubled (1.50 mmol/l) compared to the ordinary fluids used in intensive care however, validation and safety require further research. The fluid provided magnesium levels with no extra replenishment other than magnesium content in ordinary commercially available enteral and parenteral nutrition.']"

AD and AR grains are the most capable of changing the fatty acid contents. AV increased the palmitic acid content in milk, thus it may have been able to increase antimutagenic potential in fermented milk. The storage time leads to changes in fatty acid compositions in milk, so that stocked milk can have higher anticarcinogenic potential due to the high amount of oleic acid. Furthermore, storage can be used to decrease SFA and increase MUFA levels. Only high-lipidic matrix showed an increase of PUFA after fermentation. The CLA concentration did not increase significantly among kefir grains, storage time and fat concentration of the milk. Total fat was the only chemical characteristic not altered during fermentation and storage. Acidity and protein content increased while pH decreased during fermentation, but not due to storage time. Additionally, studies intending to optimize desaturase activity during fermentation conditions may contribute to obtaining a fermented product with a higher nutritional lipid quality.']"

The study shows that Vihiga County is very rich in agrobiodiversity. However, this rich diversity is diminishing due to reliance on a few species by many farmers leaving many other–nutritious—species underutilized. Despite the rich diversity, the diets are low in diversity and micronutrient content with very limited consumption of animal source foods. Policy makers and program implementers aiming to improve diets of communities living in rural areas should aim at promotion of utilization of agrobiodiversity innovatively. For example, integrating local, neglected and underutilized plant species in home gardening and promoting their access through community actions such as biodiversity fairs, diversity kits and establishing community-based home garden resource centers and use of community platforms such as breastfeeding mothers’ clubs and merry-go rounds to promote local agrobiodiversity. Other avenues of promotion of the underutilized nutritious species can be through schools either through learning plots or through school meals programs.']"
2018-04-20T00:00:00Z,How does food addiction influence dietary intake profile?,"['Obesity epidemic is a major global health problem. Desire for highly energy-dense and reinforcing foods is reported to be contributing to weight gain by recent studies. Increased consumption of high-fat and high-sugar foods have resulted in increased number of food addicts in developed and developing countries. Consequently, presence of food addiction is related with energy dense food consumption and obesity; mainly abdominal fat accumulation. Since food addiction is predominantly influenced and provoked by compulsive behaviour and emotional and environmental factors such as stress, socio-cultural status and habitual characteristics, these factors should be taken into account in future studies. In addition, future randomised controlled researches would contribute to identifying characteristics, combinations and concentrations of ingredients which are potentially addictive. Efforts to improve nutrition knowledge and promote consciousness about food label reading may assist individuals to make more informed food choices. Corporate responsibility, public health approaches, environmental change and global efforts seem to be essential in reducing food and substance related problems involving obesity and other addiction symptoms.']"

Generally, the IPIs, anaemia and malnutrition are still public health problems among this indigenous community. IPIs were found to be significantly associated with anaemia. Meanwhile, the incidence of malnutrition (i.e., stunting, underweight and wasting) was higher among infected children with IPIs. Absence of toilets and close contact with animals was identified as significant predictors for IPIs. No parental formal education was significantly associated with anaemia. As for malnutrition, low household income was identified as a significant predicator for both stunting and underweight. This data strongly support the need for implementing health program aimed at improving nutrition, anaemic conditions and reducing the prevalence of infections, with potentially beneficial effects on cognitive and educational outcomes particularly among children. With effective control measures in place, these children will have a greater opportunity for a better future in terms of health and educational attainment, which will eventually put them on par socially and economically with other communities in Malaysia.']"

Preventive strategies should focus on sensitization campaigns to reduce overweight and obesity in parents and reinforcement of clinical measures such as weight gain surveillance during antenatal consultation which will help prevent children from high birth weight and overweight later in life. A clinical follow up of children with high birth weight is also necessary to prevent them from later childhood overweight. These campaigns and clinical measures should be especially strengthened in Grassfield area. Further studies including nutritional characteristics are of great interest to understand the association with religion, child age and ecological area in this age group.

Both, results from plot and filed scale experiments provide sufficient evidence to support feasibility for the UAV-modeling approach and potential for broad scalability to other grass species, soil types and weather conditions, but the testing and validation of this hypothesis warrants further carefully conducted investigations.Importantly, this study supports the use of fine scale resolution maps based upon UAV-derived estimations of pasture biomass to guide grazing management decisions. Further, this work also demonstrates that it is technically possible to link UAV data and process-based crop models for use as a decision support tool to monitor, assess and plan grazing management. However, to become a practical approach for use by land managers and farmers future technical work must focus on the automation of UAV data processing and mapping, and pasture modeling steps to allow for rapid output data that can be available near real-time.']"

Higher predation capacity of summerform C. chinensis was found than that of winterforms, shown as higher attack rate, shorter handling time as well as higher theoretical maximum number consumed by H. axyridis. We found that the stronger predation of H. axyridis on summerforms was likely due to the higher nutritional returns, e.g. higher protein content and less foraging costs when dealing with summerforms, smaller size, and softer and thinner exoskeleton. The high predation capacities of H. axyridis on both morphotypes of psyllids indicated its great potential as a biocontrol agent of C. chinensis. Based on the inverse density-dependent predation of type II functional response and the great predation capacities of H. axyridis on the two morphotypes, the control of C. chinensis should start early in the season to suppress the winterforms by inundative release. Further study of the control efficiency of two morphotypes of C. chinensis by H. axyridis in the field is necessary to extend our findings to on-farm pear psylla management.']"

By tailoring prevention and intervention efforts, such as screening for the significant correlates reported in this study, strides may be made to alleviate the preventable public health issue of food insecurity. The results of some of the associations with food insecurity are difficult to interpret (e.g., potential potective effect of lifetime substance use related to food insecurity) and require further study. The conceptual framework (Fig 1) suggests that coping and resilience are underlying features that warrant further investigation as potential explanatory mechanisms that could mediate or moderate food insecurity, substance use, and mental ill health in the context of different macro-level drivers and mental health, nutrition, and behavioural pathways. Longitudinal research and further investigations of coping and resilience may discern explanatory mechanisms that could mediate or moderate substance use, poor mental health, and food insecurity.

Our results show that along with BMI, waist circumference is related to higher earnings in Indonesia. The findings of this paper indicate that the alternative measures of body composition are important predictors of wage premium. A plausible explanation for our findings is that people with lower BMI, suffering from under-nutrition, face wage penalty and overweight people earn wage premium [21]. Reverse causality is also plausible i.e. getting a job increases income, which then makes it easier to buy food and gain weight.There are two important limitations regarding our results. First, the results are based on male individuals who are between 40 and 55. Therefore, we unable to generalize the results for the overall population. Second, we have only studied the association between measures of body composition and labor income.

The findings of our study support the adoption of preventive measures for HNC that encourage the consumption of minimally processed foods. Incentives may take the form of public education policies and address nutritional status control, oral hygiene, restriction of alcohol consumption, and cessation of tobacco use. The facilitation of access to minimally processed foods through public policies, such as subsidy provision for home and community gardens and free markets, is essential, and will strengthen the development and consolidation of policies that aim to create environments conducive to healthy behavior.']"

Cow and buffalo milk shows differences at fluorescence emission appeared at band position 382 nm, 440 nm, 505 nm and 525 nm both in classical geometry (right angle) setup as well as front face fluorescence setup. In front face fluorescence geometry, synchronous fluorescence emission shows clear differences at 410 nm and 440 nm between the milk samples of both these species. These fluorescence emissions correspond to fats, vitamin-A and β-carotene. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) further highlighted these difference by showing clear separation between the two data sets on the basis of features obtained from their fluorescence emission spectra. These results indicate that classical geometry (fixed excitation) as well as front face (synchronous fluorescence emission) of cow and buffalo milk nutrients could be used as fingerprint from identification point of view. This same approach can effectively be used for the determination of adulterants in the milk and other dairy products.']"

This decline has resulted in increased inputs (e.g., labor, expenses) by beekeepers to monitor and treat colonies in crisis, as well generates uncertainty in the supply of colonies for commercial pollination or other bee-derived products. In tandem with the recently sequenced genome of A. mellifera [48], an in vitro system comprised of honey bee cells will facilitate studies in functional genomics and/or target mechanisms of pathogenesis through infection with viruses, for example. Honey bees are also host to a plethora of non-pathogenic, horizontally acquired microbes [49]; a host-derived culture system could cast light on mechanisms of host tolerance and nutritional consequences of harboring these symbionts. In addition, the introduction of foreign gene constructs or knockdown of specific gene targets through RNA interference are attractive applications that would permit questions to be asked about subcellular and molecular changes involved with honey bee development or metabolic responses to pesticides and other xenobiotics.']"

We also show, however, that bumble bees may be somewhat resilient to a pulsed exposure because they exhibit dose-dependent recuperation of brood production when exposure ends. We acknowledge that to interpret the environmental relevance of our findings for wild bumble bee colonies additional studies are necessary. These should seek to establish whether recuperation from pulsed exposure to neonicotinoids occurs during extended exposures and for other demographically important endpoints besides brood production. Finally, the severity of imidacloprid's impact on bumble bees appears to be highly sensitive to its dietary level even within the currently recognized environmentally realistic range [21]. Unfortunately, this range is based on scant published data [56] and more widespread surveys of residues in crops and colonies, such as those recently begun in the USA [25], are therefore urgently required.""]"

The effects of the feed compositions used by different manufacturers onto the fish could be further understood by studying the global genes expression profile in greater detail. The expression level of fads6 and other genes was found to be potentially suitable as a bio-indicator to identify wild-caught Asian seabass from farmed ones. Goblet cell numbers in the mid-gut section of pellet-fed fish were lower than those of controls, indicating potentially negative effects on fish health. By considering the overall effects observed, we would recommend to farmers favouring feeds for the culture of Asian seabass that help to maintain the quality, not just increasing the quantity of the end product (i.e. the fillet).']"

Our work indicates that Antarctic marine sponges harbor a greater microbial diversity than the seawater around them, across the three domains. We found different community composition of symbionts compared to the surrounding planktonic communities, expanding previous observations for Bacteria and including the Antarctic environment. Finally, this work shows that even when sharing an important part of the microbial community with those from other ecosystems, Antarctic sponges have a particular signature in terms of their three-domain diversity and composition. Further functional analysis (e.g. metatranscriptomics), will provide the knowledge needed to fully understand the role that these specific microbiomes have as part of this important marine symbiosis in Antarctica.']"

Ages, length of stay in camp, low intake of egg and heme rich food sources were the predictors for the development of anemia among refugee adolescent girls.Based on the finding, UNCHR/WFP/ARRA will consider increasing the intake of heme iron food sources and vegetable gardening in order to enhance iron reach food intake in the households by taking the best practices of the hosting community.Also, the ongoing practice of conducting annual surveys of stakeholders (UNCHR/WFP/ARRA) among food aid beneficiaries of adolescent girls at least by using anthropometric and Hgb is important to monitor the prevalence.A health professional should consider providing health education and counseling based on age and menarche status.The high level of anemia had seen in long-term refugees argues in favor of further enhancements in food aid fortification or the option of cash transfer and the strengthening of nutrition and public health programs.']"
2018-04-19T00:00:00Z,Rich table but short life: Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis in Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) and its possible consequences,"['Previous studies of skeletal and hair remains of Tycho Brahe have ruled out the possibility that he died from a violent death (chronic poisoning) and excluded chronic long-term kidney disease and renal osteodystrophy, nutritional osteomalacia, vitamin D and calcium deficiency from gastrointestinal malabsorption syndromes, osteopenia, or osteoporosis [5]. The current paleopathological study provides further evidence about his health status, by revealing that he suffered from both diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis and obesity. These results, along with those of the isotopic analysis, give a glimpse into the lifestyle of the famous astronomer, revealing the dietary excesses a 16th century high-ranking individual could have afforded (high caloric intake and presumably excessive alcohol consumption). They also reveal the possible health consequences such a prestigious way of life could have had. Although this study does not allow a definite diagnosis to be reached, it highlights plausible reasons for the sudden illness and premature death of the famous astronomer, notably conditions resulting from so-called civilization diseases, which occur with high frequency in DISH patients.']"
2016-05-04T00:00:00Z,Inorganic Nutrients Increase Humification Efficiency and C-Sequestration in an Annually Cropped Soil,"['Findings of this field study are consistent with the findings of previous laboratory incubations [14,15], that an adequate supply of N, P and S can significantly increase the proportion of crop residue-C sequestered as FF-SOM-C. Our approach did not target primary plant productivity or C input (which was held constant) as the mechanism to improve C sequestration, but rather the humification efficiency of the soil microbiome as a whole, by deliberately manipulating the C:N:P:S ratio of added inputs. This explains the conundrum of the surprisingly low C sequestration under many long-term crop residue retention systems where the balance of nutrients is not considered along with C input. It also calls into question policies related to soil-C sequestration that do not account for the supply and value of the stabilising inorganic nutrients required, particularly if the sequestration is expected to occur deeper in the soil profile. In addition, current “nutrient-use efficiency” approaches to crop nutrition may inadvertently limit the supply of nutrients for the formation of new FF-SOM, by applying only sufficient nutrient for crop uptake. Furthermore, a lack of available nutrient supply following the addition of high energy C-rich crop residue may indeed exacerbate the mineralisation of pre-existing FF-SOM, via a priming effect, causing an overall net loss of FF-SOM. However, it must also be recognised that the nutrients need to be supplied in balance, otherwise those that cannot be sequestered into the FF-SOM pool may be prone to loss.Our methodology, based on the provision of supplementary inorganic nutrients to meet the stoichiometric ratio requirements of SOM to achieve a humification efficiency of 30%, was effective at increasing soil-C by up to 5.5 t C ha-1 over a five year period, and reversed a declining trend in soil-C that continued where supplementary nutrients were not applied. The mass balance suggests there was little if any nutrient loss from the system that could contribute to adverse environmental outcomes but further research is needed to quantify and validate this. The intensive cultivation used for incorporation did not preclude the sequestration of soil-C, as is often assumed, but rather assisted in the thorough mixing of soil to improve microbial contact with residue-C and nutrient sources. These observations also suggest a need for reconsideration of crop nutrition approaches in no-till farming systems, where crop residues remain on the soil surface, if increased C-sequestration is an expected outcome.We gratefully acknowledge an anonymous reviewer whose insightful comments which greatly improved the manuscript.']"
2015-07-31T00:00:00Z,"Experimental Barley Flour Production in 12,500-Year-Old Rock-Cut Mortars in Southwestern Asia","[""The Late Natufian ability to prepare flour in a significant quantity and quality may well point toward the production of unleavened bread, as this was a possible major product that could have been made from flour in the Late Epipaleolithic. Other meals (such as pancakes and donuts) could not have been prepared without portable vessels or ovens.The possibility that the Natufians consumed flour per se cannot be firmly ruled out; still we see it as being inconsistent the frequent appearance of the narrow conical mortar—which we have experimentally demonstrated to be an efficient peeling device—in Late Natufian sites, as flour can be eaten per se without de-husking the grains.It should also be stressed that the invention of bread was a significant dietary and nutritional advance that greatly improved human food quality. Bread was and still is a major source of grain nutrition (much more than flour, groats or porridge). Bread is a good source of carbohydrates and other nutrients and is easily digested; it can also be carried as provisions. Numerous sickle blades with typical gloss resulting from harvesting cereals have been recorded [29] in more than 80 years of research of Natufian sites; they have been replicated successfully in field experiments [30]. Thus, sickles, threshing floors, conical mortars and milling utensils (S1 Fig) [31] were significant inventions of the Natufian culture, all essential for exploiting wild cereals as an important source of carbohydrates.The technological advance from wide- to narrow conical mortars represented a major dietary change (S1A:1, S1F, S1C and S1D Fig). Meals and gruel made of husked or partly peeled ripe or unripe grains in the Early Natufian were supported in the Late Natufian by the production of flour from dehusked ripe grains and consequently the baking of unleavened bread. The dietary change from groat meals to barley bread, which probably occurred during the Late Natufian seems to have become wide spread in small villages such as Huzuq Musa and Qarassa 3 [32]. In fact, we estimated that the Huzuq Musa grain processing machinery could have produced sufficient barley bread to feed the site’s estimated inhabitants.The development of the narrow conical mortar facilitated Late Natufian people to produce what has become the Western world's most widespread staple food. The innovation of bread-making naturally followed the long-term consumption of dishes containing mainly small grains with the addition of some hulled large-grained barley [8]. With the development of a new agro-technological system, including threshing floors, peeling utensils and milling devices, the Natufians bequeathed to their Neolithic successors a technical advancement that contributed to the establishment of agricultural societies.""]"
2013-08-05T00:00:00Z,To Supplement or Not to Supplement: A Metabolic Network Framework for Human Nutritional Supplements,"[""One challenge in the application of FBA to study metabolism of multicellular organisms is choosing an appropriate objective function for the organism or tissue [9]. However, muscle tissue as compared to other tissues has more defined states, which we can be modeled: contraction and recovery/growth. Recovery from certain types of training leads to muscle tissue hypertrophy which is achieved by increasing the contractile proteins and scaffolding proteins in the muscle tissue. The contractile proteins differ slightly based on the muscle type: 1, 2a, 2x, and 2b. However, the amino acid composition of these proteins is similar enough that according to the model, amino acid supplementation effects protein synthesis equally (data not shown). This means that, similar supplementation regimes could be appropriate no matter the type of training goal. However, determining if there are differences between recovery and growth, one can slightly alter the objective function. For Type 1 muscle tissue (slow twitch), one could look at an objective function that would model increasing the concentration of mitochondria, while for Type 2 muscle tissue (fast twitch), the contractile protein synthesis may be more appropriate. To elucidate the differences even more, an objective function which incorporates a combination of mitochondrial proliferation and contractile muscle protein synthesis can be used to differentiate Type 2a, Type 2x, and Type 2b muscle tissues. Furthermore, the model predicts supplementation from fasting normo-aminoacidemia and post-absorptive states. These profiles were obtained by averaging the profiles of multiple individuals. Perhaps, by knowing the specific amino acids levels of an athlete or patient, one can use this model to predict an individualized supplement regimen appropriate for which muscle tissue recovery is desired. In addition, we use plasma concentration levels of amino acids as a proxy for amino acid flux. Differing concentrations can lead to differing results. Ultimately, we are looking at which uptake fluxes need to be increased to achieve the desired results. While our results are concurrent with literature, we can conceive that this can be used for personalized supplementations strategy. If we knew the concentrations and/or amino acid uptake fluxes of individuals, we can determine the most effective supplementation strategy to achieve the individual's objective.We also recognize that the model used here is less complex than previously published muscle models [9], [11]. However, our model was curated at the level of muscle cell metabolism and includes specific protein synthesis for contractile protein complex, while the other models do not. Yet, increasing the complexity by incorporating the specific protein synthesis into other published muscle models, can potentially allow us to investigate other nutrients and metabolites often used for supplementation. In addition, the model only investigates acute response to increasing the uptake flux and does not implement genetic controls, which can lead to increased muscle synthesis post exercise. However, these results are still pertinent because we make the assumption that the muscle tissue is primed for protein synthesis, and we ask under this state, increasing which amino acid uptake fluxes are necessary to take advantage of protein synthesis.This paper documents a novel and potentially important application for FBA. When looking at different nutrition, supplementation, and amino acid profiles, we gain a perspective on how this can affect the entire network. Not only did we predict amino acid supplementation and combinations that increased protein synthesis already found in literature, we showed that there can be various supplementation regimes that produce the same results but have differing metabolic landscapes. This gives us another tool to study nutrition and supplementation more effectively for promoting health. The results we obtained in this study can be considered as a proof of concept that introduces the prospect of using systems biology to investigate how supplementation and nutrition can affect human muscle metabolism. Clearly, additional work must be conducted both experimentally and computationally to refine the model and the perturbation protocols. The recent community efforts to build human tissue metabolic models would be very of great value for future work in this area, as well as conducting more detailed animal and human studies to validate the models and the predictions they make.""]"
2020-01-16T00:00:00Z,First adaptation of quinoa in the Bhutanese mountain agriculture systems,"['Quinoa, a new crop in Bhutan, has been successfully adapted and acclimatized in just over three years since its first introduction in 2015 to the unique mountain agriculture of this country in the Himalayas. Due to the versatile capacity of the crop to adapt to different growing conditions, quinoa has successfully adapted under the challenging mountain farming environments where different abiotic stresses, like varying precipitation patterns, drought, high temperature, frost and cold temperature, limit farmers’ choices of food crops and ability to ecological intensification of the cropping systems. The cultivation has been successfully demonstrated to the farmers across the country through on-farm demonstration and four varieties have been recommended with an indicative sowing time for the different agroecological zones and cropping systems. In the higher elevations above 1800 masl, spring sowing has been found most feasible. In these areas, a winter crop of quinoa after the harvest of main crops like potato and wheat has been partially successful but more research needs to be done for identifying genotypes and critical seeding time so that quinoa can escape frosts before anthesis. In the lower elevations below 1800 masl, sowing in autumn in the rainfed dryland, where quinoa is cultivated as a rainfed crop after the harvest of potato and maize, produced the best results. A winter crop after rice harvest in the terraced paddy fields is currently being evaluated with different genotypes. In this system, there is a need to identify suitable varieties with a growing period of less than 150 days, right sowing time and crop appropriate management practices.From a new crop in 2015, quinoa has already spread in all 20 Dzongkhags of the country and across all agroecological zones with an estimated area of about 500 acres in 2018 (200 ha). Quinoa is now aggressively being promoted as a climate resilient and a nutrient dense crop across the country in all the agroecological zones to enhance food and nutritional security, and as a potential niche organic crop for the regional export market (China & India).Quinoa is a new crop for the Bhutanese farmers and the overall understanding and management practices of this crop for their local mountain farming environments is still too poor for them. As the crop has not been previously evaluated in depth in this Himalayan region, the technical information available on quinoa is also scanty, and the basic information needed to judge agricultural activities to be done is very often partial or absent. Despite a high priority accorded to the promotion of quinoa cultivation, an all-out approach of the agriculture research and extension, to rapidly upscale the cultivation of quinoa at national level, is faced with numerous challenges. Among them, we can note limited access to quinoa germplasm [5, 52, 53], absence of best crop management practices under subsistence mountain farming systems, lack of knowledge on pest and diseases, harvesting and processing. Research and extension services of the Department of Agriculture have to face and address these challenges for consolidating the quinoa value chain. There is a need for package of practices for quinoa crop when grown under different agroecological conditions, organic production and marginal environments.The Department of Agriculture has initiated quinoa research and development in all 20 Dzongkhags to address the agronomic and seed related issues. Developing and implementing a long-term strategy and a program for managing quinoa cultivation and consumption on the principles of sustainable development imply to consider the whole agrifood system with a territorial approach. Being a new crop for Bhutanese people, the technical knowledge and awareness about quinoa’s nutritional benefits is very limited. Now, quinoa has been essentially introduced to enhance the food and nutritional security of the Bhutanese population by promoting it as nutritious health food, which requires its inclusion in the traditional cuisines through adequate research and demonstration efforts. In parallel with resolving agronomic issues [49], the absence of marketing channels to sell farmers’ small household surpluses, which is absent today, must be resolved.']"
2013-01-14T00:00:00Z,Population and Landscape Genetics of an Introduced Species (M. fascicularis) on the Island of Mauritius,"['Despite broader sampling, the results of this study were concordant with previous genetic investigations of cynomolgus macaques on Mauritus. While significant genetic differentiation among the 14 sampling sites was not found, individuals formed two clusters in the PCA that roughly corresponded to the northern and southern/central portions of the island, albeit with substantial overlap. The Fst between the two groups was low, and calculations of Fis were comparable, suggesting a consistent excess of homozygosity across the island.A higher correlation between genetic and geographic distance was found in sites on the northern portion of the island compared to the southern/central portion. This divide may be moderately affected by changes in topography, but topography alone does not adequately explain the differentiation between neighboring sites along the uniformly low-lying northern shore. Similarly, no significant difference in body weight at capture was found between animals in the northern and southern/central parts of Mauritius. We hypothesize that the increase in human habitation and tourist infrastructure in northern Mauritius since the 1980s has contributed to, if not created, this effect, as animals supplement their diets with food from anthropogenic sources, reducing both the travel distance required to secure adequate nutrition and contact with neighboring groups.']"

Remote sensing tools provide the opportunity to predict plant biomass and to study plant phenology in remote areas such as the Arctic, where it is difficult to collect plant data on a large spatial and temporal scale. In addition, by applying GWI (a metric derived from the NDVI time series) as a remote sensing tool to determine accurately the timing of high quality vegetation for herbivores (i.e. the date at which GWI reaches 50% of its maximum value), we were able to investigate how the geese from the three populations made use of the green wave during the three years studied. Remote sensing data, and NDVI in particular, are among the technological advances that are proving useful in studying large-scale movement ecology, and they have helped us gain a better understanding of how vegetation dynamics and distribution affect movement patterns in animal populations. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the migration of individual avian herbivores has been successfully studied with respect to vegetation phenology by using the satellite-derived green wave index.']"

The household living standards were consistently related to improved children's dietary diversity, but other sociodemographic variables impacted MDD-C differently in each country.In rural Rwanda and rural Burundi, part of the variability of the children's DD was explained by common characteristics of the communities the children lived in, which should be further explored to better understand the community effect.We encourage research on diet diversity using multilevel analysis to identify potential drivers at community level.Dietary diversification accounts for only one of the diet adequacy's dimensions. We recommend its inclusion in the strategies aiming to improve children's diet, by using an integrative approach which takes into account both the household's and the community's characteristics the children live in. More specifically we recommend the dissemination of educational messages on appropriate complementary feeding through popular communication channels like radio, TV or mobile phones interpersonal communications. At community level we recommend the implementation of practical trainings on the preparation of diverse complementary foods, as well as the improvement of the services provided by the nutritional centres in charge of community child growth monitoring.""]"
2019-09-05T00:00:00Z,Resource partitioning among brachiopods and bivalves at ancient hydrocarbon seeps: A hypothesis,"['The diversity patterns of brachiopods and chemosymbiotic bivalves at seeps through the Phanerozoic indicate an interesting combination of evolutionary trajectories. The diversity of infaunal chemosymbiotic bivalves at seeps mirrors their diversity in shallow-marine environments, whereas epifaunal and semi-infaunal chemosymbiotic bivalves are unique to vent and seep ecosystems and are not found in shallow water. Brachiopod diversity at seeps is unlike the global shallow-marine trend, is unrelated to the diversity of seep-dwelling bivalves, and instead indicates long-term coexistence of the two clades. Therefore, bivalves and brachiopods have probably not been competing for the same resources but instead partitioned the food sources resulting from the two most common categories of geofuels in seepage fluids: (i) hydrogen sulfide and (ii) methane and oil-derived components. Chemosymbiotic bivalves mostly relied on sulfide-oxidizing symbionts for nutrition, for the brachiopods bacterial aerobic oxidation of methane and of other hydrocarbons played a more prominent role. The distribution and availability of hydrogen sulfide and methane at seeps is governed by geochemical gradients and ocean chemistry, which in turn should ultimately have controlled whether bivalves or brachiopods dominated hydrocarbon seeps, both in space and through geologic time.']"
2019-07-09T00:00:00Z,‘A really good balance’: Thematic analysis of stakeholders’ views on classroom- and games-based positive choices interventions for primary school children,"['This study provided insights from the perspectives of children, parents, school staff and intervention staff into interventions delivering PSHE topics through a combination of classroom learning and physical activity.One of the main findings was that children engage in the interventions due to their enjoyment, particularly of the PA component of the sessions. Although the PA may be perceived as a reward for engagement in classroom learning, overall it appears that intervention participation has some degree of internal motivation [27], and it is reasonable to conclude that children might as a result be more receptive to programme messages than if they lacked personal control over their participation. The main benefits of the interventions were perceived to be improvements in knowledge, confidence/self-esteem, teamwork and–for the fitness and nutrition programme in particular–physical wellbeing, but no information currently exists for long-term outcomes and further investigation is recommended.On the whole, the current data indicate that the interventions were valued by stakeholders. Some suggestions were however offered for development of the programmes, including the addition of follow-up sessions and activities to be completed with parents, helping to support children’s outcomes through reinforcement of intervention messages over longer periods and in the home environment.']"
2016-06-01T00:00:00Z,An Analysis of Water Collection Labor among Women and Children in 24 Sub-Saharan African Countries,"['There is a critical need to reduce the amount of time that women and children spend collecting water. We suggest that accessibility to water, water collection by children, and gender ratios for water collection, especially when collection times are great, should be considered as key indicators for measuring progress in the water, sanitation, and hygiene sector. More work, however, is needed in order to test and potentially improve the validity of questions. For example, the number of trips a household makes per day should be added to national survey instruments to better determine water collection labor.Longitudinal research studies would be useful to better characterize how improving access to water infrastructure affects households’ opportunity costs, as well as nutritional outcomes and other health outcomes, including road casualties and assaults. Due to the limited research on water transport, current assessments made in the global burden of disease report do not include this as a risk factor in their analysis. If major investments are not made to address water collection labor, the problem could be heightened over time due to the increasing number of people predicted to live in areas with serious water shortages, many of whom are in sub-Saharan Africa.']"

This result is supported by the relatively low proportion of differentially expressed metabolism-related genes in the intestine and liver transcriptomes of juveniles. The present work largely confirms the results of previous studies performed over a shorter feeding period, especially with regards to changes in the expression of genes involved in the bioconversion of cholesterol and fatty acids. Our study shows that dietary-induced molecular and biochemical changes in lipid metabolism were maintained in the long term. In contrast, for several genes involved in protein catabolism, immunity and fatty acid catabolism we observed a differential regulation that could be related to the different developmental stages and/or to the differences in rearing temperature. We also characterize new molecular actors affected by the nutritional stress induced in the fish intestine by introducing plant ingredients in diets for rainbow trout, especially for genes involved in intestinal motility. Our results provide a framework for the development of new plant-based feeds to further reduce the reliance of aquaculture on marine fishery resources.']"
2017-10-20T00:00:00Z,The importance of propolis in alleviating the negative physiological effects of heat stress in quail chicks,"['The results of the present study indicate that dietary propolis supplementation can alleviate the negative effects of heat stress on the growth performance, intestinal histomorphometry, physiology and immunity of Japanese quail. Propolis maintained the normal levels of plasma free T3 hormone, preserved the integrity of intestinal villi and increased the crypts depth in the heat-stressed quail, which consequently enhanced the feed efficiency and growth performance of the quail. The plasma corticosterone and body temperature were decreased in the quail that were fed with propolis, indicating that propolis decreases the stress indicators in quail exposed to heat stress conditions. Moreover, the quail that were fed with propolis expressed good immunity status as presented by a lower H/L ratio and higher lymphocyte proliferation together with the high expression of TLR5 gene. Furthermore, the positive effects of propolis were evidenced by normalizing the high expressions of CASP6-apoptotic gene and Hsp70-stress gene to lower levels in the heat-stressed quail. Therefore, the addition of propolis at a rate of 1 g/kg to the diet of quail could be recommended as a potential nutritional strategy in order to improve their performance, especially under heat stress conditions.']"

In concordance with their biological function, nutrient metabolism was enriched in duodenum and jejunum, whereas enteric innate immune pathways were overrepresented in ileal Peyer's patches compared to the epithelium of intestinal segments. The results provide an expression map of different small intestinal tissues in healthy animals and improve our understanding of covariation between site-specific gene expression and site-specific functionalities along the small intestinal tract. These data collected on healthy animals could be of high value to study the alteration of the gene expression profile during inflammation and/or in infectious processes in pig intestine, as well as modifications associated with nutritional events, metabolic processes or genetic selection approaches. Therefore, the new challenge would be to identify gene expression patterns, but also potential gene biomarkers in the different intestinal segments that are significantly associated with performance, health or disease resistance.

Aellen as reaction to mild salinity","['In our study mild stress promoted content of secondary metabolites partly after a few hours, partly after several days. But in all cases the biomass reduction in plants grown in mild stress exceeded the increase in metabolite concentration in mildly stressed plants resulting in an equal or even lower yield of metabolites per cultivated area. Therefore, the total amount of secondary metabolites per harvest was lower in the stressed plants, except for proline. There might be other individual metabolites affected in the same way. So far, total (poly)phenol concentrations were taken into consideration, but analyzing individual valuable phenolic compounds is a promising future approach because single components might react to salinity. Salinity-affected soils occur all over the world. These lands are not suitable for conventional agriculture, but for saline agriculture. Species that can be grown in these environments are halophytes. It was shown that it is possible to manipulate their antioxidant concentration and enhance their value. As salt affected areas are a general problem already, halophytes can be grown on saline areas where glycophytic crops do not survive. Alternatively, halophytes could be cultivated in hydroponic greenhouse conditions by using brackish water to enhance their nutritional value.']"

Additionally, the study identified potential intra-species specific responses of citrus to Las, particularly an observation that Las-infection facilitates a down-regulation of defense-related proteins accompanied by a 128% increase in Zn concentration in lemon plants. An interesting find that might provide information on the potential biochemical mechanisms associated with the Las-induced responses in lemon plants, which have been previously shown to display a significant level of tolerance to Las. Thus, the information provided in this study has shed more light on the molecular and physiological mechanisms involved in host response to HLB, which could be applicable towards (i) development of citrus plants with reduced susceptibility to Las, (ii) development of more efficient nutritional management programs to control the disease, (iii) a broader understanding of plant-microbe interactions.']"

Clearly, further work is needed to test the microbial community in soil and to elucidate relationships among the soil microorganism, enzyme activity, nutrition, and crop growth and yield. Besides, soil sickness is a result of long term continuous cropping. Longer study periods and larger study plots will help get more convincing results.

An intriguing aspect of these social determinants is that they appear to be important for various kinds of diseases, ranging from obesity to autism. However, in Ghana, these social determinants are reported to be heavily linked to child mortality, nutritional status of children, completion of immunisation programmes, health seeking behaviour and hygienic practices. Although evidence on the influence of social determinants on the health of children has been documented over one and halif decades ago and some policies have been introduced to address these determinants, more policy changes and better implementation strategies are required. In designing a strategy to address this problem, stakeholders would have to recognise that social determinants are usually clustered into multiple interacting factors. We propose that developing a national child health policy agenda which supports families via both direct and indirect approaches would be crucial in addressing social determinants of health inequalities and improving child health outcomes in the country.']"
2015-08-17T00:00:00Z,Maternal Determinants of Birth Weight in Northern Ghana,"['On the whole, pre-pregnancy BMI and GWG were found to be the most important determinants of birth weight after controlling for gestational age. In most developing countries especially in Sub-Saharan African countries, counseling on appropriate weight gain in pregnancy during antenatal clinics and optimal nutrition before pregnancy for prospective mothers are mostly ignored. Since GWG is a modifiable risk factor, and recommendations exist for different BMI groups, it is important that emphasis should be placed on counseling and assisting pregnant women to stay within the recommended GWG range.Discussions about weight gain are especially important since approximately half of the mothers in this study had low GWG, which is associated with high risk of low birth weight. Beside this, a significant number of the women also had GWG above the recommended ranges and this is also considered to be a risk factor for macrosomic birth. A significant proportion of the pregnant women were over-nourished, which is a clear sign of the double burden of malnutrition currently experienced by developing and transition countries. Our findings especially on weight gain during pregnancy call for more research on factors that influence weight gain during pregnancy in Ghana.']"

Amikacin has been proven effective in disseminated infections or cases resistant to previous therapy. Renal and auditory evaluations are essential. Carbapenems are useful in some disseminated infections. Amoxacillin-clavunate can be used in some cases and during pregnancy.Most patients with eumycetoma are treated with either ketoconazole or itraconazole. Itraconazole 200–400 mg daily for 6 months is used to create a good fibrous capsule around the lesion, followed by wide local excision, continuing itraconazole 200–400 mg daily until cure is achieved. Cure is defined by the disappearance of the mass and all sinuses, normal ultrasound, and negative mycology findings. The decision to stop therapy is determined by complete sinus healing, disappearance of the eumycetoma mass clinically and radiologically by CT scan or MRI, and absence of the infecting agent. Other antifungal agents that can be used as second-line treatment include voriconazole and posaconazole.""]"
2020-01-10T00:00:00Z,Effectiveness of information technology–enabled ‘SMART Eating’ health promotion intervention: A cluster randomized controlled trial,"['The ‘SMART Eating’ intervention delivered using multi-channel communication approaches, was effective in improving dietary behaviours among urban adults from diverse socio-economic backgrounds. Context specific intervention strategies identified through formative research guided by Social Ecological Model and systematic development of the intervention guided by PRECEDE-PROCEED model, enabled significant net reduction in fat, sugar and salt intake, and significant net increase in fruit and vegetable intake in the intervention group. Availability of fruits and vegetables in the study area was one of the facilitating factors for improving the intake. The intervention was also successful in reducing weight, maintaining systolic blood pressure, reducing diastolic blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, and triglycerides. Overall, the study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of IT-enabled nutrition education intervention among urban population. The study indicated that it is possible to integrate efforts on changing multiple behaviours rather than focussing on single behaviour change. However, the effectiveness of this comprehensive intervention package, tested in a controlled setting, needs to be further explored through implementation research before its potential scale up.']"

While coastal communities had better childhood outcomes than some inland communities in Haiti, coastal proximity was not associated with improved outcomes in the Dominican Republic. We propose an additive conceptual model in which market distribution distance from the coastline determines the trends in child nutrition. Patterns of fish consumption support this model. The observed transition in the effects of proximity to natural resources with development partially supports Myers and colleagues [25] model in which the [rural] poor lag behind. However, even though coastal Dominican children lagged behind their inland counterparts, they still had improved outcomes compared to Haitian children. If other Caribbean countries serve as indicators, as development continues, fishing communities may continue to be buoyed up and escape poor and vulnerable conditions [70]. The role of biodiversity in mediating these trends remains unclear. Datasets of marine biodiversity at the scale of the DHS surveys will be needed to truly address this question. Currently, our insights are limited by incomplete and coarse data or the use of proxies.The research performed complies with the current laws of the country in which they were performed.']"

This approach avoids double-counting of environmental burdens. The approach was developed to be consistent with the AGRIBALYSE® database, which will allow future use of the ECOALIM dataset for feed formulation based on environmental impacts and environmental labelling of animal products. The ECOALIM dataset relies on representative and recent data that cover a wide range of production practices in France. Built with organisations such as feed manufacturers, raw material producers and R&D institutes, this dataset contains feed ingredients necessary to formulate complete feeds and several French feed ingredients for which no data were available before (i.e. sorghum, flaxseed, and soya bean). The ECOALIM dataset will allow feed formulas to be developed which incorporate nutritional, economic and environmental constraints. This new approach to designing diets needs further research to evaluate its potential as an option for mitigating livestock-related impacts. It would be interesting to conduct a similar study in other countries with the same degree of accuracy in LCI data of feed ingredients. The framework developed in the AGRIBALYSE® database and ECOALIM dataset is adequate to further develop such databases.']"
2016-02-19T00:00:00Z,Leaf Dynamics of Panicum maximum under Future Climatic Changes,"['Several levels of organization related to leaves will significantly affect P. maximum under future climatic change, at least in winter. Elevated temperatures and CO2, or their combination, will alter leaf morphology, development, phenology, and autotrophic/heterotrophic biomass partitioning. Leaf area-mass relationships will become linear as temperatures rise or develop a clear hyperbolic relationship with a limit below 3.0 g of dry matter per tiller under elevated CO2. With sufficient water and nutrients, elevated winter temperatures will result in higher leaf expansion and appearance rates. More green leaves and a higher leaf area and biomass per tiller will occur with rising temperatures if P. maximum grows free of drought and nutritional stresses in winter. Contrastingly, when combined with elevated temperatures, elevated CO2 will inhibit foliage formation by favoring biomass partitioning to stems or by speeding up leaf maturation. Despite the CO2-temperature synergism, elevated temperatures can partially offset the inhibitory effects of CO2 on leaf development and biomass partitioning, leading to a higher foliage area and biomass than in current atmospheric conditions. The significant changes in the mass-area relationship and nitrogen concentration in leaves under elevated CO2 will very likely alter, respectively, the leaf palatability and leaf functioning of P. maximum.']"

Both F. mosseae and R. intraradices inoculations could decrease Pb root-to-leaf translocation and thus protect the aerial parts of plants from damage. Additionally, AMF increased not only growth but alsophotosynthetic pigment content, leaf photosynthesis, and antioxidant enzyme activities of R. pseudoacacia, suggesting that AMF symbiosis could help host plant to cope with Pb toxicity. The lower H2O2 and MDA contents are associated with the protection of the photosynthetic apparatus of the mycorrhizal plants could be also observed in the current study (Fig 5). A model summarizing the roles of AMF inoculation in plant tolerance to Pb is presented in Fig 6. The effects of AMF symbiosis on physiological changes of plant aerial parts likely to be the results of different nutritional status, the alteration of hormonal balance and/or secondary metabolism, and the translocation of small signaling molecules [80], which needs to be further investigated. In addition, further studies are still required to reveal the interactions between AMF and indigenous soil microorganisms in phytostabilization and ecological stability in larger scales and under more complex environmental conditions.']"
2016-04-21T00:00:00Z,Children with Moderate Acute Malnutrition with No Access to Supplementary Feeding Programmes Experience High Rates of Deterioration and No Improvement: Results from a Prospective Cohort Study in Rural Ethiopia,"['Our results indicate that children with MAM during the post-harvest season in an area with no access to SFPs experience an unacceptably high incidence of SAM and a low recovery rate. This highlights the need to re-assess the current strategy for addressing MAM in these areas. The results suggest that the current approach of not having a targeted nutrition specific intervention to address MAM in this context place children with MAM at excessive risk of adverse outcomes. As the study was implemented during the best period for food security, we were not expecting such a high rate of deterioration and assumed that there would be sufficient food in households to ensure recovery from MAM, yet for close to half of these children this recovery did not happen. It is likely that if the study had been implemented during the hunger period, the rate of deterioration to SAM would have been even higher, with a concomitant increase in mortality. It is concerning to learn that such a high proportion of children with MAM will enter the next hunger season in such a vulnerable condition, with likely consequences of increased risk of SAM and death. Additional preventive and curative approaches should urgently be considered, particularly aimed at children with low MUAC, taking into account feasibility within the resource constraints of middle and low-income public health programming.']"
2019-07-16T00:00:00Z,Linking forest management to moose population trends: The role of the nutritional landscape,"['Our results indicate that variation in quantity of forage for moose across northern Idaho is likely correlated with moose population trends. These correlations indicate that forage might play an important role in limiting moose populations and contributing to population declines in our study region. Research linking forage conditions with foraging behavior, nutritional condition and fitness of individuals is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underpinning these relationships [12]. We recommend that future research on moose populations include consideration of the foraging landscape and its potential interaction with other population drivers. Failing to do so could result in misidentification of proximate population drivers as ultimate factors, and consequently, management actions that do not produce expected results. In addition, the relative importance of different population drivers, including forage limitation, predation, or climatic factors, is likely to change across time and space, stressing the need for data collection across large spatial scales and long timeframes. Our study highlights the importance of assessing how changes in land management across broad spatiotemporal extents affect wildlife and their habitats. This knowledge can be used in forest management to assess and prescribe disturbances (e.g., timber harvest and forest fires) required to maintain productive wildlife populations.']"

All agro-morphological data showed significant differences at p≤0.05 and p≤0.01 for all traits which shows the presence of diversification among the 42 coloured upland rice genotypes. Four groups were constructed using agro-morphological data clustering analysis. Yield contribution factors traits, which are yield per plant and harvest index, showed the highest value of heritability and genetic advance. Selection based on these traits can be done for further breeding programmes. Potential genotypes such as C, Chirikata 2, Ble Chu Cau, and IR 9669-PP 836–1, are recommended for selection and further evaluation in future breeding programmes. This is based on their molecular and agro-morphological information. These genotypes, selected from groups 2, 3, 4 and 5 from the SSR primer grouping, also have high grain per yield and harvest index values. For further studies, the evaluation of nutritional value of coloured upland rice can be done since red and purple bran may contain many phytochemical and neutraceutical functional foods.

The hidden hunger indices and maps illustrate both the burden of multiple micronutrient deficiencies and their contribution to the disease burden. They also provide a useful tool for advocates to illustrate the real need for multiple micronutrient interventions to address hidden hunger. In addition, they provide useful information for policy makers in decision making and prioritizing interventions, and offer valuable information for public health scientists as a basis for action, and the subsequent monitoring and evaluation of preventive programs.Of the 20 countries with the highest HHI-PD scores, 18 were in sub-Saharan Africa and two were in Asia. Stunting, iron deficiency anemia, and vitamin A deficiency were highly prevalent amongst preschool children in countries with the highest HHI-PD. The hidden hunger indices provide evidence for the appropriate targeting and prioritizing of comprehensive and inclusive nutrition programs which address global hidden hunger. The HHI-PD and maps also provide valuable information on hot spots where the prevalence of hidden hunger is alarmingly high, and where focused and scaled-up interventions are most critical to the attainment of the MDGs.']"

Tolerance was unaffected by the soil nitrogen status after two years of simulation. Because birch leaf production is highly plastic and exhibit compensation at moderate browsing pressure, it could provide a reliable forage resource for caribou. We still have to demonstrate whether higher leaf biomass translates into higher forage availability and what effect browsing has on forage nutritive quality. Lower forage availability could occur even under full compensation if the structure of the shrubs is modified. We also demonstrated the usefulness of the LRM, when assumptions are met, and we integrated the effect of browsing pressure in our predictions. On the other hand, we tested only one focal resource but birches could also be limited by water availability. Although B. glandulosa seems tolerant to periodic droughts, xeric drainage can be detrimental to the species [59]. Our results showed that caribou can decrease birch leaf biomass, thus with recent declines in caribou populations worldwide [64] the subsequent decline in browsing pressure could benefit the current shrub expansion [1].']"
2019-05-09T00:00:00Z,Trans-omics analyses revealed differences in hormonal and nutritional status between wild and cultured female Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica),"['In conclusion, that trans-omics analysis indicated that the ovulation problem, often observed in cultured female eels may be the result of a high-carbohydrate diet and/or a suboptimal DHA/EPA/ARA ratio in their diet. Interactions between nutrition and reproductive performance have been reported in domesticated animals [75–77], and poor reproductive performance has been reported in cultured broodstock compared to wild fish for several fish species [78–80]. The commercial diet for fish is generally designed to promote weight gain and/or fleshing out, regardless of the fecundity of the fish, and an optimized diet for broodstock culture is not commercially available. Future studies should therefore investigate more extensively the effect of diet on the reproductive performance of fish. The findings of the present study suggested several future experimental directions for the improvement of seed production efficiency, including establishing the effects of a high-carbohydrate diet on GH secretion, the effects of impaired GH secretion on the responsiveness to gonadotropins, the effects of lower Shbg levels on oocyte maturation, and the optimal dietary DHA/EPA/ARA ratios. The comprehensive data obtained in this study also demonstrated the usefulness of the omics approaches for understanding the functionality of diet components in aquaculture.']"

Additionally, since the caloric deficit was similar between the SUP and PLA groups but the fat loss was different, the supplements increased the efficiency (114% vs. 79%) of converting a caloric deficit into fat loss, thereby improving fat loss over diet alone by 35%. Since skinfolds were significantly reduced with supplementation and segmental DXA measurements were unchanged, the data suggest that the supplements were affecting the selective mobilization of fatty acids from subcutaneous fat depots for oxidation over visceral and other fat depots. It is recommended that future directions in research focus on isolating the specific contributions of each supplement to the improvements in body weight and body fat. Athletic, healthy women looking to rapidly reduce body fat with a focus on subcutaneous adipose tissue should consider adding supplements such as a thermogenic, CLA, protein gels/powders, and a multi-vitamin to their nutrition intervention as results may be significantly enhanced over diet alone.']"
2018-10-25T00:00:00Z,Xylose metabolism in the pig,"['In conclusion, pigs can metabolize xylose, but with considerably lower efficiency than glucose. Furthermore, pigs can adapt over time to utilize xylose more efficiently, as evidenced by the decline in the portion of dietary xylose excreted in the urine directly or as its metabolites. Xylose retention decreased from 60% to 47% to 41% when pigs were fed diets containing 2, 4, or 8% xylose, respectively. Thus, increasing dietary xylose concentration decreases diet ME. A comprehensive pathway for xylose metabolism in the pig is proposed and D-threitol was confirmed as the major urinary metabolite of xylose. Xylitol, D-xylonic acid, and D-xylulose were identified as minor metabolites.This experiment provides novel data regarding xylose metabolism when fed at relevant concentrations for typical swine diets. To fully understand these data in the context of practical swine nutrition, further research is needed to determine how much free xylose is released from arabinoxylan with xylanase supplementation. Because of the importance and cost of energy in swine diets, assigning an energy release value to xylanase is of great interest. These data indicate that xylose’s energy contribution to the pig will depend on the amount of xylose released and the length of adaptation to the diet.']"
2013-10-18T00:00:00Z,Diverse Microbiota Identified in Whole Intact Nest Chambers of the Red Mason Bee Osmia bicornis (Linnaeus 1758),"['From a microbial perspective, Osmia females create brood cell microhabitats that resemble to a large part the surrounding environmental characteristics due to passive transport of bacteria from various sources into these nests. In contrast to plant-associated bacteria, those of soils seem to be able to flourish and dwell within the compartment walls between nest chambers. The resulting community is very diverse and may be composed of a patchwork from different collection sites. They may further be highly variable according to differences in soil characteristics of the bioregion and individual bee collection behavior.From a bee perspective, the brood cell environment is very different from the controlled microbial system inhabited by honey bee colonies. This diversity of microorganisms may cause severe larval mortality and require specific physiological or symbiotic adaptations against microbial threats. They may however also profit from such a diverse environment through gain of mutualistic partners. These microbiological conditions require further attention as they are likely of great importance in bee offspring nutrition, development, and immune-response to multiple threats. We conclude that further studies of microbial interaction networks in solitary bees will help to explore so far unknown fitness components and will improve the understanding of driving factors of population dynamics.']"

E. coli O157:H7 could survive for 32.79±1.16 days in neutral soils, and only 6.5±1.34 days in acidic soils. Special attention should be paid to the different survival times of E. coli O157:H7 in acidic and neutral soils when evaluating the environmental risk associated with it. The survival of E. coli O157:H7 in soils might relate to the interactions between numerous physical, chemical and biological factors. Our findings suggested that high soil pH and organic carbon could prolong E. coli O157:H7 survival times (td), while the initial G−/G+ ratio and exchangeable K were negatively correlated with survival times. Soil pH governs the fate of E. coli O157:H7 directly and indirectly through the adsorption/desorption of soil minerals, nutrition availability, and metal toxicity. However, the experiment was carried out under laboratory conditions. In order to better understand the survival dynamics of E. coli O157:H7 and provide precise information to assess the possible risk of contamination by this pathogen, further research should be done under natural conditions.']"

We found that while the muscle is a site of structural energy, the liver has an even higher energy density than whale blubber and serves as a storage unit to fuel white shark migrations, growth and reproduction. Among-individual variation in fatty acid profiles suggest individuality in foraging strategies with some sort of a gradient between dominant or partial consumption of fish and mammals. Such information, although currently very limited in elasmobrachs, is required for the development of bioenergetics-based models including dynamic energy budget models and ecosystem models increasingly used in fisheries and conservation management. Indeed, measuring total lipid energy is appealing because lipids represent a common currency, linking food quality and quantity to many aspects of fish nutrition, reproduction and population dynamics. Future studies should include targeted sampling and utilization of this novel approach on live specimens, along with ongoing telemetry studies, to explore the relative contributions of biological and environmental factors influencing intra-specific variation. Such data will allow us to better understand the ecology of white shark and predict how they might respond to environmental perturbations.']"

The findings show that residing in households with a poor socio-economic status, drinking water from unprotected water bodies, having mothers who are HIV-positive, and being born to uneducated mothers are significant risk factors for mortality across both age groups (infant, and under-five) in rural South Africa. There is cause for hope in being able to achieve the SDG 2030 targets in South Africa, for reducing child mortality, which requires good nutrition, safe water, adequate sanitation, good hygiene, and reduced HIV infections. However, much needs to be done to further reduce mortality in these vulnerable age groups. The results highlight the need for a more comprehensive approach to child health intervention programmes towards reducing child mortality in rural SSA. Such policies need to include improvements in socio-economic status, health services, educating mothers, accessibility to clean water sources as well as improving the control of HIV and other preventable diseases. In addition, intervention policies need to embrace comprehensive child feeding guidelines and communication strategies in order to reduce under-five mortality, especially HIV-related deaths.']"

In this study maternal coffee consumption and hookworm infection during pregnancy are key predisposing factors to maternal anemia. Hence, a more comprehensive and community-wide deworming intervention should be performed. All pregnant women coming to antenatal clinics should be screened and treated routinely for intestinal parasitic infection. Anti‑helminthes should be given as prophylaxis to adolescent and young adult women, before their reproductive career. Stool analysis and nutrition intervention should be strongly inculcated into the routine maternity services during antenatal care. We also suggest sustained health education on the dietary intake, access to health care, clean water, hygiene and sanitation for women of reproductive age group particularly, pregnant women. Iron-folate supplementation combined with de-worming will also have affirmative input. The inhibiting effects of coffee on iron absorption can be partially prevail by the concurrent intake of vitamin C rich foods and diet of animal origin. Moreover, pregnant women should limit coffee consumption, and avoid drinking coffee with meals. Causal relationships between maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy and anemia should be further investigated with strong study design.']"
2012-10-03T00:00:00Z,"Earliest Porotic Hyperostosis on a 1.5-Million-Year-Old Hominin, Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania","[""The observation of porotic hyperostosis on the 1.5 Ma OH 81 child indicates early childhood was also nutritionally stressful for hominins, even well before the establishment of the sedentary, food-producing societies of the Holocene, and it also dispels the notion of invariable dietary affluence in the early Pleistocene. And, based on other pathological hominin fossils from more recent in time, the Pleistocene continued to be a stressful period for some hominin populations, in some places. For instance, cribra orbitalia, a specific form of porotic hyperostosis, affects one third of the Atapuerca (Spain) Middle Pleistocene Sima de los Huesos (Bone Pit) population [47].Stratigraphically, OH 81 was recovered from the lower portion of upper Bed II of the Olduvai Formation, in which a geologically documented drying trend ultimately resulted in the disappearance of the Olduvai paleolake by late upper Bed II times [48]. This evolving climatic upheaval might have contributed to resource scarcity and nutritional stresses for Olduvai hominins. Thus, although archaeological evidence (in the form of stone tool butchery damage on ungulate fossils) [38] confirms the importance of meat-eating in human evolution, the same evidence weighed against nutritionally relevant paleopathological data, such as those for OH 81, reveals a more realistically nuanced picture of our prehistory.Further broader relevance of anemia-induced porotic hyperostosis on OH 81 is its support for hypotheses that meat-eating was a fundamental, rather than marginal, aspect of some hominin diets during the early Pleistocene [38], [49]. There is disagreement, but a compelling body of data suggests [50]–[54] that extant chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) might eat meat to compensate for seasonal shortfalls in protein and/or important micronutrients [55]. Despite the possibility that chimpanzees are at least seasonally obligate faunivores, porotic hyperostosis is virtually absent in these apes, our closest living relatives. In contrast, the pathology's relative prevalence in prehistoric hominins seems to indicate that a significant deriviation in hominin metabolic physiology from the ancestral condition occurred sometime after the late Miocene split between the hominin and panin lineages. The presence of anemia-induced porotic hypertostosis on the 1.5 Ma OH 81 hominin parietal, indicates indirectly that by at least the early Pleistocene meat had become so essential to proper hominin functioning that its paucity or lack led to deleterious pathological conditions. Actualistic studies on the ecology of scavenging show that this strategy is feasible only on a seasonal basis in some modern East African savannas and that it provides low flesh yields [56], [57]. A physiology adapted to the consumption of meat on a regular basis, as inferred for the species to which OH81 belonged, is in contradiction with this scenario, since it would not survive acquiring flesh so sporadically. This grants more support to the hypothesis that some hominins were actively engaged in hunting by 1.5 Ma.Because fossils of very young hominin children are so rare in the early Pleistocene fossil record of East Africa, the occurrence of porotic hyperostosis on one, OH 81, suggests we have only scratched the surface in our understanding of nutrition and health in ancestral populations of the deep past.""]"
2019-10-01T00:00:00Z,Multilevel legal approaches to obesity prevention: A conceptual and methodological toolkit,"['Public health law research and scholarship continues to focus on measuring the effects of a wide range of state laws on population health [55]. Recent studies have considered the effects of everything from medical marijuana legalization to seat belt safety laws [56–58]. While these studies and previous work on obesity prevention laws often make reference to the ecological model of health behavior change, they have not systematically linked this model to the laws under investigation. Moreover, the focus is generally on a particular ecological level, such as schools. In this paper, we presented a conceptual framework that allows for the classification of obesity laws based on the ecological level of influence and the underlying legal mechanism involved. This creates the capacity to develop theory-driven models of the effects of various combinations of legal techniques and environment modification. This is an important first step in the direction of identifying legal interventions that are most likely to reduce obesity prevalence and increase health-promoting behaviors.Our classification system and search reveals that no obesity laws enacted during the study period specifically targeted the interpersonal level of influence. This is an important finding because it shows that a domain critical to shaping obesity-related behaviors and habits was not the target of substantial policy activity. Although changing dietary practices in the home is likely to be an essential component of any policy intervention that successfully reduces obesity rates over the long term, lawmakers may find it particularly challenging to develop politically feasible and socially acceptable interventions at this ecological level. Proposed amendments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) that would restrict the purchase of foods that do not meet certain nutritional standards provide an example of how a legal mechanism that decreases access to obesogenic foods might target the home environment indirectly [59]. Ultimately, efforts to quantify the effects of any current or proposed interventions must continue to evolve with a focus on linking laws to health outcomes with a solid theoretical model of health behavior change.Our findings of extensive adoption of physical activity standards, physical education standards, and walk and bike path legislation are consistent with prior studies of the state-level obesity policy landscape [60–63]. Our finding that the majority of states do not have a comprehensive package of obesity prevention laws that targets multiple ecological levels of influence on youth obesity raises important questions about how obesity policy is developed on the state level as even more recent data collection efforts reveal that multilevel legal approaches within states are rare. Several studies [61–64] have sought to identify state-level socioeconomic, political, or population health factors that shape adoption of obesity prevention laws. Political factors such as a democratically controlled legislature and a longer legislative term are both associated with increased likelihood of bill enactment. State legislative action on obesity was also more likely in states with a greater gap between adults’ actual and desired weight, a higher percentage of college-educated adults, and a higher percentage of African-American residents [65]. However, adult obesity prevalence was generally not a significant predictor of bill enactment [65].In order to create the potentially synergistic effects of multiple obesity prevention laws, state policymakers should continue to create and enact legal interventions that target different ecological levels of influence on youth obesity. Expanding opportunities for recreation through walk and bike path development is an important first step to encourage healthier lifestyle choices. However, it does not go far enough in addressing the multiple environmental determinants of obesity. There is a glaring lack of legal interventions that directly target the intrapersonal and interpersonal ecological levels; this highlights the need for laws that will change food and physical activities practices within the home and provide individuals with more opportunity to change their physical activity and food practices independently. For example, restricting the use of supplemental nutrition assistance benefits to healthy foods, providing benefits that cover the cost of using local gym facilities for families or individuals, or increasing individual access to obesity treatments through public or private insurance mechanisms are policy options that would start to fill the existing gap. Future research might examine the scope and content of the evidence base for successfully adopted obesity prevention laws in an effort to bridge the gap between obesity research and law. The absence of more comprehensive combinations of obesity prevention laws may limit the potential of legal interventions to help solve this pressing public health issue.']"
2017-08-22T00:00:00Z,A systematic review of sub-national food insecurity research in South Africa: Missed opportunities for policy insights,"[""The experience of food insecurity found in this review was characterised by issues affecting the ability of individuals and households to access sufficient food. This resonated with–and expands on—the shift in food security ‘paradigms’ narrated on in the 1990s by Maxwell, who observed that since the 1970s the focus in analysis and programming has moved from being on national production deficits to being orientated towards the consumer, at the level of household and individual livelihoods and capabilities (see [181]). These shifts have also seen the commensurate change in the way food security is measured, and how best to do so has been the subject of scholarly debate for some time [37, 182].The use of 27 different measurement tools across the 169 studies is indicative not only of the different disciplinary backgrounds of the authors but also of the difficulty in establishing an absolute ‘state' of food insecurity that is comparable across space and time. Some approaches focussed on measuring food security through a composite food access index, others on quantifying micro- and macro-nutrient intake, and still others on malnutrition outcomes such as stunting. This makes a direct comparison of relative food insecurity across the studies very difficult.A wide range of food insecurity drivers was cited across the studies, with each study reflecting local level, context-specific dynamics. Nevertheless, the very high reliance on purchased food means that being able to afford food is the predominant challenge in South Africa, with 51% of studies specifically citing poverty as a food insecurity driver. Food prices are a cause for concern and discussion. In the light of poverty, there is a high dependence on government grants, which is seen as preventing households from falling into absolute hunger, but may be a disincentive to engaging in more sustainable food security efforts, such as food gardens. This is resonant with the kinds of trade-offs involved among the food insecure, in which coping strategies frequently have short as well as long-term negative impacts on livelihood resilience.Food production is beset with access-related issues including affordability of agricultural inputs, poor access to farm and non-farm resources, and failing or exclusionary formal and informal institutions. Given these challenges, it is perhaps not surprising that deagrarianisation emerged as a theme in the studies. Deagrarianisation also takes place in the context of a rapidly urbanising world. Urban food systems were discussed by some studies.The exclusionary practices of formal and informal institutions were repeatedly raised in relation to agriculture and other aspects of food access. Access to social resources was particularly mentioned in relation to gender dynamics, which disadvantage women in myriad ways in the food security landscape.The so-called nutrition transition creates a (relatively new) dimension to food insecurity, and one that is linked to markets and food availability, food choices and nutrition, as well as food access. This transition sees a move towards the increasing consumption of cheaper, more available, and/or preferable ‘globalised’ foods, which have a high-energy content but generally low nutritional value, and which are heralding overweight and obesity alongside features of malnutrition such as stunting. However, all of the food security issues raised in the studies, are components of a food system that has multiple ailments but also multiple opportunities.A high level of local specificity in the causes, experience and consequences of food insecurity in South Africa is evident from the reviewed research. Decision-makers need to consider the local level context in developing and implementing interventions. From an operational perspective, the ‘how’ of interventions- their process- matters at least as much as their ‘what’. Misselhorn’s framework for intervention processes incorporates social capital, participation, coordination, and learning interactions as essential elements in food security interventions [183].The study highlights the need for paying more attention to what we are measuring and being precise in how food insecurity is measured. While there are no agreed on measures internationally, it is important for the food security research community and national departments entrusted with monitoring and evaluation of food security (primarily the Departments for Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation; Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries; Health; Rural Development and Land Reform and Statistics South Africa) to confer and agree on a minimum set of indicators, methodologies and the interpretation of these indicators for reporting in more consistent ways. The wealth of sub-national surveys could provide additional rich understandings of local and household level experiences of food security and informed evidence for more appropriate policy making and designing of intervention programmes. Policymakers at all spheres of government (national, provincial and municipal) should be engaging with this wealth of researchers and sub-national study findings to enrich their food security planning, monitoring, and evaluation.""]"
2016-09-26T00:00:00Z,Taxes on Sugar-Sweetened Beverages to Reduce Overweight and Obesity in Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Review,"['This review assessed nine studies, including three quasi-experimental studies, and four non-experimental, and two modeling studies. While these studies alone were insufficient to draw strong conclusions about the effectiveness of an SSB tax in improving obesity outcomes in MICs, the review indicates that a tax on SSBs may be a promising policy for MICs to consider in the face of the growing burden of overweight and obesity. A tax on SSBs will increase prices of soda, if not other SSBs, where markets are consolidated. The price increase required to prevent further growth in the prevalence of obesity and overweight varies across MICs, with most needing at least a 20% increase. The review also suggests that the tax alone will not likely lead to reductions in energy intake that are large enough to affect permanent reductions in population weight. The evidence base remains insufficient to definitively determine whether taxing SSBs will be more or less effective in MICs versus high-income countries, though it does indicate that differences will unlikely be large. MIC governments may want to consider adjusting existing surveys to create opportunities for stronger research and evaluation. They may also want to consider including type-2 diabetes as an outcome so that the indicators reflect a holistic understanding of the nutritional needs in MIC populations. They may also consider implementing the tax with other obesity prevention interventions.']"
2012-06-29T00:00:00Z,"Wealth Status, Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) and Antenatal Care (ANC) Are Determinants for Low Birth Weight in Kersa, Ethiopia","['The percentage of newborns delivered having LBW was extremely high in this study. The significant predictors of LBW were being poor, not attending ANC, MUAC less than 23 cm, experience of physical violence during the index pregnancy and longer time to walk to health facility. This is significant because LBW is highly associated with neonatal and infant morbidity and mortality.Improving access to health care and improving the nutritional status of women particularity pregnant women would reduce the occurrence of LBW.In Ethiopia, all rural Kebeles are staffed with health extension workers; these health workers are expected to provide house to house health promotion services. In this regard, they should emphasize providing ANC for the pregnant women. Through ANC, it is possible to identity a women who are at risk of having LBW baby. Giving necessary advice such as the need for balanced diet and provision of health promotion intervention such as provision of iron tables for the anemic can be easily facilitated.In addition, empowering women, families and neighborhoods to work on their own health care such as peer discussion to use ANC, would reduce the number of babies borne having LBW. These activities would prevent not only the occurrence of LBW but also problems associated with LBW such as child morbidity and most importantly child mortality thereby helps the country achieve child MDG targets.']"
2007-01-16T00:00:00Z,When Is Replacement Feeding Safe for Infants of HIV-Infected Women?,"[""Current research in prevention of breast-milk HIV transmission includes evaluation of a variety of approaches, including optimizing exclusive breast-feeding, providing antiretrovirals during shortened breast-feeding to mother or infant, and, ultimately, vaccination. Preserving breast-feeding is attractive because of nutritional, growth, safety, and confidentiality issues, and in the future these approaches may enable prolonged breast-feeding. However, some of the interventions currently under study may not be as promising as initially envisioned. For example, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) during shortened breast-feeding is not the panacea hoped for—it may be associated with loss of confidentiality, toxicity, resistance, and infant morbidity and growth compromise when breast-feeding is stopped at six months. It is plausible that strategizing for not breast-feeding from birth would be less problematic than first starting to breast-feed on HAART, and then stopping after six months. Thus, replacement feeding should still be considered in the mix of strategies to prevent breast-milk transmission of HIV, particularly when water safety is assured and provision of breast-milk substitutes is an option. Becquet et al's data are reassuring that when appropriate support is provided and clean water is available, replacement feeding can be safe in an urban African setting.""]"
2017-10-05T00:00:00Z,Entomopathogenic fungi-based mechanisms for improved Fe nutrition in sorghum plants grown on calcareous substrates,"['The three EPF strains used in the in vitro assay increased the Fe availability under different conditions with respect to the Fe source (three Fe oxides of different crystallinities and solubilities) and growing substrate (calcareous or non-calcareous). Metarhizium brunneum was the most effective fungus, seemingly as a result of its increase of the Fe availability by releasing organic acids to lower the pH of the calcareous media. Both B. bassiana and M. brunneum alleviated the Fe chlorosis symptoms in inoculated sorghum plants grown on an artificial calcareous substrate. Although the three inoculation methods used in this experiment had positive effects on the plants, the soil treatment was the most effective method. Thus, it resulted in the increased persistence of the fungus in the substrate (CFU), re-isolation from different plant tissues to an extent comparable to that of seed dressing, a more persistent effect on the chlorophyll concentration of young leaves and plant growth relative to the other two inoculation methods, and a similar ability to increase the Fe uptake by sorghum plants. As revealed by the root parameter values, the soil treatment also resulted in a better exploration of the substrate. Therefore, the inoculation method is a key factor to consider in designing sustainable agricultural strategies based on EPF. The results of this work expand on the existing knowledge of plant-EPF-soil relations, and they underscore the importance of the inoculation method and the use of EPF to improve plant Fe nutrition in calcareous substrates beyond their role as biocontrol agents.']"
2016-08-25T00:00:00Z,"A Look into the Cell: Honey Storage in Honey Bees, Apis mellifera","['Variation in ripening dynamics within and between individual cells might reflect the outcome of storer bees’ behavior to work around the spatial and biophysical constraints to nectar ripening. The reorganization of stores to concentrate nectar into honey and the coordination with other colony functions, such as brood rearing [37], is achieved via cell content relocation. This process led to the overall increase of filling level in a high number of storage cells, of which the content concentration eventually reached that of honey. Ripening dynamics showed intercolonial variations that might be explained by internal factors (e.g. genetics, variations in humidity within the hives [12]). In conclusion, our data provide evidence for the occurrence of both passive and active mechanisms involved in honey production and confirm previous hypotheses based on behavioural observations [5,10,11]. Given the high resolution and non-destructive property of the method used, we were also able to describe previously unknown phenomena of nectar processing and honey production at the individual cell and comb levels (e.g. within cell heterogeneity of content and their dynamics over time). A combination of diagnostic radioentomology and detailed behavioral observations under a range of natural conditions will help to further advance our understanding of the ripening and storing of honey according to the colony’s nutritional and environmental contexts and contribute to improving beekeeping management.']"
2017-05-12T00:00:00Z,The malleable gut microbiome of juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss): Diet-dependent shifts of bacterial community structures,"['The intestinal microbiome is substantially involved in metabolism, and increasing plant protein levels in fish feed are significantly affecting this microbiome. This study has furthermore demonstrated that the intestinal microbiome of Rainbow trout can adapt several times towards a given diet and that the diet-type modulates this adaptation. Thus nutritional programming mechanisms of diets on the bacterial community could not be detected—within the presented experimental setup. Early fry feeding with plant proteins will therefore not positively influence the relation between the intestinal microbiome and plant proteins fed in later life stages. However, early fry feeding with fishmeal (representing the current state of work) will certainly not affect the subsequent replacement with plant proteins as well. The phyla and orders found in this experiment agree very well with bacteria that have been found in previous studies and thus the idea of a trout specific core microbiome on higher taxonomic levels is still valid. However, a comparison of the core microbiome in the present study with data from previous results suggests that on lower taxonomic levels diet has a strong modulating effect. These findings should therefore play a key role in further research about fishmeal substitution by including specific bacterial strains commonly present in the GI tract of trout into digestibility analysis.']"
2016-11-09T00:00:00Z,Plasma Ghrelin Concentrations Were Altered with Oestrous Cycle Stage and Increasing Age in Reproductively Competent Wistar Females,"['Significant changes were detected in total ghrelin concentrations in fed and fasted plasma, but not in stomach tissue, during different stages of the oestrous cycle in Wistar rats, along with observed decreased fasted stomach contents at oestrus. Fasted plasma ghrelin concentration increases were only observed in matched fed samples when rats were transitioning from oestrus to metoestrus on consecutive days. Circulating ghrelin levels were significantly reduced by 37 weeks of age in rats in both fed and fasted conditions. The biological implications of these findings are yet to be established in reproductively active animals, but warrant further investigation into ghrelin regulatory factor changes with increasing age in reproductively competent female mammals. If replicated in humans, the response to feeding, and higher circulating concentrations of total ghrelin in younger adult females, have the potential to influence the findings and interpretation of other studies, potential drug treatments, and surgical interventions. Future studies would need to factor ovarian cycle stage and age-related ghrelin regulatory changes into their experimental design and data analyses. Likewise, with the shift towards older human mothers with potentially altered concentrations of appetite-influencing hormones, producing their first children later in life, may also affect development in utero and post-partum nutrition, thus the metabolic programming of future generations.']"
2015-01-28T00:00:00Z,Trehalose Is a Chemical Attractant in the Establishment of Coral Symbiosis,"['We have found that in the symbiotic relationship between corals and Symbiodinium, fixed carbon in the form of trehalose produced by the symbiont plays a key role in how these partners find each other. This signal may yield information about the nutritional status and potential fitness of the signal generator and may serve the critical role of attracting the partners towards one another, where further information, in direct cell-cell interactions, can then be exchanged. Given that a likely benefit of horizontal infection is the identification of symbionts best suited to a particular environment, the trehalose cue, reflecting photosynthetic capability, may be particularly important to a potential host.Symbiosis between coral and intracellular dinoflagellates is critical for coral viability and reef ecosystem productivity. Most larval coral take up symbionts from their environment; but how these symbiotic partners signal and sense one another has been unknown. To help solve this mystery, we demonstrated in F. scutaria coral and their Symbiodinium: 1) a release of the disaccharide trehalose into the environment by the symbionts, 2) a coral larval chemo-attraction and feeding response in the presence of trehalose, 3) the presence of the enzyme, trehalase, in coral tissue, but not in the symbionts, and 4) adult release of live Symbiodinium, thus seeding the reef. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a specific chemical cue attracting the motile coral larvae to the symbiont.']"
2014-10-07T00:00:00Z,New Insights into How Increases in Fertility Improve the Growth of Rice at the Seedling Stage in Red Soil Regions of Subtropical China,"['The present study investigated reasons that increasing soil fertility would enhance the growth of rice. The study adopted a new perspective focusing on rice root ROL and its corresponding soil oxygen profile. The fertile soil had high porosity (because of the low clay content) and a high NH4+ content, which supported soil nitrification. A high rhizosphere oxygen pressure distribution caused by the rice root ROL, which was attributed to the improved rice root growth and root porosity observed in the high-fertility soil, also contributed to the promotion of rhizosphere nitrification. The mechanism accelerating the development of rice root aerenchyma in the high-fertility soil requires further exploration. Investigation of the mechanisms of N loss and the quantification of N loss were not performed in this study but will be addressed by our laboratory in future research. Long-term tillage and fertilisation (especially organic fertiliser) would significantly increase soil fertility, but a large amount of organic matter would decrease the soil oxygen content. Fortunately, rice planting altered the water layer and soil oxygen status via root ROL, and rice in the fertile soil further improved the rhizosphere soil oxidisation environment. Our results suggest that increased fertilisation could lead to increased soil aeration in red soil regions in China, which might promote rice growth and rice N nutrition.']"
2016-01-06T00:00:00Z,Drought-Stressed Tomato Plants Trigger Bottom–Up Effects on the Invasive Tetranychus evansi,"['Our data reveal that both drought and T. evansi infestation induced significant changes in the nutritional quality of tomato plants, as more essential amino acids and free sugars are available. These changes trigger a bottom-up effect on key biological traits of T evansi causing a highly significant increase of leaf damage and mite performance. Plant defense proteins were also induced by drought and/or mite infestation, but the mite physiological responses suggest that T. evansi is capable of circumventing their potential adverse effects. These findings support the “Plant stress hypothesis” and suggest that drought-stressed tomato plants even at a mild level may be more prone to T evansi outbreaks in a climate change scenario, which might strongly affect tomato production on area-wide scales. Moreover, abiotic stresses can also exert a strong impact at higher tropic levels. Thus, it has been demonstrated recently that plant water status may also trigger bottom-up effects on the reproductive behavior and fitness of some natural enemies, especially the omnivorous predators [51, 52], which might shape the arthropod structure. Therefore, this complexity of food-web structures should be considered when using species distribution models to infer climate change effects on crop pests.']"

G-HypoT possible influenced the human whey proteome of colostrum, decreasing metabolic and cell-structure proteins and increasing immunity-related proteins, which may affect the transportation of nutrition and bioactive components for infants. We found that theduration of jaundice was longer in infants of G-HypoT (50±14.1) mothers than no-G-HypoT(30±17.3) mothers. But there was no difference in infant birth length and weight between the two groups. May be a more large sample will show difference, or therapy relief hypothroidism influence on mothers and thus the milk. So influence of alteration caused by G-HypoT may need a period to make difference on clinical characteristics of infant health. Since our sample size was small, large prospective cohort studies should be performed to verify our findings. The impact of maternal gestational hypothyroidism on infant growth index and nutrient status should also be taken into account, along with changes in milk components during the course of lactation. The present study provides insight into proteomic differences in the colostral whey of G-HypoT women in comparison to non-G-HypoT women.']"
2019-11-27T00:00:00Z,Risk factors for the carriage of Streptococcus infantarius subspecies infantarius isolated from African fermented dairy products,"['This study provides the first data on SBSEC/Sii prevalence in the general population. Our findings allowed confirmation of earlier observations regarding determinants, especially demographic, environmental and nutritional factors that might influence the fecal carriage of SBSEC members. Such data was previously only obtained from hospital-based studies and was thus less representative for the general population. We noted a significantly higher rate of Sii fecal carriage in elderly, in consumers of artisanal butter, as well as in subjects in close contact with livestock and livestock primary products. The livestock proximity has been identified as a risk factor for Sii fecal carriage, indicating a possible transmission of Sii from animals to humans. The population structure of Sii in Côte d’Ivoire revealed a close relationship across human and dairy isolates in East and West Africa with a predicted founder linking back to a Kenyan human isolate. The presence of dairy adaptations and isolation origins however suggest the establishment of multiple dairy lineages and an evolution driven by recombination rather than clonal development. In-depth investigations on the ecology, potential reservoirs and pathways of contamination by Sii at the human-animal-environment interface in Africa will be needed in comparison to yet to be collected data from Europe, Asia and the Americas to further elucidate the various roles of Sii.']"
2016-05-17T00:00:00Z,Forest Management Intensity Affects Aquatic Communities in Artificial Tree Holes,"['Our results indicate that forest management has substantial and pervasive effects on communities which may alter their structure and functioning through a number of different mechanisms. Whereas more direct impacts of management on other types of communities in forests had been reported before [1, 3–5], the effect on aquatic communities constitutes novel information (but see Gossner et al. [10] for natural tree holes). We did not find strong individual direct pathways that may explain the effect of forest management intensity on communities via the measured environmental variables. Instead, multiple indirect effects seem to be central here. These could for example operate via effects of management on the species richness of trees and other plants, changing light and temperature conditions, resource input into tree holes and the structure of the matrix between communities that may influence dispersal processes and conditions for adult insects (e.g. nutrition and shelter). By investigating community change in tree holes we may be integrating over a number of direct and indirect effects to derive a more comprehensive picture of the consequences of change in forest management intensity on communities. We furthermore conclude that artificial tree-hole analogues constitute a useful experimental alternative to test effects of land-use change on natural communities and may indeed be used as an early-warning or indicator system of ecosystem modifications in conservation assessments.']"

Interestingly, for histone H3 two different isoforms were separated on the immunoblots, which could correspond to H3.1 and H3.2 isoforms previously found in terrestrial animals.Concerning gene expression, butyrate applied as a nutritional supplement caused significant changes in vivo in the expression of genes related to epigenetic regulatory mechanisms such as hdac11, ehmt2, and dicer1. Statistical analysis by two-way ANOVA for these genes showed significant differences due to the butyrate treatment (P = 0.002) and to the interaction between tissue and treatment (P = 0.010). The expression of four (il1 β, il8, irf1, and tnfα) out of seven target genes related to mucosal protection and inflammatory response was significantly different between the two analyzed tissues but only for the il10 gene were differences observed in the expression (P = 0.003) due to the butyrate treatment. Thus, in this study we reveal some of the effects of butyrate supplementation. This information is essential for the development of substitution diets in the efforts to improve the sustainability of the aquaculture of carnivorous species.']"
2018-05-02T00:00:00Z,Diversity and population structure of red rice germplasm in Bangladesh,"['In general, care should be taken when selecting germplasm for any breeding program attempting yield enhancement. Cluster analysis from the agro-morphological features grouped all the germplasm into five groups. Significant (at both p ≤ 0.05 and p ≤ 0.01) differences were found in all fifteen agro-morphological traits, which confirms the presence of diversification among the fifty red rice germplasm. From molecular analysis using SSR markers, three groups were found, while population structure analysis showed all tested germplasm constructed as four populations, each significantly differentiated and with their variation confirmed by AMOVA.From the findings of the population structure analysis, in particular, large genetic differences were also observed between two populations (group A and D), suggesting that these could be crossed to improve grain yield. As such, the germplasm, as well as the highly polymorphic SSR markers identified in this study, have the potential to facilitate a red rice breeding program for enhanced yield. Based on these findings, we are currently developing such a program to facilitate more desirable, novel trait-linked markers usable for not only the mapping of QTLs/genes against a diversity of abiotic and biotic stresses but also the breeding of socially and economically desirable traits in red rice. The findings of this study provide a solid foundation for such further work in the effort to increase the yields of this increasingly popular and both medically and nutritively beneficial red rice.']"
2016-11-15T00:00:00Z,Food Insecurity and Common Mental Disorders among Ethiopian Youth: Structural Equation Modeling,"['In this study, food insecurity was associated with common mental disorders among youth in Ethiopia. The pathway was mainly direct, suggesting that lack of access to reliable and sufficient amounts of food not only affected youths’ physical health and nutritional status but also their mental health. The implications of these findings are far-reaching. First, exploring such evidence might indicates the social inequalities at earliest age and or the long-term trajectories of food insecurity that could persist into poor health status in adulthood. Second, this evidence could direct program planners, policy makers to design proper interventions for prevention of both mental health and food insecurity status. It gives insights on the importance of considering strategies to improve access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to curtail the detrimental effect of food insecurity on physical and mental health of youth. Further analysis will aim to verify these results with additional sources of data to see the longitudinal effect of exposures to food insecurity on mental health, and examine other plausible models to better understand the mechanism by which food insecurity is linked to poor mental health. Additional investigation is also recommended to verify the mediation role of time varying measures, whether changes in the mediator are more likely to precede the change in mental health status, and to what extent temporal order of change over time leads to plausible conclusions about the mediation and their relationship.']"

Effective coverage achieved by Delivery Model 2 was low despite increases in message and contact coverages.Findings from the present work suggest that future programming efforts should use the health extension / microfinance / petty trader approach (Delivery Model 1) in rural settings and consider adapting this approach for use in urban and peri-urban settings. Ongoing BCC and demand creation activities will be essential to the continued success of any such programming.The work reported here indicates that product availability and brand recognition, while necessary, are not sufficient to deliver effective coverage and impact. The use of social marketing is not a simple alternative for achieving high coverage and impact for health and nutrition interventions. This is likely to be particularly true if the product is one for which there is no pre-existing supply chain, no pre-existing demand (home fortification is a new feeding behavior), and a consumer-base subject to a high and constant churn rate (children enter and leave the consumer-base as they age), and which may offer a low potential for profit. Such products will need skillful and sustained BCC and demand creation work in potential consumers and throughout the supply chain if coverage and impact are to be achieved. Successful use of markets requires hard and exacting work for which there is no magical labor-saving mechanism that can be easily harnessed to deliver public goods.']"
2016-02-11T00:00:00Z,Elevated Blood Lead Levels Are Associated with Reduced Risk of Malaria in Beninese Infants,"['In conclusion, our study shows that BLL are negatively associated with malarial risk considering other risk factors. Malaria entails high morbidity and mortality rates among infants under 5 years worldwide[10], and lead poisoning is the 6th most important contributor to the global burden of diseases measured in disability adjusted life years (DALYs) according to the Institute of Health Metrics, with Sub-Saharan African countries being predominantly responsible for the global DALYs[30]. Our study shows very high rates of EBLL in young infants (12 months). This should raise the awareness of public health authorities to further evaluate the sources and the epidemiological consequences for infants. Lead poisoning entails severe consequences for the development of the children and is associated with major health problems highly prevalent in West Africa, such as anemia and under-nutrition, having an important impact on the infants and their communities. In addition, our study is the first to show a negative association between lead levels and malaria risk in multivariable analyses. Therefore, these results should be confirmed in the context of a prospective cohort. Furthermore, the social and financial consequences of EBLL and lead poisoning appeal to further explore the epidemiological evidence of the association of EBLL with communicable diseases in developing countries. Finally, public health interventions should look forward to minimize the exposure to lead. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the lead sources to better protect the population in West Africa.']"

We have thoroughly mapped the proteins in both their Native organization and under denaturing conditions, respectively using BN-PAGE and standard 2DE. Furthermore and as this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first application of the BN-PAGE technique to mammary gland mitochondria, we have also contributed to the establishment of adequate and reproducible laboratorial methodology of use in this type of tissue. We have finally studied the protein expression changes in the mammary gland of two goat breeds with different levels of tolerance to SWL, highlighting several proteins that showed differential expression between breeds and nutritional treatments and as such, and upon adequate validation, could be proposed as putative biomarkers of tolerance to SWL and maintenance of lactation and mammary gland function in these animals. Results indicate that SWL tolerance and milk production under SWL are related to proteins involved in the apoptotic and cell senescence processes, with higher expression results in the Palmera breed, whereas the Majorera breed maintains the expression of these proteins at constant level. The control of apoptosis seems therefore to be the key link to understand SWL tolerance and its links to the production performances of these animals. These results furthermore serve as a basis for studies in other domestic dairy ruminants, particularly sheep and cattle. Understanding the molecular basis of tolerance to SWL is a complex task. It would therefore be interesting to conduct further research at the transcriptomics, proteomics (extra mitochondrial), lipidomics and metabolomics levels.']"
2016-05-03T00:00:00Z,Whole Blood Levels of the n-6 Essential Fatty Acid Linoleic Acid Are Inversely Associated with Stunting in 2-to-6 Year Old Tanzanian Children: A Cross-Sectional Study,"['This study assessed whole blood levels of EFAs and the association between whole blood FA levels and growth parameters in children 2–6 years of age. EFA levels in 2-to-6 year old Tanzanian children were low as demonstrated by high levels of Mead acid and large T/T ratios, both markers of EFAD. In this population, levels of certain FAs in blood were associated with growth parameters. Most notably, higher n-6 FA levels were associated with greater linear growth whereas higher n-9 FA levels were associated with impaired linear growth. The inadequate levels of FAs in this population may not only be associated with impaired growth, but may also be associated with impaired immunity or poor cognitive development. Thus, future studies of nutritional interventions for Tanzanian children should consider providing FAs in addition to sufficient calories, protein and micronutrients. Additionally, these studies should encourage the incorporation of locally available FA-rich seeds and oils into meals and snacks for infants and children. Finally, the development of simple instrumentation that can be used in the field to analyze FAs and FA metabolites in whole blood would be useful for future studies. In sum, this study sets the foundation for future studies assessing the relationship between whole blood FA composition and growth in children residing in other areas of Tanzania, ideally over their entire life course.']"
2015-04-15T00:00:00Z,"Seasonal Patterns of Hormones, Macroparasites, and Microparasites in Wild African Ungulates: The Interplay among Stress, Reproduction, and Disease","['In summary, we found evidence that stress, reproduction, immunity, and pathogens exhibit strong seasonality in ENP. Most zebra and springbok in ENP are indeed seasonal breeders, with both species experiencing parturition and lactation primarily in the wet season, zebra experiencing most estrus and breeding behaviors in the wet season, and both species experiencing mid-gestation in the hot dry season. Overall immune allocation is highest during the wet season, likely driven, at least in part, by nutritional factors [17]. Stress hormone levels are highest overall in the dry season, though these seasonal signals are stronger in zebras. While peaks in reproductive hormone levels are correlated with immunosuppression, increased parasite infection intensity, and decreased anti-anthrax antibody titers, stress hormone levels are largely unaffected by macroparasite prevalence or infection intensity. Instead, stress hormone levels are most strongly correlated with environmental and reproductive factors, particularly with the demands of mid-gestation. This likely indicates that these hosts are evolutionarily tolerant of their GI parasites, despite the fact that they are not neutral actors in these hosts; parasites do affect body condition and use host resources, hosts do allocate immune resources toward keeping parasite infections in check, and parasites likely cause host immunomodulation and may even increase susceptibility to B. anthracis in this system. However, parasite tolerance strategies indeed make sense in a system in which macroparasites are nearly ubiquitous but almost never lethal, while pathogens such as B. anthracis are often lethal but considerably more rare.']"
2019-02-27T00:00:00Z,A case-control study of trace-element status and lung cancer in Appalachian Kentucky,"['Our case-control study provides meaningful participant-level assessment of a randomly selected controls from an area of highest incidence of lung cancer in the United States compared to cancer patients from the same region. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, based on previous studies, we found that there was no positive association between trace-element concentrations, in toenails and lung cancer in our study population. We found a negative association between toenail concentrations and lung cancers for several elements in univariate models (Al, Mn, Cr, and Se) with only Mn being significant in multivariate analysis. Overall, toenail trace element concentrations were similar to or lower than those of controls from a variety of previously studied populations, perhaps accounting for the observed lack of positive correlation with lung cancer incidence. For some elements, such as for Se, Cr and Mn, negative associations with lung cancer may point to nutritional differences in the population that could be associated with cancers or other chronic health conditions; however, a lack of significance in our multivariate models indicates that confounding factors likely explain these associations. While some significant differences in drinking water concentrations were found between cases and controls, the concentrations of trace elements in drinking water were low and were not reflected in toenail concentrations. Additionally, we found that fingernails are not a reliable surrogate for assessing mid-term trace element exposure.']"

Three bathymodiolin species were present at the three seeps, with Bathymodiolus childressi being by far the most abundant. The presence of single individuals of other species (B. mauritanicus at BCS and B. heckerae at NCS) raises interesting questions regarding dispersal and drivers of distribution within the bathymodiolins. This study coupled with results from [13] provide indirect but compelling evidence that B. childressi utilizes sulfur for metabolism through thiotrophic Campylobacterota epibionts, though there is a contrasting pattern between abundance of the Campylobacterota and isotope signatures between sites. These results draw a complex picture of associations between mussels and symbiotic bacteria in the Northeast Atlantic, which may vary depending on local characteristics of the habitats and microbial interactions. Perhaps the mussels’ ability to take advantage of thiotrophic bacteria is transient, considering the observed variation in the periostracum δ13C as well as small changes in the δ34S [13], which is the best analog for changes over the mussels’ lifespan. Whether the variability observed in the thiotrophy signal between gill samples at this site is due to micro-spatial differential chemical signatures between sampled mussels, or temporal variability of the chemical signatures, remains to be seen. Future studies that couple environmental measurements of chemical species, samples of ambient water, and gill microbiomes in tandem will further elucidate the role that the Campylobacterota epibionts play in host nutrition as well as in oceanic carbon and sulfur cycling.']"

Alterations in blood vessel formation during placental development has the potential to reduce blood flow, leading to reduced nutrient delivery and an environment of fetal undernutrition. Fetal nutrition, or the supply of metabolic substrates delivered for growth and development, contributes to immediate, intermediate, and long-term health [142]. Immediate health consequences include intrauterine growth restriction and low birthweight. Childhood obesity, hypertension, and diabetes are the most common intermediate and long-term health consequences of fetal undernutrition [143]. Some authors postulate that early fetal and infant environment is strongly predictive for the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases later in life [143–147].The main pathways by which preeclampsia or pregnancy-related complications serve to modify vascular risk would appear to be hypoxia, antiangiogenesis, endothelial dysfunction and immune modifications. These pathways individually, synergistically, or cumulatively appear to alter the epigenetic potential of placenta itself including microRNA expression profile. And so the exposition to a preeclampsia or pregnancy-related complication environment in utero leads to altered phenotype after birth [147].']"

Dietary linseed or linseed and algae decreased the expression of ACACA and SCD in both SC and IM AT and FADS1, FADS2 and ELOVL5 in the IM AT, suggesting a regulation in the novo FA synthesis and a shift in monounsturared FA formation.With reference to adipose tissue development, differences in cellularity as well as in expression of genes related to differentiation and lipogenesis and LCPUFA synthesis, indicate that SC and IM adipose tissues may possess distinct regulation, which results in different fat accretion and varied fatty acid distribution. Supplementing diets with linseed or linseed in combination with algae led to an enrichment of C18:3 n-3 and reduced n-6/n-3 ratio in both SC and IM adipose tissues. Algae addition seemed to be more effective than linseed addition in increasing the physiologically important EPA and DHA content in the studied tissues, but it had adverse effects on meat quality, as the meat from lambs fed linseed with algae presented greater lipid oxidation and reduced ratings for odor, flavor and overall acceptability. The content of ALA, LA and LCPUFA in the diet of lambs is an important factor in the nutritional regulation of lipid metabolism, especially in the LCPUFA synthesis, and further work is needed to elucidate the molecular and biochemical mechanisms controlling the synthesis and deposition of these fatty acids.']"

Results suggest nutrition, work activities and tourist numbers may affect metabolic, lipid panel and FGM concentrations. We conclude that elephant well-being can be promoted by limiting the amount of high calorie treats given by tourists, ensuring animals receive appropriate amounts of exercise to reduce fat and increase muscle mass, and reducing stress by moderating the numbers of tourists interacting with individual elephants, especially during the High season.Comparing FGM measures to elephants in U.S. zoos (mean, 124.69 ± 4.26 ng/g; range, 59.69–282.88 ng/g; n = 106) [Brown, Ange, Carlstead, unpublished], concentrations in Thailand were within the range, but mean concentrations were lower. The same EIA was employed, but the extraction technique differed, which might explain some of the differences. More work is needed to develop reference ranges for FGM, metabolic marker and lipid measures to determine what is ‘normal’ versus ‘abnormal’, although again, use of different laboratories and techniques can make interpretation challenging. This study also was only conducted for 1 year, so follow up observations are needed to determine if the patterns hold across years, and how changes in management influence subsequent results.']"

This study indicated that colored flesh potato tubers contain a mixture of several phenolic compounds ranging from phenolic acid to anthocyanins. We have separated, isolated and characterized the group of phenolic acid and anthocyanin compounds in colored flesh potatoes. It is interesting to note that these group of compounds had significant inhibitory activities on α-glucosidase, α-amylase, and aldose reductase. These phenolic compounds acted effective non-competitive inhibitors and mixed with carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes such as α-amylase and α-glucosidase. Thus polyphenol rich potato tubers have the potential to interfere with or delay absorption of dietary carbohydrates in the small intestine, leading to suppression of postprandial blood glucose sugars. However, there are reports of a problem on the direct intestinal absorption of anthocyanins and phenolic compounds. It was mentioned that about 1% or less of ingested anthocyanin is estimated to be incorporated into plasma. There is a possibility of biotransformation of these phenolic compounds after consumption. Food-grade phenolic inhibitors from potatoes are potentially safer, and therefore may be preferred alternatives for inhibition of carbohydrate breakdown and control of glycemic index. Additionally, the significant inhibitory effect on aldose reductase suggests that phenolic fractions in potato tubers can possess constituents with antidiabetic and inhibitory effects on diabetic complications.']"

In addition to pathogens, other factors including seasonal variation in colony size, foraging requirements, nutrition, and pesticide exposure all impact colony health [10,35,38,69,70]. Therefore, temporal monitoring projects that emphasize robust sampling designs (e.g., consistent monthly samples obtained on a specific date) and include large sample sizes and multiple monitored factors, are required to fully describe both general and acute threats to honey bee colonies throughout the year and in the context of pollination of specific crops. Additionally, the synergistic effects of co-infecting honey bee pathogens [35,64], which can impact the prevalence and abundance of other pathogens [7,28,31,49], must be investigated from a multidimensional approach to study the effects of pathogens on honey bee colony health. The combination of sampling individual honey bee colonies on specific days of the year and across multiple sites, and employment of statistical methods aimed at integrating and interpreting multifactorial data sets, will further our understanding of the factors with the greatest influence on colony losses and may result in the development of strategies to limit future losses.']"

Evidence from the U.K. suggests that multifaceted interventions combined with research can lead to substantial reductions in a short time. This survey, the first known nationally-representative consumer survey focused on wasted food in the U.S., provides essential data to assist those developing interventions using education, changes in business practices, and policy, as well as baseline data against which to measure effectiveness. It suggests approaches including avoiding treating consumers as if they are completely new to the issue of wasted food, framing messages focused on budgets, and providing smaller portions. In addition, there is a need to sharpen our messages about food safety and freshness in order to expand acceptability of those foods that may be less attractive or nearing their expiration dates but are unlikely to be hazardous, while avoiding waste prevention messaging that could increase food safety hazards. The survey also suggests opportunities to shift business practices to support consumer-desired changes that prevent waste. It highlights critical research gaps, particularly in better understanding the actual behaviors underlying the survey responses provided. Finally, it provides reason for optimism about waste prevention in the U.S.—because respondents are concerned about wasted food, and are interested in taking further action.']"
2015-05-26T00:00:00Z,Flavonoid Intake in European Adults (18 to 64 Years),"['Our results provide a detailed overview of flavonoid consumption in European adults. These results allow for a comparison of habitual intake in the general public with the amounts used in dietary intervention studies. Our data suggest that habitual intake of most compounds is likely too low to result in a reduced risk of cardio-vascular diseases, but also too low to result in adverse effects. However, a lack of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of intervention studies makes these comparisons difficult. Further research is required to investigate the potential health benefits of flavonoids, in particular the primary prevention of chronic diseases in the general public. It is in particular important to use standardised and validated analytical methods and a consistent nomenclature of compounds to ensure that results are comparable. Furthermore, the development of improved dietary assessment methods, especially using nutritional biomarkers, is important to investigate the potential health effects of flavonoids in larger observational studies.An important result of our study was the skewed distribution of flavonoid intake, especially in Belgium and Germany. In both countries, half of the adult population consumed only negligible amounts of monomeric and polymeric flavonoids. Most observational studies conducted so far have found the highest risk of cardio-vascular diseases with very low flavonoid intake [12–14], and even though it is not clear whether this is due to dietary or other factors, it is important to investigate whether these dietary patterns have an impact on public health.']"
2016-11-04T00:00:00Z,Constitutive and Operational Variation of Learning in Foraging Predatory Mites,"['Our study provides evidence that thrips experience by A. swirskii females early in life alters their behavior towards this prey as adults, and is one of a few studies rigorously comparing the effects of associative and non-associative learning in one and the same learning task. Rearing diet had a decisive influence on learning performance, but our experimental design was not apt to elucidate the mechanisms of the compromised learning ability of predatory mites reared on pollen. We argue that the observed behavioral changes indicate a reduced learning ability as a consequence of either nutritional deficiency, nutrient allocation shift or laboratory selection, but further research is needed to shed light on these matters. The finding that population origin, long-term mass rearing on a factitious prey, did not compromise learning, as compared to the population collected in the field, is relevant for the use of A. swirskii in biological control. The presence of a specific prey or their cues during rearing may increase the efficacy of the biological control agents, if these are then better able to recognize, handle and attack this prey in the crop. Amblyseius swirskii is widely used in biological control of thrips [43,44,51], but is commonly mass-reared on astigmatic mites and thus does never experience thrips before release in the greenhouse crop [52,53]. As previously suggested [28,40], evaluating ways to prime or condition biological control agents before their release in the field, and thus, enhance their efficacy against a specific pest, represents exciting future research topics.']"

In this global health context, this study fills an important gap in the public health literature [11] on the impact of delivering a critically important child survival, nutrition, and human development intervention at scale. Using rigorous cluster-randomized evaluation designs, it shows that comprehensive behavior change strategies implemented at scale, under real-life conditions, and delivered through outreach-based (Bangladesh) and facility-based (Viet Nam) platforms have strong and significant impacts on breastfeeding practices. Strategies that combine intensive IPC with MM campaigns, CM, and advocacy are more effective than standard counseling with less-intensive accompanying strategies. Our study demonstrates the impacts of recommended complex adaptive systems-based approaches to programming for scaling up combined interventions to improve breastfeeding in low- and middle-income countries [10]. We conclude that investments in combined, coordinated, and data-driven strategies, especially those that intensify counseling and are supported by MM, CM, and PA, are recommended for replication in similar contexts and for sustained implementation in Bangladesh and Viet Nam.']"
2016-10-24T00:00:00Z,"The MADS Box Genes ABS, SHP1, and SHP2 Are Essential for the Coordination of Cell Divisions in Ovule and Seed Coat Development and for Endosperm Formation in Arabidopsis thaliana","['Our work suggests that ABS is not only required for the regulation of PA accumulation in the seed coat but that its functions are of much broader impact: they range from positively regulating coordinated cell divisions in the inner integument layer of the ovule, nuclear endosperm proliferation and thus seed cavity expansion, to regulating endothelium cell morphology, and to its influence on mucilage release of the seed coat epidermal cell layer. Novel roles could also be identified for SHP1 and SHP2: these genes are required for synchronized ovule maturation and subsequent fertilization/seed maturation, seed mucilage production, and have an inhibitory effect which is antagonistic to the ABS function in controlling formative divisions and cell shape of the inner integument and seed coat layers. Unlike SHP1 and SHP2, which are the result of a rather recent genome duplication and specific to the Brassicaceae [64], orthologs of ABS were present in the most recent common ancestor of gymnosperms and angiosperms [25]. The newly discovered function of ABS in endosperm development and its coordination with inner seed coat formation provide a hint towards original function of Bsister genes, which may be conserved throughout the seed plants. The ability to protect the zygote by integuments from the environment and to produce a nutritive tissue embedding and supporting the embryo and providing nutrients to the seedling after germination is one of the key traits to seed plant success to which the Bsister genes have contributed significantly.']"
2018-11-14T00:00:00Z,The gill-associated microbiome is the main source of wood plant polysaccharide hydrolases and secondary metabolite gene clusters in the mangrove shipworm Neoteredo reynei,"['In this study we applied metagenomics to characterize the microbial communities of the digestive gland, intestine and gill of the mangrove specialist shipworm Neoteredo reynei. We provided strong evidences that the N. reynei gill symbiont gammaproteobacterial community is a hot spot for biotechnologically relevant enzymes, such as CAZymes involved on breaking down wood-derived complex polysaccharides, and biosynthetic gene clusters for production of potentially bioactive secondary metabolites such as complex polyketides, peptides and lipopeptides. Further, the discrete bacterial communities forming the microbiome of the digestive tract tissues seems to have little or no involvement in host nutritional support or chemical defense. Digestive gland and intestine datasets presented a simple repertoire of CAZymes, lacking GHs for digestion of woody material, and only one fragmented BGC with hits to a locus of the Yesso scallop bivalve mollusk genome. Two representative symbiotic genomes were recovered from gill symbiotic community and taxonomically assigned as a T. turnerae strain and a yet to be cultivated Teredinibacter sp. bacterium. The latter encoded novel multi-catalytic CAZymes, and a trans-AT PKS BGC containing the catalytic domains implicated in β-branching in related polyketides. Finally, we demonstrate that the Teredinibacter genus is highly enriched in secondary metabolite pathways in comparison to relatives of the Cellvibrionaceae family, including a plethora of BGCs for complex polyketides and nonribosomal peptides, reinforcing the possible role of these compounds on supporting the symbiosis.']"

Firstly is maternal education. Maternal education was found to have a protective effect on risk of anaemia. The government should focus on providing information to young mothers on adequate nutrition for their young babies. Information on food products including indigenous African foods, which contain relevant vitamins and iron, will go a long way in reducing anaemia prevalence in the country [11]–[13], [28], [29].Secondly, up scaling interventions on malaria and ensuring that these interventions cover most parts of the country will lead to reduction in anaemia cases. This is a consequence of the finding that there is strong association between malaria and anaemia in the children.Hither to, the study highlights two main areas which could provide avenues for reducing the prevalence of anaemia in Kenya. These areas are, controlling co-morbidity of malaria and anaemia, and improving maternal knowledge.No study goes without limitations. One major limitation of this study is the cross-sectional nature of the study. Follow-up studies provide more insight into public health problems. Another limitation was due to the fact that anaemia was measured based on hemoglobin concentration only, inclusion of other measures such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and plasma ferriton (PF) concentration [30] could lead to better diagnosis results. Despite these limitations, this present study has determined the prevalence and risk factors of anaemia among children.']"

While the patterns and processes observed in the open pools seems to be mostly driven by physical factors and the tolerance of organisms to such conditions, in closed pools there seems to be a synergy between physical factors and biotic interactions (e.g. reef fish feeding pressure and herbivory). The functioning and structure of closed pools are probably a combination of: (1) algal turfs that comprised around 50% of benthic cover and were mostly composed by small cropped pieces of the alga Digenea simplex, that has a high nutritional value and was highly consumed in herbivory assays; (2) high abundance of Acanthurus chirurgus using these pools as refuges to wave exposure and predation; (3) high feeding pressure of A. chirurgus affecting the benthic composition of this habitat by cropping D. simplex and limiting its growth and distribution. Thus, the direct effect of wave exposure interacts with the indirect effect of predators on fish feeding behavior and play an important role in the structure and functioning of these habitats. The relative contribution of direct vs. indirect mechanisms shaping biological communities and how they scale-up to ecosystem functioning deserve further attention, particularly on isolated near-pristine systems where natural processes can still be studied under limited human impact.']"

Elevated temperature influenced solubility, bioavailability of some compounds and gas transport. However, elevated water temperature did not protect the heart from functional oil-induced modifications, such as bradycardia. Stroke volume was unaffected, and cardiac output only slightly affected, by elevated temperature. Furthermore, reduction of edema in the pericardium and yolk sinus cavity occurred at 30°C. Nevertheless, a potential protective role of warmer temperature cannot be supported, because of a lethal effect observed at higher exposure concentrations. Quite the contrary, this smaller area of edema is probably morphologically related to the advanced development in time of larvae, in which yolk sac absorption becomes more important and nutritional and energetic reserves decrease, leading to increasing vulnerability of larval fish. We suggest that elevated temperature may decrease larval resilience to oil exposure by amplifying energetic costs to organisms. However, it is difficult to demonstrate this effect of increased energetic costs with short term exposure. This study adds growing evidence to the importance of considering environmental factors in risk assessment of anthropogenic pollutants on physiology and fitness of aquatic organisms. In the current context of global warming, environmental water temperature should be considered as a key variable and thermally related physiological challenges should be used in toxicity testing to further explore physiological and ecological impacts of these interactions.']"

Additionally, mothers of boys and of were more likely to want CLS, whereas mothers of girls and of overweight and obese children were more likely to want CTS. A positive correlation was observed between maternal body dissatisfaction and dissatisfaction with child's body size. This study suggests that mothers tend to transpose their body dissatisfaction to their child's body, as well as their desire to lose or gain weight. Thus, the study findings can help guide health professionals and policy makers to develop and improve interventions and public policies that seek to prevent weight problems in children.Within this context, the discussion about current health and beauty standards and their impact on the perception of child's nutritional status gains relevance. Furthermore, maternal involvement in strategies to prevent and treat childhood overweight is relevant, and maternal concerns and dissatisfactions with her body and with her child's body should be considered. Therefore, it is necessary that health professionals make an integral approach because the mother’s dissatisfaction with child’s body size can have a potential impact on maternal attitudes and practices related to children's food intake and on the relationship of children with their own body size as they mature. Moreover, longitudinal studies should be conducted to evaluate the influence of maternal dissatisfaction with child's body size on maternal practices and attitudes related to their child’s body, food consumption and lifestyle.""]"

We have mined the genome of C. acnes and identified a set of genes that are likely candidates for degradation of host N-glycans. We have also presented the biochemical and structural characterization of one enzyme in the proposed pathway, namely the exo-β-1,4-mannosidase that is able to catalyze hydrolysis of the β-1,4-glycosidic bond between the second GlcNAc and the first mannose residue in the canonical eukaryotic N-glycan core. This is the first reported enzymatic activity of subfamily GH5_18, and the first characterized GH5 enzyme likely to be involved in N-glycan degradation. Our results provide a valuable platform for further efforts to elucidate the complete set of activities of the proposed C. acnes N-glycan degradation pathway.Based on our structural and functional characterization of CaMan5_18, and whole-genome analysis, we propose a pathway for complete N-glycan degradation and utilization by C. acnes strain 266, results that offer new insights into the host-microbe interaction of this bacterium. We propose that this pathway allows the C. acnes to use host N-glycans as a means of nutrition, and possibly, also to contribute to virulence in susceptible individuals. The ability to degrade N-glycans would complement the demonstrated ability of C. acnes to disassemble O-glycans, which makes this bacterium well adapted to utilize a wide range of host glycans.']"
2017-04-11T00:00:00Z,Global trends in dietary micronutrient supplies and estimated prevalence of inadequate intakes,"['We estimated global micronutrient supplies at the national level of eight vitamins and six minerals, their bioavailability, and prevalence of inadequate intake, including an estimated Prevalence of Inadequate Micronutrient Intake Index (PIMII) and a Micronutrient Density Index (MDI). We found that the MDI has improved over the past 50 years in most regions, but it has declined in sub-Saharan Africa. The PIMII has declined in all regions during this period—although in sub-Saharan Africa it only started to decrease in 1990—due to increased total energy supplies and/or dietary micronutrient density. Increasing the availability of food energy supplies is still necessary for countries whose energy supplies fall short of their population’s requirements, and this may reduce both hunger and micronutrient deficiencies, although efforts to increase dietary micronutrient density should also be considered.Countries with adequate energy supplies but a high estimated prevalence of inadequate micronutrient intakes may benefit from a greater focus on increasing the nutrient density of the food supply through diversification, fortification, and biofortification; improving access to and utilization of nutrient-dense foods; and nutrition education. General approaches to reduce poverty and increase education, especially of women, are integral to sustainably addressing malnutrition in low- and middle-income countries. Our indices may be used on their own, or in conjunction with the Global Hunger Index [62] or specific anthropometric indicators such as stunting and wasting or overweight and obesity to understand spatial and temporal trends in malnutrition, dietary quality, and related health effects.']"

When compared to continuous growth bulls, meat from the discontinuous group had greater levels of 18:1 isomers and lower levels of branched chain fatty acids, which could reveal an important impact of discontinuous growth on rumen microbial metabolism. Increased expression of genes associated with fatty acid beta-oxidation where shown during feed restrictionwhereasduring re-feeding predominate the expression of genes associated with fatty acid synthesis. This pattern can be observed in Alentejana bulls, after 9 months of compensatory growth,. When compared to continuous growth bulls some genes such as ELOVL5 and FASN, which have a key role in fatty acid syntheses and elongation, were up-regulated in discontinuous growth bulls. It was observed a clear trend on delta-9 desaturase activity indices, which were consistently higher in discontinuous bulls, suggesting an important effect of growth path on SCD1 and SCD5 mRNA levels. However, this was not associated to differences in the expression of both genes. As for others, it is possible that these genes may have an important role in fatty acid metabolism during refeeding but are no longer up-regulated at slaughter. These results contribute to the knowledge about the mechanisms involved in fatty acid metabolism during compensatory growth at a molecular level and could help to identify genomic biomarkers that can be used in the future in the selection of cattle used in traditional beef production systems in Mediterranean areas.']"

To address the factors associated with poor treatment outcomes revealed in our study, a systematic multi-pronged approach would be needed. Accordingly, since the time this analysis was conducted, RNTCP policies and interventions are built to address these factors and are being scaled-up in India. These are designed to detect DR-TB early with universal rapid molecular DST before multiple prolonged treatment exposures or before cavitary disease sets in; to treat all variants of DR-TB promptly with regimen designs guided by baseline SL-LPA triage for FQ and/or SLI resistance including shorter MDR-TB regimen (if susceptible to FQ and SLI) or longer DST guided regimen with newer drugs like Bedaquiline; to build systems for real-time DR-TB surveillance, decentralized counseling to promote adherence, nutritional assessment and supplementation to avert weight loss and influence of undernutrition and to prevent further emergence of DR-TB with transition to daily FDC regimen for DS-TB.

ICAR areas have been identified as the endometrial regions more affected by perturbations in maternal metabolism in post-partum cows. We identified FOXL2 and oxidative stress-related enzymes as genes whose expression was modified by the absence of lactation. Based on our gene expression data in endometrial ICAR areas of these pregnant females, lactating cows were not significantly different from heifers whereas previously published analyses of circulating metabolites (insulin, IGF1, glucose, NEFA) in these same females indicated that lactating cows were distinct from heifers and dry cows during postpartum in the absence of pregnancy [39]. Pregnancy may have brought about modifications in expressed factors and biological functions in the endometrium of lactating cows that were not detected with our candidate gene approach. Certainly more genes and other biological functions in the endometrium are affected, and their identification prompts the need for more comprehensive molecular analyses of this tissue. Considering the driving property of the endometrium on the trajectory of embryo development [13], it appears critical to determine if molecular modifications detected at the endometrial level have an impact on conceptus features that have been shown to react to subtle modifications in dam energy metabolism [5]. These investigations may provide new approaches for nutritional strategies that could alleviate the negative impact of lactation on prenatal programming of adult performances when lactation and pregnancy overlap.']"

For overweight, the associated sociodemographic factors were: being a woman, high socioeconomic status, residing in an urban area, being an Indian, watching television and / or video games for three days in the last week and watching two or more hours of television and / or video games in one day. On the other hand, obesity is associated with sociodemographic factors such as: being a woman, medium socioeconomic level, medium-high and high, being Afro-Colombian, watching television and / or playing video games in the last seven days and watching television and / or video games for seven days during the last week. By adjusting the models by age and by all variables, overweight and obesity showed the same significant associations although with different values, being a woman, socioeconomic level III, IV or more and residing in an urban area.In searches of information made by the authors, it was observed that the present study shows the most current findings of overweight-obesity association with the time spent watching television and sociodemographic determinants in a representative sample of adolescents from Colombia. Overweight and obesity in adolescents could be addressed through the control of sociocultural behaviors, such as: the good use of new technologies; establish limits to watch television between 1 and 1.5 hours per day, especially on holidays; perform and / or increase the level of physical activity; decrease the consumption of products with high caloric content and low nutritional value, essentially, while watching television.']"

(1) Optimal dietary SIF supplementation (the 25 or 50 mg SIF/kg diet) increased muscle protein total PUFA, healthcare fatty acid (ALA, EPA and DHA), total FAA, Glu, Asp, 5'-IMP content, WHC and tenderness, promoting the nutritive value, health benefits, flavour quality indicators in the muscle of fish; (2) Optimal dietary SIF supplementation (the 25 or 50 mg SIF/kg diet) increased WHC and tenderness, enhancing the meat quality. Further exploration showed that the SIF-elevated WHC might be associated with a high collagen concentration and low cathepsin B and L activities as well as reduced apoptosis in fish muscle, whereas SIF-increased tenderness may be associated with an elevated WHC and an enhanced antioxidant capacity in fish muscle. On the other hand, SIF-increased antioxidant capacity was ascribed to an increase in the GSH content and antioxidant enzyme (except CuZnSOD) activities regulated by their gene expression and Nrf2 signalling in fish muscle. (3) Excessive SIF (100 or 125 mg/kg) could inhibit some of these positive effects, when compared with the optimal level of SIF.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0209570.g005\nFig 5\n\nGeneral summary for the effects of dietary SIF on meat quality and its potential signaling pathways in the muscle of fish.\nWHC, water-holding capacity; Nrf2, NF-E2-related factor 2; 5'-IMP, 5'-inosine monophosphate; FAA, free amino acids; TOR, target of rapamycin.\n\n\n""]"
2015-04-01T00:00:00Z,In Vitro Growth of Curcuma longa L. in Response to Five Mineral Elements and Plant Density in Fed-Batch Culture Systems,"['Plant growth and development in large vessels (2.5 l) over a long period in treatment conditions (5-months) allowed significant expression of the effects of the treatment factors on turmeric growth. The models presented here have better predictive value (R2p) than the models prior work in small vessels (180 ml) batch cultures over 35-days with similar treatment factor combinations [20]. The sparsely sampled design space was allowed accurate modeling of complex relationships in fed-batch bioreactors. Prior work with SF bioreactors shows sucrose conversion to rhizome mass in turmeric can be scaled from batch to fed-batch over longer periods of time [14]. Similarly, NSF technique, 2.5 l vessels, and experimental designs used in this work could predict mineral use and optimal nutrition for larger-scale bioreactors.Potassium nitrate and P induce fresh and dry plant biomass when water and sucrose are supplied in adequate amounts through a fed batch process. NSF technique is recommend when 1) propagating at low plant density which is appropriate for increasing the number of elite plants in vitro, and 2) using high plant density required more nutrients to produce more biomass. However, rhizomes have a different optimal medium than multiplication ratio and fresh biomass production with the incipient nutrients stress of SF necessary to maximize rhizome dry biomass. Optimal concentrations of the mineral nutrients in a media formulation changes with the desired response and the process used.']"

Even in absence of such a challenge, without proper nutrition, pups are likely to be unable to elicit responses against opportunistic pathogens, and mortality would expectedly be high. We returned to SBA in February 2016 and found that the entire CSL colony was reduced by 77%, relative to the previous year during the same dates (total count: 584 in 2016 vs. 2,555 in 2015). Extremely few live pups were found at the archipelago (343 in 2016 vs. 1,567 in 2015) and most of those that were present were severely emaciated and weak. An unusual high number of carcasses were also recorded. It is too early to understand the impacts that the abnormal oceanographic conditions will have on CSL pups later in their life, but based on life-history theory, their fitness would expectedly be poor. Furthermore, as the high SST conditions encompassed the northeastern Pacific, the entire CSL population could be impacted, as has been reported for other pinnipeds during past El Niño events [10].In conclusion, we have shown that abrupt and unexpected environmental changes can affect key physiological components. The observed effects of the abnormally high SST linked to The Blob and El Niño are unlikely to be limited to the CSL; the entire northeastern Pacific ecosystem could potentially be vulnerable. Under the current climatic scenario, systematic surveys within this region would be invaluable to determine the full scope of effects and assess their wider and long-term consequences.']"
2017-07-17T00:00:00Z,Impact of maternal body mass index and gestational weight gain on neonatal outcomes among healthy Middle-Eastern females,"['The developmental origins of many chronic diseases begin during the embryonic phases due to the interactions between the maternal health status and the genotypic variations, thus the importance of adequate weight of pregnant females to prevent future illnesses of offspring’s. Gaining “too much” or “too little” throughout pregnancy represent another significant danger for both the mother and the baby. In the light of the rising prevalence of overweight and obesity worldwide, it’s not surprising that women of childbearing age are among the first line victims too. Our results revealed significant negative neonatal outcomes when women start their pregnancy with an inadequate BMI; thus, nutritional counseling by health care professionals is crucial to reach an optimal BMI before conception when planning a pregnancy and monitor GWG throughout gestation. Since pregnancy is recognized as an ideal time for education and intervention, pregnant women would be strongly motivated to adopt a healthier lifestyle for the benefit of the fetus.Future researches will aim at evaluating growth velocity and development of newborns that were included in this study, evaluate maternal postpartum weight retention and childhood obesity and at enrolling a larger sample of women from different Lebanese regions in prospective studies in order as well as studying the impact of new variables such as dietary intake and physical activity, in addition to BMI and GWG on maternal and neonatal outcomes. Collaborations should be planned on national level and with neighboring countries to monitor these aspects related to feto-maternal health, to improve the health outcomes of future generations.']"
2016-03-08T00:00:00Z,Guano-Derived Nutrient Subsidies Drive Food Web Structure in Coastal Ponds,"['In focusing on the ecological response of coastal ponds to guano input, this study has pinpointed a marked 15N enrichment of the subsidized biota, confirming that seabird-derived nutrients were recycled in the planktonic and benthic compartments across trophic levels. The overall food web response to guanotrophication was a long-lasting erosion of the benthic pathway in favour of the planktonic one, especially when guano input was higher. Primary consumers, mostly generalist deposit feeders, showed consistent trophic switches as an adaptation to the differing availability, and presumably nutritional quality, of organic matter sources. Secondary consumers had a more omnivorous feeding regime and triggered the coupling of planktonic and benthic pathways in the subsidized pond. Community-trophic niche width varied according to guanotrophication seasonality: it narrowed and widened when guanotrophication increased and decreased respectively. In contrast, the similarity of food chain length among all ponds may be due to the opposite effect of disturbance due to intense guanotrophication and increased primary productivity, rather than to homogeneity in the ecosystem processes among ponds.To conclude, assessment of food web structure and metrics revealed different ecosystem processes and dynamics between ponds, as an effect of the differing ornithogenic subsidies. In particular, seasonal variability in the isotopic metrics was associated with changes in guanotrophication, indicating a detrimental condition when the trophic effects of guano input intensify.Lastly, the study of a food web influenced by continuous seabird nutrient subsidies contributes to a better understanding of the potential role of seabirds in aquatic ecosystems, an issue which has until now been overlooked.']"
2016-03-01T00:00:00Z,Content and Composition of Branched-Chain Fatty Acids in Bovine Milk Are Affected by Lactation Stage and Breed of Dairy Cow,"['U.S. American nutrition guidelines state that most dairy product choices should be fat-free or reduced-fat, based on the potentially detrimental health effects of SFA [64]. Nonetheless, there is no conclusive evidence that whole milk consumption is harmful to human health [7]. The reduced intake of milk fat in response to these guidelines may result in consumers lacking in various bioactive FA provided by whole-fat dairy products. The profile and content of bioactive FA in milk varies with stage of lactation and breed. A serving of whole milk from HO cows has a higher content of RA, anteiso-15:0, iso-17:0, and n-3 FA (at 5 DIM) than milk from JE cows. Overall, milk from cows at 5 DIM had a higher content of n-3 FA, VA, CLA, iso-17:0, and 17:0. This research suggests that HO cows have a more desirable FA profile from a human health standpoint on a per serving basis, although the numeric difference in total bioactive FA (n-3, VA, CLA, and OBCFA) is modest (281 vs. 253 mg per serving for HO and JE cows, respectively). Regardless of breed, stage of lactation was the predominant factor affecting bioactive FA, with milk from cows at 5 DIM containing a higher amount of bioactive FA than cows at 275 DIM on a per serving basis (340 vs. 240 and 253 mg/serving for 5, 185, and 275 DIM, respectively). Additional research is needed to elucidate the mechanism of the shifts in the milk OBCFA to in order to develop dairy products with an enhanced profile.']"

For improving the three indexes, the mixed substrate composed of rice husk carbon and vermiculite with the volume ratio 1:1 was the best when mixed again with surface soil at the ratio of 30%. The mixed substrate of turfy soil and perlite could effectively enhance the soil moisture content, while the mixed substrate of rice husk carbon and vermiculite could improve the nutritive element content of soil. Plants also reflected obvious regularities of distribution on soil factor gradients. Three obvious cluster groups were presented, of which the first cluster was distributed at the places with a relatively higher content of AK and AP; the second cluster was distributed at the places with relatively higher soil moisture content; and the third cluster of plants didn’t have any obvious relationship with soil physical and chemical properties. Through CCA ordination analysis, AK and AP were considered the most important soil factors. By linear multivariate regression analysis, the correlation coefficients between the AK, AP and the growth height and density were relatively high and significant. The linear regression equation was also significant with P< 0.05, and the equations were: growth height = 142.728 − 1.514TC + 30.218AP − 5.083TN + 10.839AK + 1.234mc; density = 68.216 − 4.609TC + 9.566AP − 35.492TN + 19.779AK − 1.591mc.']"
2018-02-14T00:00:00Z,Mapping human vulnerability to climate change in the Brazilian Amazon: The construction of a municipal vulnerability index,"['The results presented here are a pioneering attempt to evaluate the social-environmental and health vulnerability of the population of the state of Amazonas to the impacts of climate change. The major contributions of this study are the development of a set of indicators adapted to the reality of Brazil and the mapping of the vulnerabilities of the municipalities of the state of Amazonas using a climatic perspective. The results have shown that a first step towards making the population of Amazonas better prepared to cope with climate impacts would be the improvement of their life and health conditions, as poverty was one of the factors that most influenced the current vulnerability of the municipalities.Another important step towards improving adaptive capacity is to invest in the infrastructure of municipalities, such as health care networks and disaster preparedness, since drought and flood events for the Amazon region may become more frequent and intense. Although this does not represent a greater risk of death to the local population, which is already adapted in many ways, a greater severity of climate events implies a threat to food and the nutritional security of the region. The dependency of the smallholder on the river flood regime, which determines not only the appropriate time for farming and the viable crops, but also the flow of goods between the small cities and Manaus, is evidence of how harmful a change in rainfall and hydrological patterns of the Amazon Basin could be.The methodology applied was developed to be simple and easy to implement so that it could be appropriated by decision-makers at municipal and state levels. The methodology allowed the interpretation of vulnerability in a synthetic manner and the targeting of resources and actions according to regional peculiarities. In the future, this method is likely to be applied to other Amazonian states of Brazil that share the same socio-spatial characteristics as the municipalities of the state of Amazonas.']"
2017-09-05T00:00:00Z,Can heat waves change the trophic role of the world’s most invasive crayfish? Diet shifts in Procambarus clarkii,"['Our results support those from other taxonomic groups, suggesting that temperature modulates the nutrient intake and the feeding preferences of omnivorous ectotherms, illustrating how these may develop under new climates. Given the positive effects on growth of the assimilation of plant material at higher temperatures, it is possible that diet regulation may help P. clarkii to cope with increased heat stress from longer heat waves in the future. While unlikely to boost P. clarkii’s Mediterranean populations, the changes projected in the severity, frequency and duration of heat waves may alter its trophic niche, especially in the juvenile stage, aggravating both its ecological impact on aquatic vegetation and economic damage to rice fields. This crayfish is known to act as a keystone species and changes in its functional role may echo through the whole food web, opening new trophic pathways or closing previously existing ones, possibly affecting its nutritional value to predators, its predatory impact upon macroinvertebrates and its grazing impact upon macrophytes [71]. Such modifications may even reshape the ecosystem function of the freshwaters inhabited by this alien invader, as macrophyte consumption by P. clarkii has been linked to shifts to alternative stable states with turbid water [72]. Finally, the tendencies in our results with P. clarkii suggest that the climatic changes projected for the near future may potentially drive significant changes in the most predominant impacts of other invasive alien species and warrants monitoring of the world’s ectothermic invaders and their consumptive impacts.']"
2016-10-21T00:00:00Z,"Diversity in Secondary Metabolites Including Mycotoxins from Strains of Aspergillus Section Nigri Isolated from Raw Cashew Nuts from Benin, West Africa","['The diversity in secondary metabolites including mycotoxins from isolates of Aspergillus section Nigri, analysed using UHPLC-QTOF-MS, revealed several metabolites produced by 7 different species that contaminated cashew nuts samples from Benin. In pure cultures on a laboratory medium, ochratoxin A and fumonisins, the 2 main toxic compounds from black Aspergilli, were produced by strains of 2 predominant species in A. section Nigri, namely A. niger / A. welwitchiae and A. carbonarius, although A. carbonarius is unable to produce fumonisins. Ochratoxins and fumonisins were produced by a relatively little proportion of the isolates of A. niger and A. carbonarius, but it is well know that species of A. section Nigri are the most isolated on cashew kernels, given a substantial number of species that may produce mycotoxins in cashew nuts. Even though the presence of fungi has not always meant the presence of mycotoxins, the production of ochratoxin A and fumonisins by isolates on A. section Nigri on cashew nuts could constitute an additional and hidden problem in term of mycotoxins content, and can negatively affect cashew nut safety and the nutritional quality of the nuts.There are no regulations on ochratoxin A and fumonisins for raw and processed cashew nuts like those of EU and WHO on aflatoxins. Nevertheless, these findings suggest more investigations in order to detect the presence and the levels of ochratoxin A and fumonisins and to evaluate their exact contribution to the total level of mycotoxins in cashew kernels. But immediate actions should emphasize on the prevention by strengthening post-harvest practices that can lower fungal contamination along the cashew nut value chain, mainly during nut storage, where high contamination of species belonging to black Aspergilli are noticed.']"
2013-08-12T00:00:00Z,Application of Artificial Neural Networks to Investigate One-Carbon Metabolism in Alzheimer’s Disease and Healthy Matched Individuals,"['The present study represents the first attempt to use ANNs the understand folate metabolism in AD and healthy matched control subjects, and reveals the importance to evaluate this pathway as a whole rather than to take into consideration its components one at once. Among 30 initial variables of the pathway, 16 of them seem to contain significant information to discriminate between AD and control subjects in our cohort, and the semantic connectivity map here generated reveals both already known and novel connections among variables and disease risk (Figure 3). Of particular interest are variables, such as TYMS and DNMT3B genotypes, that albeit not previously detected in genetic association studies might play a significant contribution when considering the complexity of interactions with other variables of this pathway. Though we achieved good results using ANNs for our small dataset, results are not necessarily generalizable to other populations but need to be validated independently in future studies. Differences might arise from a population to another one, due to different dietary habits or to a different distribution of the studied polymorphisms and other geographic factors. However, our system is able to understand the connections among studied variables and those of relevance in a particular dataset. The addiction of other variables, such as brain volume, DNA methylation content, DNA damage, and so on, coupled with the possibility to graphically visualize the strengths of connections among all the studied variables, could be a helpful and timely tool to unravel the link between folate metabolism and AD, particularly in a period when nutritional supplementation has been often suggested as a preventative strategy to delay epigenetic modifications linked to the onset of age-related disease such as AD [69].']"
2014-12-30T00:00:00Z,Genome-Wide Identification and Comprehensive Analyses of the Kinomes in Four Pathogenic Microsporidia Species,"['Microsporidian kinomes consist of the AGC, CAMK, CMGC, CK1, STE, Other, and Atypical groups, but lack RGC, TK and TKL groups. Their ePKs catalytic domains, critical amino acid residues and motifs are relatively conserved. Some kinases involved in nutrition and energy signaling, and stress responses, were lost. But genes related to cell cycle, development and growth were well conserved.Our results revealed the following novel findings: 1), the N. ceranae kinome (27 ePKs and 4 aPKs) except E. cuniculi, is the smallest eukaryotic kinome characterized to date; 2), microsporidian kinome size reduction is in good agreement with proteome compaction, albeit with increased kinome densities accompanying proteome reduction; 3), microsporidia share 35 subfamilies with the fly and human kinomes, 33 with the worm, and 25 with the yeast. Nearly three-quarters of the kinase subfamilies from a common ancestor were lost in the microsporidia including some critical kinases in metabolism, apoptosis, cellular proliferation, differentiation, mitotic progression, cytokinesis and morphogenesis process; 4), the coevolution of microsporidia and their hosts is not reflected in protein kinases. In both the mammal- and insect-pathogenic microsporidia, no remarkable differences were observed in kinase family distribution, domain architecture, key amino acid residues, gene gain and loss, or selective pressure.In conclusion, our results further enriched and updated the microsporidian protein kinase database, provide some valuable information for future functional investigations of protein kinase gene family for drugs identify candidates to control pathogenic diseases.']"
2015-06-02T00:00:00Z,Direct Effects of Microalgae and Protists on Herring (Clupea harengus) Yolk Sac Larvae,"['The role of microplankton organisms have largely been overlooked in studies examining early feeding in marine fish larvae (the ‘protozooplankton-ichthyoplankton link’, [46,47]) despite laboratory studies demonstrating that larvae pursue, attack and consume microplankton [48–50], and field studies reporting that protists can form a large portion of the gut contents of marine fish larvae [49,51]. In this study, the duration of the ‘window of opportunity’ for first-feeding was ~3-fold greater in herring larvae reared in the presence compared to the absence of phytoplankton and an heterotrophic protist. When naïve larvae were exposed to copepod nauplii, larvae reared with algae and protists attacked prey more frequently than those reared in only seawater. The presence of microalgae and dinoflagellates did not change the trajectory of growth or life span but the precocious feeding may have important implications when larger micro- and meso-zooplankton are available. Precocious feeding is likely important to growth and survival of marine fish larvae and there are potential nutritional benefits/decrements for larvae foraging on larger prey (copepods) which have consumed different types of algae and protists. Therefore, we recommend that future studies examining the role of algae and protists on yolk sac larvae include additional treatments with larger prey (copepods) and that measurements be extended into the exogenous feeding period. Furthermore, to adequately assess match-mismatch dynamics of larvae in the field, measurements of microalgae and protists should be integrated within routine monitoring programs as well as both indirect markers such as stable isotopes [51] and direct markers such as proteomics or genetic analyses of gut contents [52].']"

All perturbations induced pronounced shifts in metabolism that were consistent with the phenotype observed by established clinical biomarkers and an in vivo imaging analysis. The diabetic state in obese rats was associated with hyperglycemia and decreased amino acids levels, reflecting stimulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis, dyslipidemia and elevated β-oxidation. As mass spectrometry achieves a resolution to single components rather than capturing whole classes, subtle differences in metabolite profiles, e.g. between short chain, long chain and polyunsaturated fatty acids, or between amino acid subclasses could be detected. Most of the biochemical signatures of diabetes were reversed by pioglitazone, underlining the broad impact of PPARγ activation that is overall beneficial for metabolic parameters. With 420 biochemicals in serum, 443 in liver and 603 in intestine, the study represents the most detailed metabolomic investigation of the ZDF rat model and of TZD effects reported so far. It deepens the understanding of the ZDF rat model and provides an extensive dataset that can serve to pinpoint similarities and differences on the metabolite level between the ZDF rat and humans with diabetes. Overall, the metabolite alterations in major biochemical pathways further validate the ZDF rat as a suitable preclinical model of diabetes in humans. For an enhanced understanding of the observed change patterns, a system-oriented view, built by linking metabolite levels with the transcriptional regulation of their biosynthesis and catabolism might be a fruitful extension for future studies.']"
2018-07-31T00:00:00Z,Detection of new pathways involved in the acceptance and the utilisation of a plant-based diet in isogenic lines of rainbow trout fry,"['Isogenic lines constitute a relevant biological material in this study as the reduced variability within each line enhances the statistical power to detect differences among groups. The transcriptomic approach, without a priori hypothesis, allowed us to set up a list of molecular markers which may play a role in the acceptance and utilisation of plant-based diets at an early stage, known as a critical rearing phase [22, 24]. Only analysis on whole fry are feasible at this highly important stage, possibly hiding some effects on specific organs [28] and further analyses will be needed on specific organs to strengthen our findings.Nevertheless, we were able to identify an important number of molecular markers linked to the utilisation of a plant-based diet. Moreover, the comparison of three isogenic lines with two genotypes performing better with plant-based diets (R23h and AB1h) than the third one (A22h) reveals different pathways, showing that there are different possible strategies to optimise utilisation of such diets.Several of these genes had been previously identified in other studies and we confirm their potential role in the utilisation of a plant-based diet (immunity, sulfur-containing AA metabolism). In addition, we found new genes, several of which are linked to sensory perception and appetite regulation. Pathways linked to vision, olfaction and feed intake regulation had previously been mentioned in a transcriptomic analysis that studied the nutritional programming of plant-based diets acceptance in RBT [25]. These convergent data strongly suggest that sensory perception is a key determinant of the acceptance of plant-based diets at an early stage. Studying sensory perception mechanisms and the regulation of feed intake by dietary factors should help improve the formulation of plant-based diets, thus improving performance of fish fed diets devoid of marine ingredients.']"
2017-02-03T00:00:00Z,Characterisation of zinc delivery from a nipple shield delivery system using a breastfeeding simulation apparatus,"['Delivery of zinc from tablets using the NSDS was shown as feasible using a breastfeeding simulation apparatus. During the simulations, zinc was released into breast milk pumped through the breastfeeding simulation apparatus under physiologically relevant fluid flow conditions. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry was demonstrated as a successful method for detecting the zinc released into the breast milk. This detection technique can be applied to future human nutrition and drug delivery studies.Administration of zinc from each of four rapidly disintegrating zinc tablet types used in the NSDS was tested. Of the tested tablets, the total zinc release of tablets of differing hardness but the same compositions was not significantly different from one another based on unpaired t tests using Welch’s correction. Further, for tablets of differing composition but similar hardness the total zinc release was not significantly different from another by the same test.Future work could include testing the efficacy of zinc delivery over a wider range of potential breastfeeding conditions by modifying the tested milk composition, suction rates, and milk flow rates. Alternative tablet compositions, sizes, hardness, or API dosages could also be tested. Furthermore, other dosage forms could be tested with the NSDS. Other NSDS designs could also be investigated to alter the fluid flow through the device and therefore potentially the release properties of the loaded dosage form.There is a strong need for increased paediatric zinc supplementation and therapeutic availability. If scaled up globally and optimised, the NSDS could potentially be used to administer this nutrient, which could be an influential method of decreasing child mortality, especially due to two of the leading preventable causes of death, pneumonia and diarrheal disease [29].']"

Besides the phenological appraisal of biomass and nutrient content, we investigated the changes caused by the fertilizer treatments on the polar metabolites extracted from maize plants and detected by both GC-MS and 1H NMR techniques.All applied treatments with different P sources were very effective in influencing both the metabolic profiles and the P uptake of treated plants. However, the metabolic responses varied with the type of P fertilizer and whether or not the amendments were conducted in combination with the Trichoderma inoculum.In particular, the combined use of Trichoderma OmG-08 and compost (B2P3 and B2P4), significantly improved the plant P uptake and the abundance of metabolites related to photosynthesis with positive repercussions on the produced shoots dry biomass, as compared to controls (B0P3, B0P4). However, the noted differences in shoot dry weight and P content for B2P3 samples in respect to B2P4 plants, suggest that there was also a different response of maize plants to the type of applied compost due to a varied molecular composition.Conversely when combined with mineral fertilizers, the Trichoderma OmG-08 negatively affect the plants growth. Also the metabolic and the nutritional parameters observed in B2P1 and B2P2 treatments were worse than for B0P1 and B0P2. The B2P0 plants were found to be adversely influenced by the inoculation with Trichoderma, most probably because of the competition for the available rhizosphere nutrients between plants and microorganism.Hence, our results confirm that the combination of Trichoderma OmG-08 with composts fertilizer may provide a valuable alternative to satisfy the plant P demand, thus reducing the use of the scarce and environmentally unsustainable mineral P fertilizers.']"
2019-07-18T00:00:00Z,Identifying performance benchmarks and determinants for reproductive performance and calf survival using a longitudinal field study of cow-calf herds in western Canada,"['For future studies of reproductive performance in client-owned herds, we suggest focussing effort on the accurate collection of pregnancy testing data, stillbirth and calf loss information. Investigators should work with producers to encourage more complete reporting of abortion losses and consistently reporting calf death losses within meaningful categories for age at death rather than just reporting all losses between 24 hours of age and weaning. While the present study was not based on a random sample of all cow-calf producers, the results are most applicable to cow-calf clients of veterinary practices and the data were comparable to previous reports from western Canada. Future studies should also focus on accurate and specific production information for defined periods of risk for calf loss (i.e. within 24 hours of birth, 24 hours to 1 month) as compared to summarizing all losses from birth to weaning. Reporting bias due to sales and purchases of cattle are less likely to be an issue in defined periods during the calving season as compared to later during and after the breeding season.The percentiles reported when summarizing individual production metrics can be used by veterinarians and producers to benchmark herd performance, to set realistic goals for improvement and to define thresholds requiring diagnostic investigation. The finding of greater variation among herds in heifer performance than among cows suggests opportunities for improvement in heifer management. The finding that later breeding and calving herds were more at risk for poor pregnancy percentages provides documentation of a problem suspected by producers and veterinarians and will require further investigation to determine the best way to minimize the nutritional challenges of getting cows pregnant later in the growing season.']"

Our studies did not address the physiological or molecular mechanisms of erythritol toxicity. In some insects, ingested erthritol can inhibit uptake of nutritive sugars through the gut wall [11]. Ingestion of erythritol may alter nutrient and/or water absorption and/or efflux.However, erythritol in tissues is not always toxic to arthropods. For example, some insect species that are seasonally exposed to freezing conditions produce erythritol and other polyhydric alcohols as tissue cryoprotectants [12], [13]. Larvae of one antarctic midge can safely ingest erythritol from food plants and sequester it for adult cryoprotection [14]. Toxic effects of ingested erythritol may be dose-dependent, as our data suggest.Of note, erythritol is not the only sweetener known to be toxic to insects. For example, mannose has been shown to be toxic in honey bees [15], [16]. However, mannose was not toxic to Drosophila melanogaster or to Ceratitis capitata [15]. Further study will be required to determine if erythritol is toxic to other insect species.A large body of literature has shown that erythritol consumption by humans is very well tolerated [5], [17]–[19], and indeed, large amounts of both erythritol and Truvia are being consumed by humans every day throughout the world. Taken together, our data set the stage for investigating this compound as a novel, effective, and human safe approach for insect pest control. We suggest targeted bait presentations to fruit crop and urban insect pests are particularly promising.']"

Some of these DEGs have previously been shown to be closely related to Ggt pathogenicity, but many have not been previously associated with Ggt and are promising candidates for further investigation. To the best our knowledge, this study is the first to use Illumina deep sequencing technology to compare the entire transcriptome of Ggt growing saprophytically in culture to Ggt grwoing parasitically in wheat roots. qRT-PCR of a small number of the DEGs showed that expression can be very specific to certain times during the infection, and some DEGs may play specific roles either early or late in the disease.The use of fungal genomics and transcriptomics has started to make major contributions to identifying genes required for pathogenesis, such as those related to signaling, penetration, fungal nutrition and host colonization [61]. The results of this study has contributed to advancing our knowledge of this pathosystem by revealing that Ggt preferentially expresses a considerable number of genes during parasitic growth in roots to signal changes in its environment as it colonizes the root, to combat host resistance mechanisms related to cell wall appositions and antimicrobial compounds, as well as to degrade the plant cell walls, possibly both for obtaining nutrients and allowing for growth of its hyphae through the root tissues. Ultimately, targeting these candidate virulence genes by further analysis, such as gene disruption, will result in a better understanding of these virulence mechanisms of Ggt, which may lead to improving its control resulting in higher yields of wheat and other crop hosts of Ggt worldwide']"
2016-11-02T00:00:00Z,"Exposure to a Highly Caloric Palatable Diet during the Perinatal Period Affects the Expression of the Endogenous Cannabinoid System in the Brain, Liver and Adipose Tissue of Adult Rat Offspring","['The data demonstrate that exposure to a maternal palatable diet since the preconception period predisposes animals to develop features of metabolic syndrome, and affect the feeding behavior, including the differential response to the inverse cannabinonid agonist AM251, and the expression of genes involved in cannabinoid and lipid metabolism of the offspring in a sex-specific manner, even though the animals are weaned on standard chow diet. The increased expression of Cnr1 in the hypothalamus and PAT of PC female offspring suggest a hyposensitization of the cannabinoid activity, which may result in a reduction in chocolate preference, leptinemia and body weight at adulthood. However, the decreased expression of Pparγ and the eCBs-degrading enzymes Faah and Mgll in the liver of PC females suggest a hypersensitization of the PPARγ/cannabinoid receptor activity (Cnr1 showed a tendency to decrease), which may result in an alteration of fatty acid uptake, cholesterol profile and hepatic transaminases. The decreased expression of the NAEs-degrading enzyme Faah and the AGs-synthesizing enzyme Daglβ in the PAT of PC males suggest an increase in the AEA tone and a decrease in the 2-AG tone, which may finally result in an increase in de novo lipogenesis (Acaca) in PAT and a decrease in the lipid uptake (Pparγ) in the liver, as well as perirenal adiposity and leptinemia. These outcomes are independent of the postnatal diet. These results emphasize the importance of nutritional conditions during these critical windows in the development of the abnormal phenotype exhibited by offspring in a sex-dependent manner. Therefore, we propose that the perinatal exposure to a highly palatable food could program the energy metabolism and feeding behavior by different mechanisms that include the affectation of the ECS. Whether the dysregulation found in the ECS could increase the vulnerability for developing diseases in presence of deleterious dietetic or hormone conditions must be addressed in future studies.']"
2015-07-02T00:00:00Z,Spatial Patterns and Temperature Predictions of Tuna Fatty Acids: Tracing Essential Nutrients and Changes in Primary Producers,"['We developed a framework that can quantify and predict the spatial and temporal variability of various fatty acid parameters measured in the tissues of large commercially important marine predators. Using this framework we found that the supply and availability of EFA are likely to be negatively affected by increases in sea surface temperature, particularly in temperate environments. The changes in fatty acid proportions and concentrations reflect shifts in phytoplankton dynamics, including species composition and size structure, and describe mechanisms by which marine energy pathways and ecosystem stability could change. The models presented can be used to infer the fatty acid composition of other generalist marine top predators with similar movement patterns and metabolic parameters. They can also be used to understand potential future impacts driven by natural and anthropogenic climate change. Indicators of climate change are thought to be important in planning adaptation strategies for harvested marine species [72]. Indeed, measuring the fatty acid composition and content of regularly fished resources offers a cost effective approach to understand trophic structure dynamics and their response to change. International efforts are now needed to assess broad, global-scale patterns in marine fatty acids similar to that being undertaken for isotopes [73] and trace elements [74].Assessing and monitoring entire ecosystem dynamics from nutrient inputs to top predators is notoriously difficult, largely because there are very few methods that can detect multi-scale and food web integrated signals [75]. As fatty acids are derived from primary producers and are essential for marine organisms to grow, reproduce and survive, they provide excellent tools to simultaneously examine bottom-up drivers of energy transfer, trophic structure and nutritional condition or health at the organismal and community scales.']"
2017-05-18T00:00:00Z,Human plasma metabolomics in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,"['Our results demonstrate for the first time that plasma NMR metabolomics of patients with AMD detects small changes in the levels of selected amino acids and organic acids, as well as particular lipid moieties and protein levels. The changes observed are not very robust, but appear to be associated with the presence of the disease and its severity, rather than age, based on the identification of the particular age-dependent metabolite sets in each cohort. Other potential confounders (gender, smoking history, BMI, comorbidities) were also found not to affect the proposed AMD signatures significantly. Furthermore, the AMD-specific metabolite variations detected were found to partially differ between the two cohorts (Coimbra, Portugal and Boston, US), thus indicating that nutritional and other lifestyle habits may be determining the metabolic response in AMD in different regions. A particularly important result of this study is that, in each cohort, a subgroup of metabolite changes tended to differentiate the controls from the patients diagnosed with early AMD stage (namely acetate, creatine, dimethyl sulfone, cholesterol, HDL-choline and unsaturated fatty acids for Coimbra subjects, and albumin, histidine, glutamine and also unsaturated fatty acids for Boston subjects). This is an important observation that needs to be further investigated since it may contribute to the future definition of AMD biomarkers.In summary, our results suggest that even though the overall metabolite changes detected in relation to AMD in both cohorts are of low magnitude and weak statistical relevance, they appear to be AMD-specific and should, therefore, be explored further in expanded cohorts and with methodologies targeting the metabolic domains of the specific compounds identified. This work has the potential to offer novel biomarkers for AMD, as well as to improve the current understanding of the pathogenesis of this blinding disease.']"

In this study we propose for the first time a full characterization of the complete casein cluster through the transcripts analysis of the four llama casein genes. The sequence of the correctly assembled transcripts allowed us to establish the exonic structure of each gene.Exons skipping and duplication events were evidenced. We were able to identify two variants A (215 amino acids) and B (207 amino acids) in the αs1-casein gene as result of the alternative out-splicing of the exon 18, which opens the possibility for further genetic studies. No splicing were evidenced in the β- and αs2-casein, although in the latter one extra exon was found through the comparison with the dromedary camel sequence. A cryptic exon of 43 bp was found in the κ-casein. This finding is particularly interesting because it leads to have two possible ATG (Methionine) as translation start codon.The characterization at cDNA level of llama casein is fundamental for the detection of genetic variability, for studies involving the identification of protein variants as well as post translational modifications. In this regard, the differences predicted in the pI might be responsible for different migration patterns for the llama casein fractions in iso-electro-focusing (IEF) experiments. Therefore, the information herein reported might be helpful to establish new IEF standards in llama and useful for the identification of protein variants.This work adds fundamental knowledge on the molecular basis of milk protein genes in llamas and can be useful for the understanding of the evolution of casein genes especially in Camelidae. Future studies will allow to figure out the functional characteristics (nutritional and dietetic) of this milk to better meet the food requirements of rural population, but also for the newborn offspring.']"
2019-12-16T00:00:00Z,"Effect of Iodine treatments on Ocimum basilicum L.: Biofortification, phenolics production and essential oil composition","['In our study, basil emerged as a good target for iodine biofortification, as the plant was able to efficiently uptake and translocate large amounts of the element, which were stored in the leaves in a dose-dependent manner. The higher assimilation rate of iodide comparing to iodate was confirmed in both the open field and the growth chamber trials, and, following the adopted biofortification protocol, the optimal concentrations to be used should range between 0.1 mM and 1 mM. At those values, the yield was not compromised and the iodine content in leaves fitted into the recommended daily intakes established for human beings, considering the low amount of basil leaves that can enter human diet either directly as a culinary herb or after processing.Plant nutritional value was positively affected by the iodine treatments, as an increase of leaf antioxidant power and phenolic compounds’ accumulation, especially RA and cinnamic acid, was observed in KI and KIO3 treated plants. Nevertheless, a substantial alteration of these nutraceuticals was obtained only with concentrations of the iodine salts between 1 and 10 mM, which in turn induced yield reduction, phytotoxicity symptoms and an excessive iodine accumulation. Administration of 1 mM KI could anyway represent a good compromise between the biofortification purpose and a moderate enrichment of antioxidant compounds in basil leaves.The EO composition was influenced by both iodine form treatments in a dose-dependent fashion in the growth chamber set-up, with large changes in the volatiles production and even shifts in the chemotype among the samples. On the contrary, the chemotype of the open field basil was not influenced at any treatment concentration and the differences that were registered among the treatments were subtle and could not alter the overall distribution of the main EOs fractions between control and iodine-treated plants.']"
2014-06-10T00:00:00Z,Integrative Analyses of Hepatic Differentially Expressed Genes and Blood Biomarkers during the Peripartal Period between Dairy Cows Overfed or Restricted-Fed Energy Prepartum,"['The use of additional blood biomarkers and novel bioinformatics tools for the analysis of published transcriptomics data provided a more holistic understanding of the role of plane of nutrition during late-pregnancy on hepatic adaptations around the period of parturition. An all-encompassing dynamic model using these data is reported in Figure 7. Overfeeding energy prepartum enhances body fat deposition, partly in response to chronic hyperinsulinemia, which leads to more pronounced and sustained increase in blood NEFA postpartum and greater TAG accumulation in liver at least in part by reducing lipid catabolism and partly due to “dampened” PPARα activation. Despite such response, in overfed cows there was an attempt to counterbalance these negative effects by reducing Notch signaling and activating other cellular pathways of which cell cycle and ECM receptor interaction would likely help the liver repair from cellular damage (suggested by higher blood bilirubin and, numerically, GGT). On the contrary, although cows fed restricted energy appeared to catabolize substantially more muscle mass prepartum, their liver was able to adapt to the higher postpartal metabolic state well-ahead of parturition. This adaptation was likely driven by molecular processes partly controlled by transcription regulators such as PPARA and NFE2L2, of importance in fatty acid oxidation and cellular stress. As a result, restricted-fed cows had signs of greater metabolic flux and utilization of amino acids and fatty acids but also of a more pronounced cellular inflammatory and ER-stress response. Most of those cellular adaptations were confirmed by biomarker analysis specifically during the prepartal period, which strengthened the notion that restricted-energy helped “prime” the liver to cope with the change in physiological state at the onset of lactation.10.1371/journal.pone.0099757.g007Figure 7\nAll-encompassing dynamic model proposed based on the main findings from the study.\nReported are differential effects of the diet prepartum on adipose tissue, muscle, and liver (depicted by yellow round cells, image of a muscle section, and draw of a stylized liver, respectively). Red (text, lines, symbols and bars in graphs, and arrows) denotes facts that are more pronounced in cows overfed [OF] compared to cows underfed [RE] energy prepartum. Dark blue denotes facts that are more prominent in cows fed energy restricted diet prepartum compared to cows overfed energy prepartum. Data from representative plasma parameters are indicated by bars graphs with fold differences in overfed vs. restricted energy prepartum cows in Y-axis. Data from representative pathways from the Dynamic Impact Approach are shown as lines and scatter plots with the Direction of the Impact in Y-axis. In all cases the X-axis denotes the day relative to parturition. The dotted vertical purple line in all graphs denotes the end of treatment coinciding also with parturition. Solid lines and arrows denote flow of molecules/metabolites. Dotted lines and arrows denote effect. In all cases ⊕ denotes larger activation/amount and ⊖ denote larger inhibition. In text / denote larger or lower in the treatment indicated by the font color (red \u200a=\u200a overfed and blue \u200a=\u200a feed restricted) compared to the other treatment. In the light-yellow background round shapes are reported main transcriptional factors potentially involved in controlling the transcriptomics adaptation of the indicated pathways. Summary explanation of the model is reported in the conclusion section of the paper.\nClearly, there is a carryover effect of plane of nutrition during late-pregnancy that will result in molecular and physiological adaptations during lactation. Our data support the view of a more robust liver in restricted-fed cows to face the metabolic and inflammatory challenges typical of the early postpartal period. As such, the transcriptomics data provide evidence that plane of dietary energy during late-pregnancy can help prime the liver for the onset of lactation.']"
2019-10-15T00:00:00Z,Consumer beliefs about healthy foods and diets,"['This report conveys the results of a nationwide survey of 1,290 U.S. food consumers, with primary focus on consumers’ perceptions of healthy food. The FDA has signaled efforts to re-define the terms for use on food labels, and as such, insights into how consumers define and interpret has been sought by the FDA [28].Slightly more consumers than not thought a food could be deemed healthy based solely on the foods’ nutritional content. However, it was also the case that slightly more consumers than not thought healthiness is a characteristic of one’s overall diet and the combination of foods consumed rather than something that can be determined looking at individual foods. There were four broad types of consumers with about a quarter falling into each of four categories of views about healthy: food-nutrient focus, food-nonnutritive focus, diet-nutrient focus, and diet-nonnutritive focus. Such findings presenting something of a challenge because “healthy” labels appear on individual foods rather than on combinations of foods (i.e. an overall diet). Given that roughly half of consumers view “healthy” as a purview of one’s over-all diet rather than a specific food, it suggests food-specific healthy labels may be less impactful for a significant portion of the population. Moreover, current “healthy” labels are based exclusively on a food’s nutrient content, which according to half this survey sample, is insufficient to determine whether a food, for them, is considered healthy.Ratings of individual food products according to healthiness reveals that “healthy” is not a single unifying construct, but rather consumers evaluate healthiness along a number of different dimensions or factors related to animal origin, preservation, and freshness/processing. Focusing on individual nutrients, perceived healthiness is generally decreasing in a food’s fat, sodium, and carbohydrate content and increasing in protein content. Only about 2% of consumers jointly rated high fat and low carbohydrates as the healthiest nutrient combination.About 40% of consumers thought a healthy label implied they should increase consumption of the type of food bearing the label, and indeed about 15% thought the label meant they could eat all they wanted. A little over a third of respondents (34.7%) indicated that a healthy label would not mean anything to them.While a slight majority of consumers (54%) felt the FDA should regulate the use of the term “healthy” by requiring companies to follow a uniform, consistent definition, only about 19% believed the FDA should keep the current definition, raising questions about how–exactly–consumers believe the term should be defined.There are some limitations to the present study. The survey data originate from a non-probability based (or “opt-in”) panel maintained by a marketing research firm. Prior research suggests the accuracy of non-probability internet samples is lower than that of probability based phone or internet samples, although post-stratification weighting sometimes helps reduce inaccuracies [36]. Nonetheless, in recent years use of non-probability based internet samples has expanded rapidly in marketing and academic research as well as political polling [37, 38], and there is evidence that even highly non-representative samples are just as accurate as forecasting election outcomes as more traditional methods [39] and that differences between different probability based samples can be as large as the difference between probability-based and non-probability based samples [40]. The trend toward opt-in online panels may be explained in part by the significantly lower cost of non-probability based samples as well as emerging problems with conventional survey approaches. For example, [41] posits that the difference between opting out of a probability sample (which often have response rates less than 10%) and opting in to a non-probability sample is practically nill (see also [42]). Moreover, the emergence of mobile phones and unlisted numbers has made random-digit dialing techniques less reliable [37] and there has been a significant decline in response rates and data quality even in “high quality” government surveys [43]. The use of post-stratification weights in this study forces the sample to match the population in terms of selected demographic variables, and any degree of inaccuracy arising from the use of a non-probability based sample is unknown.There are a number of avenues for future research. This survey included questions asking about health perceptions of macro nutrients (i.e., fat, protein, carbohydrates). Future research on perceptions of micronutrients such as different types of fats (e.g., saturated vs. unsaturated) or carbohydrates (e.g., whole vs. refined grains; added vs. natural sugars) would also provide useful information relative to health perceptions. It could also be of interest to inquire about other policy preferences. In this study, respondents were asked a broad question about consumer’s perception of the FDA’s role in regulating and defining a claim like “healthy.” It might also be useful, however, to inquire as to whether and how consumers believe, conditional on the fact the FDA already defines healthy, the label definition should be updated over time.Overall, results of this study suggest consumer’s perceptions of “healthy,” which is primarily based on fat content, partially aligns with the FDA definition, but findings also suggest consumers perceive the word as a broader and more nuanced concept that defies easy, uniform definition. Given heterogeneity in beliefs about the definition of healthy, findings from this study suggest such labels may need to be accompanied with nutrition education or that on-package disclosures may need to accompany health claims so that consumers know what, precisely, is being communicated. Nationwide nutrition education around the label claim “healthy” is likely to be costly and results of such a campaign are uncertain. Such considerations point to on-package definitions/disclosures as a more effective means of communicating the federal definition of “healthy.”']"
2015-06-10T00:00:00Z,"Effects of Row-Type, Row-Spacing, Seeding Rate, Soil-Type, and Cultivar Differences on Soybean Seed Nutrition under US Mississippi Delta Conditions","['This research demonstrated that increasing seeding rate resulted in increases of protein, linolenic acid, sucrose, glucose, raffinose, B, and P concentrations on both single- and twin-rows. However, the increase of these constituents became either constant or declined at the higher rates (40 and 50 seeds m–2). A later maturity cultivar (GP 533) accumulated higher seed protein and linolenic acid than the earlier maturity cultivar (94M80) on both row- types under normal conditions of temperature and drought. However, the earlier maturity cultivar (94M80) accumulated higher oil and oleic acid concentrations in seeds. The positive correlation between sucrose and glucose with SR in single- and twin-rows in 2009 and 2010 in clay soil and sandy soil indicated that these sugars were the most influenced by seeding rates, and the negative correlation between SR and stachyose may be due to a possible inverse relationship between stachyose, and sucrose, glucose, and fructose, especially under environmental stress conditions of heat and drought. Since the positive response of seed protein, sugars, and minerals was between 20 and 40 seed m-2, SR beyond 40 seed m-2 may have a negative impact on seed quality as they create inter-plant competition for water and nutrients. Since we used limited cultivars in our study, we cannot generalize the trend of seed nutrients obtained in this experiment to be shown by other cultivars unless a big number of cultivars with different maturity groups and genotypes are used. These results are useful to soybean growers for optimizing agronomic practices for higher seed quality. Since higher seed protein and sugars, especially sucrose, glucose, and fructose, are desirable traits for soybean nutrition and taste, optimizing seeding rate to achieve higher levels of these seed constituents is an important goal for soybean industry, and needs further research.']"

Differences were found when volunteer’s people were at work. Most probably office workers compensate for the lack of physical activity during business hours in their free time.To our knowledge this is the first comparative approach to shift and non-shift workers employed in the health care industry with regard to their physical activity, nutrition, metabolism, chronic stress and sleep. These findings and range of parameters have not been described in a central European cohort yet.Shift-working had no overall effect on physical activity but was associated with different eating habits and greater stress levels. Office workers appear to compensate for less physical activity during work in their off hours.Further studies should enrol a larger sample size and longer periods of monitoring, e.g. four weeks. Advanced developments like smaller and lighter fitness-tracking armbands could be used as actigraphy in future studies to encourage study participation. The relation between shift work and impairment should always be noted by comparing shift-working and non-shift-working study groups of similar working environment (e.g. health-care workers).The amount of MVPA and overall activity measured by METs should be used in future studies due to their clinical relevance and reproducibility.Considering the theoretical foundation of this study—the biopsychosocial model- further studies should also acquire data about e.g. individual education, social status, income etc. By obtaining a larger and more representative sample size, evaluation of shift-work’s retrospective impact on social parameters such as family structure, career could be realized.']"
2013-09-04T00:00:00Z,Metagenomic Profiling Reveals Lignocellulose Degrading System in a Microbial Community Associated with a Wood-Feeding Beetle,"['This study represents the first large scale functional metagenomic analysis of the midgut microbial community of a cerambycid beetle with documented lignin degrading capabilities [8]. A taxonomically diverse assemblage of bacteria and fungi are associated with the midgut of A. glabripennis and this study has shown that this community harbors the enzymatic capacity for extensive contributions to the digestion of woody tissue in this system. Of relevance is i) a microbial community dominated by bacterial and fungal aerobes and facultative anaerobes, indicating an appropriate aerobic environment in the midgut for microbial enzymes involved in oxygen-dependent lignin degradative processes, ii) the similarity of the A. glabripennis midgut microbiota to the Sirex fungal gallery community and its distinction from other herbivore gut communities, including the termite hindgut communities, iii) detection of genes encoding secreted oxidative enzymes proposed to disrupt β-aryl ether linkages and hypothesized to have roles in cleaving β-aryl ether linkages in lignin, iv) detection of extracellular H2O2-generating enzymes, and v) detection of a number of genera with predicted lignocellulolytic and hemicellulolytic capabilities. The midgut community of A. glabripennis has the metabolic potential to produce enzymes to help this wood-boring insect overcome major nutritional challenges associated with feeding in woody tissue and we hypothesize that interactions between the beetle and its gut microbes drive this insect’s ability to colonize and thrive in a broad range of healthy host trees. This wood-degrading system should also have great potential for the development of novel lignocellulose degrading enzymes for applications by the biofuels industry. This study provides the first glimpse into the metabolic potential of the gut community associated with a cerambycid beetle and lays the foundations for future hypothesis-based research, including more in-depth biochemical studies, comparative metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and pathway modeling to assess potential metabolic cross-talk between this beetle and its gut microbes.']"
2015-06-02T00:00:00Z,How Are Physical Activity Behaviors and Cardiovascular Risk Factors Associated with Characteristics of the Built and Social Residential Environment?,"[""While there is increasing evidence for the effect of the built residential characteristics on the PA behavior of individuals, the influence of the social environment and the simultaneous evaluation of multiple risk behaviors/risk factors has received less attention to date. The present study attempted to fill this gap by deliberately including social characteristics in the study design and investigating smoking and nutritional behavior—two central behavioral dimensions of the participants' cardiovascular risk factor profiles-, BMI and fasting blood glucose as well as PA behavior. While the present study does not encompass a complete cardiovascular risk factor profile, we captured many of the most important risk factors and found most of them to be associated with characteristics of the built and social residential environment.While there exists a growing amount of studies investigating possible links between both built and social residential characteristics and PA behavior, the number of articles on the influence of neighborhood characteristics on other cardiovascular risk factors, e.g. BMI or fasting blood glucose, remains small. Future studies should embrace a greater variety of cardiovascular risk behaviors/risk factors in order to elucidate the complete array of (causal) pathways between residential characteristics and risk factors.Moreover, future research should focus on integrating both innovative objective and subjective measures for characteristics of the residential environment. As a majority of the existing evidence documenting associations between characteristics of the residential environment and risk factors as well as risk behaviors is mainly cross-sectional [40], future research should use prospective longitudinal designs or natural experiments in order to be able to acquire knowledge about causal links rather than merely about observed associations. With the ultimate goal of our research in mind—solving real-world problems—future research should last but not least strive to draw conclusions in such a way that they can more easily serve as guidelines for political decision makers.""]"
2015-05-04T00:00:00Z,Metabolic Heat Stress Adaption in Transition Cows: Differences in Macronutrient Oxidation between Late-Gestating and Early-Lactating German Holstein Dairy Cows,"['The objective of the present study was to compare the macronutrient oxidation in late-gestating versus early-lactating dairy cows fed either ad libitum during high ambient temperatures or pair-fed at thermoneutrality. Earlier studies utilizing the pair-feeding approach [12–14] focused on mid-lactating cows which are highly susceptible to heat stress at their maximum of milk production. In contrast, our focus was set on the transition cow, because the transition phase is not only a vulnerable period, but highly determinative for the subsequent lactation. To gain novel insights into the oxidative metabolism of different macronutrients during heat stress and pair-feeding beyond the level of metabolite analysis, we applied the technique of indirect calorimetry. We could demonstrate that fat oxidation is not affected by heat-induced reduction of feed intake in both, late-gestating and early-lactating cows despite a different lipolytic response. Moreover, cows under high ambient temperatures exhibited a metabolic shift towards a pronounced carbohydrate oxidation. To provide a sufficient supply of carbohydrate precursors under hot thermal conditions, these cows extensively degrade tissue protein reflected in the response of plasma urea, creatinine and methyl histidine concentrations. However, the acute metabolic heat response in late-gestating dry cows seems to differ from early-lactating cows as the prepartal adipose tissue is not refractory to lipolytic signals which were present in both stages and the degree of amino acid oxidation may be lower than in the postpartal situation. Both differences might be attributed to nutrient requirements of the fast-growing, near-term fetus and to a higher heat tolerance due to a lower endogenous metabolic heat load in dry cows. It might be useful to consider these divergent demands in the development of nutritional strategies for the attenuation of heat stress impairments of dairy health and performance in the future.']"
2017-09-14T00:00:00Z,Dealing with AFLP genotyping errors to reveal genetic structure in Plukenetia volubilis (Euphorbiaceae) in the Peruvian Amazon,"['The comparison of eight datasets showed that it is better to perform variant multiple data filtering by combining several different approaches. Despite the understandable differences, the “Error” datasets (error-2, error-3, error-4, and error-5), showed more consistent results than “RawGeno” datasets (rep-100, rep-150, all-100, and all-150). The estimation of clusters was independent of reproducibility of the underlying dataset. The exception was hierarchical analysis in STRUCTURE where, thanks to the gradual reduction in the number of individuals and markers, the background noise was predominant over the structural signal in datasets with higher error rates. However, noticeable differences were found in the genetic diversity estimation between datasets. Data quality considerably influenced estimates of genetic diversity, which is a concern for conservation genetics.P. volubilis represents a traditional Peruvian oil crop for human nutrition. Recently, a growing interest in this crop has been noted within the food and pharmaceutical industry. Breeding of sacha inchi allows for improvements in the required characteristics, but for the successful creation of varieties it is necessary to learn about its genetic diversity and variability. Our study showed that, due to long-term phenotypic selection and low gene flow, P. volubilis exists as very isolated subpopulations corresponding with the sampling localities. The degree of differentiation between the subpopulations is probably due more to socio-economic connectivity among the sites than to biological connection, because seeds are transported over different distances. Using the AFLP technique and appropriate filtering data and estimation of error rate can be successfully applied for genetic structure estimation. For the first stage of the breeding process, it would be interesting to create a collection of samples originating from neighboring localities. However, questions remain regarding the degree of variability within loci affected by selection for the desired phenotype. Answers could be provided by association studies aiming to identify these loci.']"
2017-03-28T00:00:00Z,In vitro skin models to study epithelial regeneration from the hair follicle,"['Skin models are useful tools to study various aspects of skin biology, physiology, renewal, wound repair and regeneration and skin diseases. However, it should be noted that they do not mimic every element of native skin nor do they replace all of its functions. These models are deprived of essential communication with the rest of the body including neuroendocrine communications that play an integral role as central regulators of body homeostasis [44, 45]. They also lack functional immune system and regulation and, blood flow important for cellular nutrition and metabolism [46]. The development of an ideal, fully functional skin model has therefore not been attained yet. However, over the years, ongoing research into the cellular and molecular mechanisms which govern the various processes during skin development, repair, renewal and regeneration has led to major advancements in the construction of these skin models that more closely resemble native skin by the incorporation of a variety of cell types including neuronal cells [47], immune cells, melanocytes, endothelial cells, and hair follicle-like structures [48, 49].In this study, we have established an in vitro skin model that mimics the conditions in vivo to study epithelial/mesenchymal interactions and epithelial regeneration from hair follicles. Both DEs supported the initial maintenance of implanted hair follicles, in particular PSU. These follicles provided progenitor epithelial cells that generated epidermis only in DED skin equivalents similar to in vivo. The skin equivalents implanted with PSU were our model of choice. A superior morphology was associated with DED skin equivalent implanted with PSU in vitro. Based on our in vitro and in vivo studies, we conclude that micrografting of PSU into tissue engineered skin may highlight an alternative method to skin grafting of full-thickness wounds. This could be the way forward for the treatment of wounds, potentially saving time and split-skin donor sites.']"
2013-10-08T00:00:00Z,"Obesity and Association with Area of Residence, Gender and Socio-Economic Factors in Algerian and Tunisian Adults","['The aim of the present study was to compare Algeria and Tunisia regarding the prevalence of obesity and its associated socio-economic factors, in the context of the large-scale trends of globalization, modernization and societal changes that both countries are currently experiencing [1]. The nutrition transition appears more advanced in Tunisia: while both countries showed a high prevalence of overweight and obesity (especially among women), the overall burden of overweight and obesity was somewhat higher in Tunisia. As well, in Algeria there was to some extent a double burden of malnutrition [52] at the national level, because thinness was persistent among men. We showed a similar high gender obesity gap in both countries, as women were much more corpulent than men. This was likely due to the similar socio-cultural gender-related issues common to countries in the region, although differences exist between the two countries in the relationship between marital status and obesity. We also highlighted country-specific environmental and socio-economic patterning of corpulence by showing that the relationship with area of residence (urban/rural) and household welfare was much more marked in Tunisia. Nevertheless in both countries even among the poorest households, a fifth of the women were obese. Taking into account the developmental origins of obesity, this could foreshadow an even higher burden of obesity among the poorest in the subsequent generations, in turn fuelling even larger inequalities in health [3]. The observed similarities and differences should be taken into consideration for managing the heavy burden of overweight, obesity and related NCDs in the two countries. Prevention of obesity, especially among women, is a major public health issue in both Tunisia and Algeria, though with country-specific issues regarding the management of obesity inequalities (here associated with area of residence or socio-economic position) that should be taken into account when devising national obesity policies [53].']"
2015-09-02T00:00:00Z,A Single Dynamic Metabolic Model Can Describe mAb Producing CHO Cell Batch and Fed-Batch Cultures on Different Culture Media,"['In this work, we have further developed, accounting for the regulation of glycolysis, and adapted a kinetic metabolic model previously described for other CHO cell lines. The model was challenged with experimental data from two different culture media used in batch and fed-batch cultures. In such model, the initial conditions and the feed composition are the only inputs required to perform culture simulations. A single set of kinetic parameter values allowed describing CHO cell nutritional and metabolic behaviours under batch and fed-batch cultures using two different culture media (Biogro-CHO and PowerCHO-2). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time a metabolic model that includes such a wide array of intracellular concentrations is used to compare culture media and fed-batch strategies for CHO cells. Given its flexible dynamic structure, while the model is cell line-specific, our results suggest that it is not culture medium-specific. In addition to the concentration profiles, given the dynamic nature of the model, we performed a dynamic metabolic flux analysis from model simulation that was in agreement with literature. Model simulations suggest that the cell line used in this study (CHO-DXB11) has a robust metabolism, showing little changes in terms of flux distribution throughout nearly all of the exponential and plateau phase. That metabolism was maintained regardless the medium or the culture mode for most of the culture duration. The fed-batch mode showed stabilizing cell metabolism for an extended period of time. However, sustained amino acids metabolism in fed-batch cultures led to important ammonia accumulation, which may have limited growth while resulting, however, in higher mAb production. We thus believe such model can be further used as an in silico platform and challenged for the identification of optimized medium composition and fed-batch culture strategies, guiding and accelerating bioprocess development steps.']"
2016-09-19T00:00:00Z,Linkage between Fitness of Yeast Cells and Adenylate Kinase Catalysis,"['Here we report an approach that enables in vivo analysis of effects of perturbations of adenylate kinase catalytic parameters in yeast cells. In the experiments growth rates of cells were quantified in response to Adkeco variants with mutations that “cleanly” perturb the targeted parameters (kcat and KMATP) without compromising the enzyme’s structural integrity or thermal stability. First we showed that cytosolic Adk is required for yeast viability in our strain background, and that a catalytically dead but properly folded variant (K13Q) could not restore viability. These results supports that the relative fitness of the yeast strains is depending on the level of Adk activity. The intracellular ATP concentrations in yeast cells are in the low millimolar range [37–39]. The Michaelis constant is related to the dissociation constant (Kd) for a given substrate, and it has been shown that the Kd of ATP binding to Adkeco is 50 μM [40] which is close to the value of KMATP determined here (~70 μM). With KMATP values used as a proxy for ATP binding affinity it is, in fact, expected that all Adk variants used in this study should be saturated with ATP inside yeast cells since the KMATP values ranging from 34 to 417 μM are below the expected cellular ATP levels. This inference was corroborated with the cell growth experiments since no correlation between relative fitness and KMATP values was observed (Fig 8B). Thus, from a standpoint of KMATP, the Adk variants are all fully functional in the cellular milieu and the growth defects observed in the experiments can be attributed to variations in kcat (determined at 20°C). It was found that yeast cell growth at the optimal temperature (30°C) was not affected by the mutations (except for Adkeco0.0002 with a kcat of 0.06 s-1 that was unable to rescue the inviable phenotype), which is remarkable as the kcat of one of the mutants is only 0.4% compared to wild-type Adk1yeast. In contrast, in response to external stress by growth at a sub-optimal temperature of 20°C the relative fitness of yeast was impaired when the kcat value was less than 7% of the Adk1yeast value. Taken together the data show that the kcat value of Adk1yeast is well above the threshold value required for cell growth under optimal and sub-optimal conditions and that there is substantial overcapacity in the catalytic turn over by Adk in yeast cells. A similar functional dependency of relative fitness with a massive catalytic overcapacity has been observed in E. coli for the enzyme β-galactosidase [15, 41]. Thus, both the present study in a eukaryotic organism and the cited β-galactosidase studies in a prokaryotic organism indicate that only a fraction of evolved enzymatic activity may be required for optimal cell growth under laboratory conditions. The data presented here show that, at least a part of the overcapacity in catalytic power is required for organisms to survive external stress conditions that may apply to organisms in their natural habitats. There exist other ways of inflicting stress conditions to yeast in laboratory growth experiments and examples thereof are; oxidative stress, and nutritional stress. For the conceptual discovery here temperature was chosen since it is a parameter that can be accurately controlled and no additional variables such as nutritional uptake or intracellular concentrations (of for instance hydrogen peroxide in oxidative stress experiments) needs to be considered. Additionally, the plasmid shuffling system developed here is a useful platform in order to promote novel discoveries in Adk enzymology. This can in principle be performed by searching for intragenic suppressor mutations that can revert/save an inviable phenotype dependant on mutation of key catalytic residues. Intragenic suppressor mutations may bypass the effect of the mutation leading to inviability and this bypass effect can generate novel information on, for instance, the plasticity of active sites. A second application to the method lies within enzyme design, here it is possible to make use of the fact that yeast can survive with a very low kcat value at 30°C (Fig 7). One useful experiment that contains significant information on design would be to evolve adenylate kinase activity from an unrelated ATP binding enzyme. Random mutation of the gene encoding this scaffold enzyme followed by transformation into the yeast plasmid shuffling system would generate viable colonies only if adenylate kinase activity has evolved.']"
2016-03-09T00:00:00Z,“When Treatment Is More Challenging than the Disease”: A Qualitative Study of MDR-TB Patient Retention,"['We believe this study has important implications for service delivery in MDR-TB. First, accurate treatment education and counseling provided in a non-judgmental manner, that involves family members and garners their support from the outset, is likely to enhance patients’ commitment to treatment and reduce attrition. It is particularly imperative that we introduce these practices preemptively, before the onset of adverse drug effects, so patients and their family members are armed with correct knowledge before they become naturally inclined to discontinue treatment at the first sign of symptom improvement (or the lack thereof). It is also important that counseling be administered through the full course of treatment, as patients’ circumstances and experiences with medications are likely to change over the 1.5–2 years. Second, in relation to the above point, peer support groups may be effective ways to deliver emotional support and enhance treatment literacy, given that MDR-TB patients in India may lack access to emotional support and empathy within their own homes. The impact of social support and peer groups on LFU may be subsequently studied more objectively. Third, financial support by way of conditional grants or monetary incentives should be explored to encourage long-term retention in MDR-TB care, given patients’ dire socioeconomic circumstances and the public health imperative to reduce transmission of drug-resistant strains within the larger community. Nutrition and transport reimbursements have been associated with lower rates of non-adherence [27]. Fourth, there appears to be poor co-ordination and referral between primary health care level workers and Program staff, which may compound the difficulties patients already experience as they navigate the health system. This may be remediated through staff training, capacity building, and expanding communication channels between field DOT providers and district supervisors. Lastly, strengthening public-private partnerships, and communication with traditional healers, is a necessary component of TB service delivery in India given the high rate of medical pluralism.']"
2019-08-29T00:00:00Z,The Pacific harbor seal gut microbiota in Mexico: Its relationship with diet and functional inferences,"['In this study, we describe the gut microbiota function and composition of wild colonies of harbor seals in Baja California. Contrary to our expectations, higher variability in the diet found in harbor seal colonies in close proximity to each other was not reflected in differences in the gut microbiota structure. We observed variation in the diversity and richness among the northern (PBE and TS) and the southern (N-TS) harbor seal colonies. The coastal harbor seal colony studied in the present research showed a higher level of gut microorganisms diversity and richness which could be explained by the acquisition of environmental bacteria due to the individuals’ proximity to the land and the higher number of prey consumed. Future research on the gut microbiota should be focused on the apparently vulnerable PBE colony in order to understand the impact of human disturbance on the composition of the gut microbiota and its probable effect on the seals’ health.As in previous studies of the mammalian gut microbiome, our study also found correlations between diet and microbial composition. A high polyunsaturated lipid content in the prey consumed by harbor seals may be a major factor shaping the gut microbiota community and its function. Information on the nutritional values of the prey and the harbor seals’ nutrient requirements may provide insight into its prey preferences. Moreover, further metagenomic approaches would allow an understanding of the dynamic nature of the gut microbial community, and its metabolic capabilities, and role in the harbor seal’s feeding habit.Our study represents a first insight into the factors that shape the gut microbiota of wild harbor seals, such as environmental conditions and the prey consumed. Harbor seals are non-migratory animals that forage near their colonies, due to which behavior, changes in the gut microbial composition can be attributed to changes in the location of their colonies, giving an idea of the relationship between the health status of the harbor seal and its surrounding environment. This information could not only be used to position the harbor seal as an environmental sentinel species for the Baja California coast and its islands, but may also contribute to the conservation of the subspecies.']"
2015-08-26T00:00:00Z,The Effect of Climate Variability on Gray Whales (Eschrichtius robustus) within Their Wintering Areas,"['The evidence suggest that the numbers of MC pairs at OLL are a reflection of the changes in the total number of calves born in the whole population, and these changes in calves’ numbers can be attributed to changes in nutritive condition of females due to temporal changes in the length of the open-water season at their feeding areas, with higher number of calves born after an extended ice-free season, and lower number of calves born after a shorter ice-free season. Our results agree with similar findings by other researchers about polar climate effects on gray whale abundance at their wintering areas. This may be useful for predicting numbers of MC pairs at OLL during the coming season using the sea ice conditions of the previous feeding season (http://pafc.arh.noaa.gov/ice.php).ENSO-related variability in water temperature also influences the wintering distribution of gray whale MC pairs, especially in the southern extreme of their distribution during strong ENSO events, like the 1998 El Niño and 1999 La Niña. This evidence supports the hypothesis that gray whales prefer more southerly areas during years with cold sea temperature (La Niña) and more northerly areas during warmer sea temperatures (El Niño) to reduce thermal-stress and optimize energy utilization for newborn calves and their mothers. This shift in MC pairs could be anticipated with ENSO forecasts (http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/), and it could be useful to predict the numbers of MC pairs at SDCh, an area with intense tourism activity dedicated to whale watching.Indeed, such predictions could be incorporated into the marine ecological program management that is currently being prepared by the Mexican government and the scientific community (http://www.semarnat.gob.mx/temas/ordenamientoecologico/bitacora/Paginas/pacifico_norte.aspx). Moreover, traits of gray whale ecology could be used to track biological consequences of climatic variation in a specific region and time frame under specific ecological conditions.']"
2014-04-01T00:00:00Z,Effects of Salinity and Nutrient Addition on Mangrove Excoecaria agallocha,"['E. agallocha is highly sensitive to salinity, especially at early developmental stages. The favorable salinity range for seed germination is below 5 psu, and salinity of 15 psu decreased seedling establishment rate to 37%, which partly explained why few seedlings can be found in the mangrove reserve which has soil salinity slightly higher than 15 psu. The adverse saline condition in the field might act as a primary obstacle for natural regeneration of this species. Thus, artificial breeding and culture should be adopted to ensure higher survival rate of E. agallocha seedlings.Then when to replant this species in the field? Results from the present study indicate that seedlings as young as one-month old can hardly tolerant salinity above 15 psu, while for two-year old seedlings, they can adapt to salinity up to 15 psu although failing to surviving 25 psu salinity in the long run, which indicates that E. agallocha increased salinity tolerance over time and two-year old seedlings could be chosen for E. agallocha restoration in sites where soil salinity is up to 15 psu. In addition to salinity, nutritional limitation prevailing in mangrove forests is another challenge for successful reforestation. The current study shows that nutrient addition could not only greatly enhance plant growth, but also alleviate salt-induced damage to plant physiology. Therefore, applying nutrient rationally could be very helpful in promoting survival of E. agallocha seedlings in plantations with relatively high salinity.On the other hand, we should be aware that due to the particularity of their natural habitat, field restoration of mangrove forests is confronted with many other challenges. Duration and frequency of seawater inundation, predation by crabs and gastropods, soil physiochemical properties, inter- and intra-species competition, and anthropogenic disturbance might be equally important in determining whether E. agallocha seedlings would sustainably develop in nature. And researches on these environmental factors as well as various other mangrove species are under way in order for the prosperity of mangrove ecosystems.']"
2016-01-27T00:00:00Z,"An Ecological Paradox: The African Wild Dog (Lycaon Pictus) Is Not Attracted to Water Points When Water Is Scarce in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe","['Our results indicate that availability of surface water influences the habitat preferences of the African wild dog in two opposing ways. Firstly, as expected and in tandem with the ‘resource gradient hypothesis’ there is evidence of attraction between surface water and wild dog distribution during wet years. The mechanism of the attraction could be that wild dog prey (e.g., impala) aggregate around water points and wild dogs follow prey herds for their nutrition. Secondly, in complete disagreement with the ‘resource gradient hypothesis’, there is evidence that wild dogs are not attracted to water points when water points are few. This paradox may be explained by the intraguild predation and kleptoparasitism concept. During prolonged dry period (droughts), some water points dry up, consequently there is more concentration of prey around the remaining water points. This concentration of prey also attracts apex predators (e.g., lion and hyena) which outcompete wild dogs for kills and possibly prey on wild dogs. As such wild dogs are driven away from near the water points to peripheral areas free from competition for kills and danger of predators. We recognize that other variables (e.g., human interference, interaction with other wild dog packs and densities of prey) are likely also to be important in governing wild dog habitat preference. As such, future studies should assess variables including kleptoparasitism and density of other predators and analyze these against wild dog habitat preference. Explicit investigation of the mechanisms linking availability of water and local habitat-wild dog associations will also be an important direction for future research. Nevertheless, our research advances current understanding of the linkages between wet and drought periods to wild dog home ranges, illustrating that water availability does not have a straight forward relationship with canids’ distribution. For example, dwindling water points may indirectly cause wild dogs to range wider, consequently encroaching into human settlements, which may lead to increased conflict with humans and exacerbated stress on this already endangered species.']"
2017-12-15T00:00:00Z,"Nutrients resorption and stoichiometry characteristics of different-aged plantations of Larix kaempferi in the Qinling Mountains, central China","['The present study suggests the nutrient concentrations of C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, and Al in the green and senesced leaves do not change with the plantation age of L. kaempferi in the Qinling Mountains. Most nutrients, except for Fe, in these L. kaempferi are either relatively lower than or close to the physiological concentrations required, thus suggesting a relative limitation of multiple nutrients for L. kaempferi growth. Much higher concentrations of nutrients in the leaves of the 15-yr old plantation could be attributed to the relatively higher content of available nutrients in that plantation’s soil. The low N:P ratio for this species further suggests that the plantation growth of L. kaempferi was mainly limited by N nutrient. Thus, nitrogen fertilizer should be added in a timely way to meet the nutritional needs for L. kaempferi. The nutrient resorption efficiency (RE) of N, P, K and Mg revealed resorption activity, while mineral nutrients Ca and Fe tended to accumulate in senesced leaves. The absence of a single resorption pattern for Ca, Fe or Al, however, in four different aged L. kaempferi plantations indicates that these processes of nutrient resorption are quite complicated, and it is unlikely that one factor governs the nutrient resorption patterns alone. Overall, the nutrient REs of all the measured elements do not change with plantation age, though they were positively related to their respective concentrations in the green leaves of L. kaempferi. Based on the RE of Al, we conjecture that Al detoxification did not occur in L. kaempferi under the present study conditions, even though Al toxicity is common in certain acidic soils. Nevertheless, L. kaempferi leaves that have a higher C:N ratio and lower N concentration will ultimately bring about decrease of rates of leaf litter decomposition. This may have a negative influence on the nutrient turnover and cycling, as well as the soil fertility and primary productivity, of plantation forest ecosystems in the Qinling Mountains. Appropriate human interventions, such as applying nitrogen fertilizer to the present plantations or establishing mixted forest types of coniferous and broad-leaved forest, should be pursued to ensure a balance of ecological and economic benefits as provided by the L. kaempferi plantation forest ecosystem into the future.']"
2015-10-14T00:00:00Z,Dietitians and Nutritionists: Stigma in the Context of Obesity. A Systematic Review,"['So far, there seems to be a lack of sufficient evidence for reasonable approaches to reduce explicit as well as implicit negative attitudes towards obesity and overweight in society. To investigate if and why assumptions about causes of obesity and overweight might arise or change, could be the key to prevent weight-related stigma by dietitians and improve the health care condition for those that are stigmatized due to weight. It might be difficult to change society’s way of thinking about people with overweight or obesity but it could be a first step to start with the occupational group whose responsibility it is to treat them with understanding and respect in order to help them reduce any health risk that is related to their body weight. One way could be to include the issue of weight stigmatization (and its consequences for those affected) as part of the academic syllabus for students being educated in dietetics and nutrition as well as other related working areas. Intervention programs should not only focus on theory and scientific knowledge, but also call attention for discrimination and stereotyping. It might make them more sensible for this issue and therefore lower or efface their negative attitudes towards people with overweight or obesity. In addition to that it might help them prepare their patients in order to deal with weight bias in everyday life situations. Students as well as professionals should be made aware that mistreatment in terms of handling clients or patients as well as misunderstanding in regard of the aetiology of obesity can have negative effects on a physical or mental health level. Although there is mixed evidence whether intervention programs that aim to clarify the aetiology of obesity are helpful in reducing stigma, this component will need to be investigated more thoroughly in the future.Weight stigmatization could negatively affect treatment outcomes or keep the patient from seeking medical advice. Patient-centered care does not only include functional skills and theoretical expertise- it is also about interaction and communication, motivation and patience, and probably most of all compassion and kindness.']"
2014-07-01T00:00:00Z,De Novo Transcriptomes of a Mixotrophic and a Heterotrophic Ciliate from Marine Plankton,"['We used RNAseq to characterize the transcriptomes of two non-model microbial eukaryotes. This approach provided information about genes with known functions as well as multiple potentially novel genes. We experienced the typical challenges of studying non-model organisms and using automatic annotation tools that do not detect the whole spectrum of protist physiological features. Limitations such as unknown levels of genome coverage, high proportion of sequences not similar to those available in databases, and annotations not compatible with protist biology have been common in this kind of study so far. Additional effort was required for sequencing and filtering food transcripts, given that the ciliates under study cannot be cultured independent of their prey.The transcriptomes of Strombidium rassoulzadegani and Strombidinopsis sp. provide baselines for analyzing ciliate metabolism, ecological roles in the planktonic food web and relationships with the environment. Our observations are noteworthy in two ways. First, we analyzed the first transcriptomes from oligotrichs and choreotrichs, which are the most diverse and abundant ciliates in marine plankton. Second, the species we chose practice two contrasting nutritional modes, heterotrophy and mixotrophy, and hence have somewhat different ecological roles. Although the transcriptomes differed in general features such as GC content distribution and had a homology lower than 50%, they provided similar annotations for GO terms and KEGG pathways, which were related mostly to housekeeping activity. As more ciliate reference genomes become available, we expect that more pathways, including novel ones, will be revealed in the data.Transcriptome information alone provided limited insights on genes related to mixotrophy. We did not find transcripts clearly related to the maintenance and functioning of retained chloroplasts in S. rassoulzadegani and we identified very similar antioxidant mechanisms in both mixotrophic and heterotrophic ciliates. The relevance of one enzyme potentially related to ascorbate recycling in the mixotroph as well as the potential differences in regulation and expression levels of all the identified genes require future experimentation in order to understand the implications of antioxidant pathways for physiology and evolution of mixotrophs.']"
2014-10-20T00:00:00Z,Neurobiological Correlates in Forensic Assessment: A Systematic Review,"['The influence genes and deviances in brain development have on the development of violent aggressive behaviour, and in which situation, needs further research before genetic and brain imaging information can be used in forensic assessments or in court. [11], [20], [76] Though most mechanisms are not elucidated, some of the findings may in time be used to estimate risk of recidivism in combination with psychosocial assessment tools. This means better tools for neurologically based assessment might become available as the knowledge develops.As the developmental profile of brain areas and their vulnerabilities are being discovered, key moments to modulate specific environmental factors for persons with a high-risk genetic profile will become possible. [114] For example, some findings can be used to more accurately assess risk of criminal behaviour on an individual basis. However, there is an important ethical difference between using neurobiological assessment tools in the case of suspects and convicted offenders versus in the general population or subgroups, such as children or adolescents. Even in case of the former group, offender rights might be at stake [65].On a more general level, knowledge of nutrition could be used to improve our society or correctional facilities, and help prevent future encounters with forensic facilities. Better guidance during the most difficult years of adolescence and home visits can diminish chances of a harmful overload of the prefrontal cortex and decrease chances of child abuse. And obviously, brain damage should be avoided. Reducing those criminogenic risk factors reduces the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity, both directly and via reduced triggering of gene-environment interactions. [103] In the future, new information from neuroscience, when integrated into the information already available from sociological and psychological assessments, could contribute to the development of better risk assessment tools, treatments and cures for offenders, reducing recidivism as well [16], [21], [63], [66].This review underlines the importance of maintaining a case-by-case differentiated approach to evidence-based forensic assessment that takes into account the individual psychosocial development, and neurobiological and genetic risk factors contributing to violent crime.']"
2014-01-29T00:00:00Z,Juvenile Hormone Biosynthesis Gene Expression in the corpora allata of Honey Bee (Apis mellifera L.) Female Castes,"['We annotated 25 genes of the JH biosynthetic pathway in the honey bee genome and assayed the expression levels of 24, showing that several of these are prominently expressed in CA-CC complexes, when compared to other tissues. Six genes comprising representatives of the mevalonate pathway, as well as of the JH-specific steps were selected for transcript abundance measurements in two contrasting situations of the honey bee life cycle, the fourth larval instar with its caste-specific differences in the JH titer, and in adult workers, which show task-related JH titer differences. This revealed that the transcriptional regulation of a methyl farnesoate epoxidase-encoding gene (mfe) involved in JH biosynthesis in the CA, and of a JH esterase encoding gene (jhe) involved in JH degradation, should be key events for the control of JH levels in the hemolymph. Interestingly, these genes appear to be regulated in a different fashion in the fourth larval instar, when compared to adult workers. Whereas in the fourth larval instar the JH titer was closely correlated with jhe transcript levels, in the adults this was the case for mfe. For adult workers we could furthermore show that mfe expression is also contingent on the nutritional status. This, together with the finding that jhe transcript levels were reduced in workers that had their mfe gene function diminished by RNAi, makes a case for the caste- and stage-specific complexity in the regulation of the hemolymph JH titer in honey bees. Probably this is what is expected of a pleiotropic hormone, and this could also be the center court for the evolvability of its functions in the diversity and plasticity of insect life cycles.The molecular pathway differences underlying JH titer regulation in honey bee caste development versus age-related division of labor may reflect differences in selection pressures on key enzymes during the evolution of sociality. This may not only be reflected in the expansion of the fpps genes in the honey bee, as well in synonymous versus non-synonymous changes in the sequences of other genes involved in JH biosynthesis and metabolism. Both aspects could now be investigated by comparing these genes across bee genomes currently under study. In particular studies intending to investigate the co-option and changing roles of JH in social insects under a phylogenetic hypothesis should consider measuring the transcript levels of mfe and jhe orthologs in addition to the respective JH hemolymph titers.']"
2019-02-13T00:00:00Z,Prenatal maternal docosahexaenoic acid intake and infant information processing at 4.5mo and 9mo: A longitudinal study,"['Putting together the findings from all of the tasks in this study, and considering them in relation to the inconsistent pattern of findings from previous research, it is impossible to conclude, with any reasonable degree of certainty, whether or not higher intake of DHA (either maternally during pregnancy or breastfeeding, or via infant postnatal levels) promotes better infant cognitive development. This view is supported by the most recent Cochrane reviews[43,44] reporting that, on balance, the current published empirical evidence does not support the theory of higher DHA levels resulting in better infant cognitive development (in infants born at term). Despite the number of positive studies reporting such a link, routine maternal supplementation and/or addition of DHA to infant formula should not be recommended at this time based on purported cognitive outcomes.We also note that even in the case of visual acuity the effect we report is only apparent at 9 months post-partum, not at 4.5 months, when it may be expected that any differences between individuals may be more apparent. It is important to be aware that this may be a common feature in studies examining the impact of nutritional factors on development; namely, that the findings appear to be transient. However, this does not necessarily mean that they are any less important. Significant transient effects may well have consequences throughout the developmental course that are not initially apparent. Furthermore, transient findings support the rationale of considering examination of nutrient levels at more than one time point during pregnancy. Specific nutrients appear to have a critical point of action on the developing brain, likely related to the specific development within a particular cognitive system occurring at the time.Finally, we feel it is with caution that findings of studies such as this are translated into advice for pregnant women regarding their diet and supplement choices. At the moment there appears to be no conclusive, unequivocal evidence to support the recommendation that pregnant women increase DHA levels for the purpose of optimising postnatal cognitive development in their infant. This is not to say that there may not be other, evidence based, reasons to do this (for example, in relation to allergy development; or for maternal cardiovascular health), however, in the case of cognitive or visual development10, the empirical support for higher prenatal intake is still lacking.']"
2019-07-18T00:00:00Z,Effect of the black chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa (Michx.) Elliott) juice acquisition method on the content of polyphenols and antioxidant activity,"['The study shows that pressing efficiency depends on the design of the press and the type of pretreatment. The highest pressing efficiency was obtained using the twin gear juice extractor. For juice obtained by pressing whole fruits using the piston press, the application of pretreatment consisting of fruit freezing and thawing had a significant effect on the pressing efficiency. Enzymatic liquefaction of shredded fruits significantly increased the efficiency of pressing using the piston press. The type of press and the kind of preliminary treatment had an effect on the quality traits of the acquired juices. The highest content of soluble solids was obtained for the pressing of fruits not subjected to any pretreatment using the twin gear press. The application of enzymatic treatment or pretreatment consisting of fruit freezing and thawing prior to pressing caused a decrease in the content of soluble solids in the juice. Irrespective of the method of obtaining juice and the applied treatment, differences in the acidity of the extracted juices were small. The study revealed a distinct effect of the method of juice acquisition on TPC and AA. The highest TPC was obtained in juice extracted using the piston press from shredded fruits subjected to enzymatic treatment at 45°C. A higher TPC was also noted in juice from fruits not subjected to any pretreatment and extracted with the twin gear press. The lowest TPC was found in juice from fruits subjected to pretreatment consisting of fruit freezing and thawing prior to pressing. The capacity of black chokeberry juices for free radical quenching oscillated around the level of approximately 90%. It should also be noted that the methods of juice processing had a little effect on the AA of the juices.The study showed that the application of suitable processing methods is necessary for the acquisition of a product with desirable quality traits. To satisfy consumer expectations, one should search for such fruit processing technologies through which the presence of biologically active substances in the products will enhance their nutritive value. Taking into account the documented health-promoting effect of components contained in black chokeberry juice, it can be concluded that after the application of appropriate processing methods, the raw material has potential for use in the production of health-promoting foods.']"
2017-03-31T00:00:00Z,Bacteriophage preparation lytic for Shigella significantly reduces Shigella sonnei contamination in various foods,"['Our studies continue to support the idea that lytic bacteriophages can be used to effectively reduce the levels of various foodborne bacteria in various foods, thus rendering those foods safer for human consumption. Although major foodborne outbreaks of Shigella infections are relatively rare in the United States, Shigella spp. do cause ca. 500,000 cases of illness in the USA annually [3,4,25]. The problem of shigellosis was recently highlighted by an outbreak in Flint, Michigan during September—October 2016, where the population was afraid to use water for handwashing due to the concerns of the water being contaminated with lead [26]. Although the role of contaminated foods in the outbreak has not been firmly established, it is likely that they played at least some—and possibly major—role in spreading the disease. Another, more direct example of foodborne shigellosis outbreak is the 406-person antibiotic resistant S. sonnei outbreak in 2000, which was linked to ready to eat dip [27]. ShigaShield™ and similar phage preparations lytic for Shigella may help reduce the incidence or severity of such outbreaks. Another important area of potential application is the use of phages to improve the safety of foods for the US military and/or travelers; e.g., for treating fresh fruits and vegetables in high risk Shigella locations overseas, where US troops are stationed but where the local sanitation standards and/or quality of water are not optimal, thus creating an increased risk of Shigella contamination.The use of phage preparations for food safety applications has been gradually gaining traction in the United States, where several phage preparations targeting major foodborne pathogens like L. monocytogenes, E. coli O157:H7, and Salmonella are currently on the market. These preparations offer safe and effective intervention modalities for removing their targeted bacteria from various foods, without altering organoleptic qualities of those foods and their normal microflora / nutritional characteristics [16]. After ShigaShield™ becomes commercially available, it will be another addition to that growing family of all natural lytic phage preparations that can serve as an important additional tool for reducing the levels of Shigella in our foods and making them safer to eat.']"
2017-04-17T00:00:00Z,The coexistence of traditional medicine and biomedicine: A study with local health experts in two Brazilian regions,"['In this study we highlight the contrasts and similarities in two different regions of Brazil and we found that access to biomedicine does not necessarily displace traditional medicine, but that these two systems can coexist in a complementary and complex way. However, there are different situations in the coexistence of these two systems. In the Araripe region, we observed a strong maintenance of health practices, reflecting historical, cultural and environmental particularities. The distance to urban centers, the size of the communities and the networks between healers and prayers, and the availability of medicinal plants in natural environments are related to such maintenance. In the maroon communities the changes in the traditional health practices are more present, due to modernization, easy access to urban centers and urban jobs, and changes in the local livelihoods. We are assuming that in the past, maroon and Araripe communities depended more in their self reliance for health care, but one of the limitations of this study is that we do not have the precise scenario of the local health practices before the 1970s. In any case, there is a tendency for the two regions of a decrease in the number of healers, demand for healers, and use of medicinal plants, especially among maroons.In addition to the differences in the two regions, knowledge about medicinal plants and the use of medicines was complementary in the two regions, where medicinal plants are principally used to treat simpler diseases, such as digestive and respiratory disease and general pains, and allopathic medicines are principally used for problems with blood pressure, general pain and endocrine and nutritional diseases.Cultivation and harvesting are still the main way of obtaining plants in both regions, and this favors the maintenance of traditional knowledge. Changes in local livelihoods may change the availability and access to plant resources, when people skip from rural activities to urban ones. However, a local cosmovision abouth health in which prayers, healers and medicinal plant specialists are valued can counterbalance these changes, and may vary depending on the socioeconomic context. This study also found that there was knowledge and appreciation for traditional health practices in both regions. It is important to create strategies to train health professionals to work under these complementary conditions of therapy and to respect the different forms of knowledge in order to seek a higher quality of the healthcare for local communities.']"

This approach might be particularly relevant to the management of lung infections in CF patients for the following reasons:\nit might inform future molecular studies on the interaction between microorganisms and the host regarding competition for specific mineral nutrients. Measurement in trace elements might in fact increase the understanding of the pathophysiological processes during pulmonary infection. This is particularly relevant for S. maltophilia, since bacterium-host interactions are not yet fully understood. Specifically, our findings showed that S. maltophilia uses the common strategy of modulating the host ionome, causing significant differences in trace elements balance, probably by direct or indirect mechanisms. The higher impact we observed on cationic homeostasis provoked by the more virulent Sm111 CF strain might be due to its adaption to a compromised environment, i.e. CF lung, and to be associated to an exacerbation of a particular step of pathogenesis.\n\nconsidering the potential association we observed between trace element levels and lung infection/inflammation, combined with their likely higher resistance to protease degradation compared to cytokines, trace elements could be considered as potentially robust markers of lung pathophysiology, thus offering new insight into pulmonary inflammation. Particularly, the observed changes in Mn, Mg, and Se levels in BAL samples seem to be exhaustively predictive for the severity of S. maltophilia lung infection. Therefore, their measurement in sputum might have potential diagnostic and prognostic usefulness.\n\nit might be valuable in defining/designing disease management strategies in CF patients. Control of CF disease includes managing nutritional status, as well as using of therapeutic modulators of CFTR function. Therefore, the observed adverse effect caused by S. maltophilia infection on trace elements status emphasizes the importance of careful monitoring and, if necessary, supplementation of oligoelements during therapy in CF patients concomitantly suffer from infections. This might otherwise jeopardise the outcome of treatment in the patient.\nFurther studies are warranted to confirm that changes in ionomic profile we observed are specifically caused by S. maltophilia, rather than they represent a consequence of infection-induced changes in host metabolism.']"

This covers the cost of medium- and high-complexity procedures involved in treating obesity and diseases attributable to obesity. These costs attributable to obesity corresponded to 1.86% of all Ministry of Health’s expenditure related to hospital and ambulatory care in Brazil (59.2% of the total was hospital admissions and 40.8% corresponded to ambulatory procedures). The costs attributable to obesity in women were double the costs for men and the cost of morbid obesity in women was five times higher than it was in men. The obesity-attributable costs were highest for ischemic heart disease, followed by breast cancer, congestive heart failure and diabetes.When analyzed by severity, the cost of morbid obesity was found to be proportionally higher than the cost of obesity. Despite its low prevalence in the population (0.81%), morbid obesity now accounts for almost a quarter of the costs attributable to obesity in the public health system, totaled $64.2 million in 2011. Bariatric surgery was the single highest cost, accounting for $17.4 million, or 27.1% of costs attributable to morbid obesity.If the current epidemic were not reversed, the prevalence of obesity in Brazil will increase gradually in the coming years, as well as its costs, having serious implications for the financial sustainability of the public health system. With regard to public policies, it is essential to strengthen the actions already started in Brazil for the prevention and control of obesity, such as: a) increasing the supply and availability of healthy foods, including the reduction of prices of fruit and vegetables; b) the promotion of healthy environments to facilitate adequate food choices and physical activity; c) adoption of effective interventions at all points of the health care network in order to ensure the completeness of obesity care in the public health system; d) food and nutrition education, as the publication of the Food Guide for the Brazilian population and its dissemination; e) restriction of unhealthy food marketing, especially for children.Studies of this nature need to be conducted on a regular basis in Brazil in order to monitor the economic impacts of the obesity epidemic in the coming years.']"
2017-11-08T00:00:00Z,Obesity and the burden of health risks among the elderly in Ghana: A population study,"['This paper contributes new knowledge on aging and international health with particular emphasis on elderly obesity and health risks. The paper’s scholarly contribution is four-fold. First, prior studies have focused on the disparate effects of obesity on hypertension, arthritis, functional disability and cognitive impairment, with special emphasis on youth cohorts. This study examines these health risks associated with obesity among the elderly in the context of a developing country. The cultural context of Ghana and the multilevel effects of these health risks make the findings compelling and the policy implications important. Increasing life expectancy and ageing trends call for health policies and planning together to accommodate chronic health conditions for the elderly population. The likely coexistence of elderly obesity with hypertension and other chronic conditions such as arthritis, angina, and diabetes implies attention to chronic conditions among the obese elderly must collectively focus on all possible risk factors.Second, the factors influencing the transition from stage 1 to stage 2 hypertension have rarely been examined in the existing literature. This paper fills that gap by distinguishing between the risk of stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension, the latter being significant for clinical and medical practice. When diagnosed early, the elderly who are stage 1 hypertensive have the chance to make behavioral changes that could avert future medical complications or early mortality due to stage 2 hypertension.Third, this study identifies factors such as physical activity that could potentially mediate the effects of obesity on health risks among the elderly. By doing so, our findings underscore the need for nutritional interventions and other prevention strategies to reduce the health risks associated with obesity. This is particularly important now because urbanization and shifts toward more sedentary lifestyles and diets rich in fat, sugar, and animal-based protein in developing nations increase susceptibility to obesity.Finally, this study points to the need to address the social determinants of health as a critical intervention to ensure the economic and socially disadvantaged in society do not disproportionately carry the burden of these health risks. The multiple health risks associated with obesity among the elderly in Ghana and elsewhere in SSA make it a public health concern that needs to be addressed through the right policies, educational campaigns, and interventions.']"
2016-11-22T00:00:00Z,On the Effects of Artificial Feeding on Bee Colony Dynamics: A Mathematical Model,"['This paper has proposed a new model to simulate the influence of artificial feeding on bee colony population dynamics. This model was based on a well-established framework and introduced new elements that allow for analysis of artificial diets, which had not been done before.A differential equation describing variation in artificial food was included in the formula. The preference of the bees for natural food was modeled using a function T(f), which includes a parameter d associated with the palatability of the artificial diet. A generic function μ(⋅) was adopted to account for the lack of natural food due to environmental conditions. A function z(⋅) was used to model the approaches adopted by the beekeeper to introduce artificial diet in the colony. A parameter β was introduced to quantify the quality of the artificial food.The proposed model was shown to be consistent with the previous model when there is no artificial food and the foragers gather food with maximum efficiency. The model assumes that, when there is abundance of natural food, the artificial diet is neglected by the bees, as it has been observed in practice. Simulations have shown that this assumption was implemented correctly. Simulations have shown also that, by introducing artificial diets during harsh times (when there is severe shortage of natural food), the beekeeper can avoid the hive collapse that would have occurred if the bees were left to fend for themselves.Experimental results, involving four different artificial diets, were analyzed to validate the proposed model. The experimental results were divided in training and test sets. The parameter β was tuned using the results from the training sets. A good match was found between the results obtained with the model and the results observed experimentally in the test sets.Future studies could apply the proposed model to other environmental conditions and compare results with new experimental data. Experiments to determine the value of β for new diets could be conducted in the laboratory (feeding bees with the artificial diet) and validated in the field. Furthermore, studies could be carried out to assess whether the value of β can be estimated based on nutritional parameters of the artificial diet. Finally, the approach proposed here to analyze the effects of artificial food could be integrated into other bee colony population models.']"
2014-05-05T00:00:00Z,"Phytochemical Composition, Antioxidant Activity and HPLC Fingerprinting Profiles of Three Pyrola Species from Different Regions","['The results from the present study indicated that all tested Pyrola samples significantly differed from each other in their phytochemical profiles and antioxidant property. Through comprehensive analysis and evaluation, P. calliantha was selected as the most valuable species, and the P. calliantha sample from Left banner of Alxa even possessed the strongest antioxidant activity among all the thirteen samples. Futhermore, Emei Mountain was proved to be the most suitable region for producing P. decorata. The results indicated that there were rich variations in Pyrola samples.Different chemical compositions may lead to significant differences in effectiveness as functional foods and nutritional supplements. In order to further evaluate the diversities and quality of Pyrola, HPLC fingerprint analysis coupled with HCA and DA were introduced to establish a simple, rapid and effective method for the accurate identification, classification and quality assessment of Pyrola. Thirteen samples were separated into three groups using HCA at a rescaled distance of 12.5, this separation being consistent with the results of morphological classification. Furthermore, the thirteen samples were separated into six groups at a rescaled distance of 5, which can be identified as the same species of Pyrola from different regions of origin. Two types of discriminant functions were generated using three selected predictor variables and the ratio of discrimination was 100%. In summary, this method can identify different species of Pyrola and the same species from different regions of origin.The present study provides meaningful information for the collection and application of Pyrola in both healthcare and the food industry. Moreover, the results from this study could be used to compare and control the quality of Pyrola and other natural products prepared from them. It is well known that the species of Pyrola are very abundant; in this research we only studied three of them, so a large, systematic study of Pyrola from different sources is required in a future study. Additionally, it is understood that the DPPH scavenging capacity assay, ABTS•+ radical cation scavenging assay and ferric reducing power (FRAP) assay used in the present study may not fully reflect the antioxidative mechanisms of Pyrola in vivo and its health promotion properties in the human body, and further cellular and in vivo studies of the biological activities are required.']"
2013-12-23T00:00:00Z,Relationship between the Relative Limitation and Resorption Efficiency of Nitrogen vs Phosphorus in Woody Plants,"['Using a global dataset for N and P in both green and senesced leaves, we explored patterns and mechanisms in the responses of NRE vs PRE across woody plants with contrasting leaf habits. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation that shows a clear and global-scale negative relationships between the relative nutrient limitation (based on foliar N:P ratio) and the difference in nutrient resorption efficiency of N vs P (indicated by NRE minus PRE) across woody species, growth-forms, and vegetation-types. This relationship supports a relative resorption hypothesis that plants resorb proportionately more of the relatively more limiting nutrient. The relative resorption hypothesis suggests another potential way to determine the critical (optimal) N:P ratio (when NRE ≈ PRE) in a given plant community/vegetation. Moreover, according to the hypothesis, communities with higher/lower foliar N:P (more likely P/N limited) tend to produce litter with disproportionately higher/lower N:P, causing a worsening status of P/N availability; this positive feedback may however be counteracted by several negative-feedback mechanisms.P generally shows higher variability in resorption efficiency, and higher resorption sensitivity to nutrient availability, compared to N, suggesting that the resorption of P seems more important for plant nutrient conservation and N:P stoichiometry. Deciduous plants have lower PRE than NRE while evergreens, conifers, and N-fixers have higher PRE than NRE, consistent with predictions of the relative resorption hypothesis. Evergreens show lower response of (NRE-PRE) to nutrient status, compared to deciduous plants and conifers, which is possibly related to their relatively long growing seasons and thus the relatively stable rate of nutrient re-translocation in EB.This study indicates that foliar N:P ratio, together with (NRE-PRE), can provide a useful tool for the assessment of plant N vs P nutritional status and improve our understandings of the underlying mechanism of nutrient resorption. This should be helpful in predicting how variations in plant nutrient availability induced by global change will influence the nutrient resorption process in different plant groups and alter global nutrient cycling.']"
2008-04-22T00:00:00Z,What Are the Implications for Childhood Pneumonia of Successfully Introducing Hib and Pneumococcal Vaccines in Developing Countries?,"[""It may seem rash even to contemplate the decline of S. pneumoniae, which has evolved as a varied, adaptable, and enduring human parasite. However, the operational success of PCV immunization in America does prompt this very consideration. If the initiative of the GAVI Alliance to introduce effective vaccines against Hib and pneumococcus throughout the developing world succeeds in reducing these diseases significantly, our present approach to the management of pneumonia will abruptly become irrelevant.To prepare against this possibility, we need to re-examine thoroughly the broad clinical problem that is currently labeled “pneumonia”; that is, (i) to define and measure the causes of this collection of respiratory diseases; (ii) to determine the clinical, radiological, and laboratory features, or risk factors, that will differentiate these causes; (iii) to develop and validate appropriate tests to make this differentiation at first and second referral level; (iv) to invest in community health systems and train health workers to recognize these more complex clinical patterns and use these new tests; (v) to estimate the effectiveness of treatments against the various causes through clinical trials which, by virtue of their focus on a subset of all cases of pneumonia, are likely to involve multiple sites; and (vi) to combine all these steps into a rational and appropriate management strategy within developing countries that also integrates attempts to reduce risk factors such as HIV infection, indoor air pollution, and poor nutrition. This represents at least a decade's work, yet the situation we anticipate will arrive in many developing countries before a decade is out. “Early adopter” countries that introduce both vaccines into routine immunization in the next few years will provide useful settings in which to test research ideas.Despite dominating the childhood mortality tables throughout the developing world, severe pneumonia has received little scientific or public health attention for decades. The formation of a Global Action Plan for Pneumonia at WHO and the interest of public health foundations in supporting pneumonia research in developing countries are both welcome reversals of this longstanding neglect [39]. In the context of this renewal of interest, we argue that it is critically important to recognize the rapidity with which the target disease will change across the developing world and to anticipate in the research we propose today the very different clinical and epidemiological spectrum of pneumonia in the future.""]"
2018-06-28T00:00:00Z,"Measuring wealth in rural communities: Lessons from the Sanitation, Hygiene, Infant Nutrition Efficacy (SHINE) trial","['Measuring wealth in a randomized, controlled trial like SHINE is important for a number of reasons, including quantifying inequities, making statistical adjustments for confounding variables and examining effect modification. However, there is no universally agreed-upon approach to such measurement. In this paper, we developed and validated a household wealth index using baseline data for the Sanitation, Hygiene, Infant Nutrition Efficacy Trial conducted in rural Zimbabwe between 2012 and 2017 [11]. In community-randomized trials with a small number of clusters, creating an index has the added benefit that the analyst does not lose as many degrees of freedom as the alternative approach of controlling for multiple factors.Building on the literature and considering the variables important in the local context and to study design (for example excluding variables directly targeted by the intervention), we compared the index to potential alternatives. We find that a “standard” approach (principal components analysis) using a rich, but still relatively parsimonious set of variables is strongly associated with a wide range of indicators of wealth—and is both internally and externally valid. Moreover, an expanded variable set or alternative estimation approach only minimally changes the variation described by the index. From these assessments, we conclude that the SHINE wealth index is adequately robust. We then conducted PCA on all rural households in the 2015 ZDHS to enable a comparison of the distribution of wealth in the two samples using a single common set of weights. In addition to providing evidence of the validity of the index, the paper provides a template for others constructing such indices, including a method for placing smaller regional samples into the broader context of a country when national survey data are available.The results, however, do not imply that the SHINE wealth index is without measurement error. For example, there are possible misclassification errors in the quantile classifications of wealth made using the index, even though the proportion of explained variance exceeds 20% [45]. In analyses where the role of wealth is likely to be highly relevant, analysts may want to consider variations of the index (e.g., employing directly the index value instead of derived quantiles or considering different quantiles since agreement was higher for terciles compared to quintiles) or, on occasion, include directly some of the important underlying characteristics.']"
2018-09-27T00:00:00Z,Oxidative stress and the altered reaction to it in Fabry disease: A possible target for cardiovascular-renal remodeling?,"['In conclusion, this study demonstrates that OxSt occurs in Fabry disease and the reaction to OxSt in terms of antioxidant defenses such as activation of HO-1, is altered in Fabry patients. This dysregulation may play an important role through ROCK signaling induced by OxSt in the cardiovascular-renal remodeling.The extrapolation of the data obtained in circulating mononuclear cells to mechanisms that should take place in myocardial cells could be a limitation of this study. However, it should be noted that circulating blood cells are a valid useful tool in vascular biology to study ‘ex-vivo’ pathophysiological mechanisms of hypertension and remodeling [26]. In addition, it has been increasingly recognized the role of various inflammatory mechanisms such as mononuclear leukocyte infiltration (polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells) and intracellular OxSt for the development of hypertensive target organ damage [26,27]. Furthermore, leukocyte ROCK has been shown to increase the leukocyte infiltration into the vascular wall resulting in the proinflammatory cytokines [28] and an increase in ROCK activity in peripheral leukocytes has been shown in patients with hypertension [29].The findings provided by this study add further information in the pathophysiology of Fabry disease, although, given the small size of patients studied, an unavoidable consequence of the rare nature of Fabry disease, our conclusions should be considered preliminary. In fact, if on one hand this study being, to our knowledge, the first which uses a molecular biology approach to investigate the presence of OxSt in Fabry disease, might justify the limited number of the patients enrolled, on the other hand the results of this study could serve as a useful working hypothesis for further studies with a larger number of patients enrolled as well as to compare Fabry patients treated and not treated with ERT in order to evaluate and more conclusively demonstrate the role of OxSt and OxSt-induced inflammation in the cardiovascular-renal remodeling of Fabry disease. Moreover, a better understanding of the specific molecular signaling response to OxSt in Fabry disease could suggest additional interventions by either pharmacological or nutritional measures aimed at halting the progress of cardiac and cerebrovascular disease, and nephropathy that occur in Fabry patients via the reduction of oxidative stress.']"
2017-11-16T00:00:00Z,Effects of increased levels of atmospheric CO2 and high temperatures on rice growth and quality,"['\nResponses of ecological indices to increased CO2 and temperature\nPhenology, an important ecological feature of rice, indicates whether the plant developed a growth and development pattern that allowed it to adapt to the periodic variation of temperature conditions over a long time [11]. Previous studies showed that an increase in atmospheric CO2 and temperature would accelerate the growth process of plants [13–14], and high levels of CO2 would cause the rice to enter the blooming stage earlier, while high temperature would cause rice to have an earlier heading stage [15]. Based on the test results of a simultaneous increase in CO2 and temperature in the present study (Table 1), these increases shorten the entire growth stage by 26 days, with higher proportions occurring in the elongation and filling stages. This finding indicates that a simultaneous increase of CO2 and temperature would make rice plants have an earlier leafing and blooming stage while the entire growth stage would be shortened. This phenomena may be caused by the acceleration of material migration in these two rice growth stages under the high level of CO2 enrichment and temperature increasing [16, 17], which is similar to findings of previous studies.\nLeaf area is a basic index used to measure the transformation of light energy into chemical energy within plant leaves [17]. Previous studies have shown that leaf area enlarged as the availability of atmospheric CO2 increased, and an increase of CO2 had a certain manurial effect on the growth of rice leaf area [18]. However, leaf area declined as temperature rose, and increased temperature had a certain inhibiting effect on the growth of rice leaf area [15]. The results of the present study showed that with an exception of the seedling stage, the leaf area decreased to a different extent as CO2 and the temperature increased in other growth stages under different treatments (Fig 1A). The reason may be that under the M and H treatments, the temperature rose to 30–40°C, which exceeded the optimum temperature range for rice growth (usually 35°C), causing high temperature stress to inhibit the generation of photosynthates [17], and reduced dry matter accumulation, which offset the manurial effect of increased CO2 on rice leaf area growth.\nThe plant height was proportional to yield and quality within a certain range. For high-yielding rice varieties, the internode length under the ear of rice plus the length of the ear equaled to 45–50% of the plant height [14, 18], with large-size grain, which influenced the appearance and quality of rice. According to the results of previous studies, rice plant height significantly increased after an increase of CO2 and temperature [19]. The present study found similar results with a simultaneous increase of CO2 and temperature (Fig 1B). Probably because the effects of increased CO2 on plant height formative factors were an independent genetic expression, the inner relationship was not prone to be influenced by high temperature.\n\nResponse of rice physiological indices to the increase of CO2 and temperature\nPlants require malondialdehyde (MDA) for plant survival. MDA is an oxygen-containing substance with strong oxidizing capacity that is generated when oxidoreduction was incomplete in aerobic metabolism; a high concentration of oxygen-containing substances may cause strong harm to plant cells [20]. When environmental stress acted on the plant for a long time, a plant would generate membrane lipid peroxidation and accumulate MDA, the product of membrane lipid peroxidation; therefore, more MDA meant the plant was obviously experiencing stress [21]. The results of the present study showed (Fig 2A) that in the seedling, heading and filling stages, levels of MDA were not significantly different in rice leaves, and the MDA level gradually decreased as CO2 and temperature simultaneously rose. This finding indicated that the treatments in the present study did not cause stress to plant leaves. This was mainly because in the present study, after the temperature rose, the range of variation in the maximum temperature in the rice growing stage was 28–34°C (S1 Table), which didn’t cause obvious high temperature stress. In addition, the manurial effect of CO2 may offset some impairment to membrane lipids.\nProline (Pro) is an important organic osmotic substance in the plant. Almost all adverse situations, such as drought, high temperature, low temperature, freezing, malnutrition, disease, air pollution and so on, would cause proline accumulate in the plant [22]. Pro could maintain the protoplasm and environmental osmotic balance, prevent water loss and also serves as a nitrogen reserve substance providing the energy needed to recover growth [23]. To a certain extent, Pro content in the crop reflected the water content in the crop and Pro content increased in case of water shortage [22]. The results of the present study showed (Fig 2B) that proline content significantly increased during the heading stage but under 650 μmol·mol−1 +4°C treatment, the proline content change was mostly lower than that under the CK treatment. This finding indicated that the interaction effect of high CO2 and temperature rise didn’t cause serious stress to plant growth, mainly because high CO2 increased the water use efficiency of the plant, thereby decreasing the Pro content in the rice leaves [24].\nSoluble protein (SP) was the main form of plant nitrogen, as well as the main material used to regulate and control plant metabolism. The change in SP reflected the plant synthetic and metabolic ability, so SP has usually been used as an important index to measure the degree of leaf aging [25]. The results of the present study showed (Fig 2C) that SP content initially decreased and then increased in both the seedling and filling stages, and gradually decreased in heading stage. SP in these three stages did not vary widely, perhaps because the daily average temperature increased faster in the heading stage, caused premature leaf aging, and accelerated the function of leaves synthesizing protein and sending it to the grain, thereby making the SP content in the heading stage decrease rapidly [26].\nSoluble sugar serves as the main form of plant carbon nutrition, which provided energy substances for the plant and played an important role in sustaining the stability of plant protein [27]. Soluble sugar that accumulated in the plant cell participated in osmotic protection, osmotic adjustment, carbon storage, and the removal of reactive oxygen; the variation in SS content is closely related to the photosynthetic ability of rice leaves [17, 28]. Previous studies have shown that a high CO2 concentration would increase the SS content in plant leaves, but there was no agreement on the effect of high temperature on SS. Some studies have been thought to show that high temperature stress would also increase the SS in the plant; SS mainly maintained protein hydrature, reduced the loss of protoplasm water, and was helpful for balancing the osmotic potential between vacuole and cell, thereby decreasing the impairment of lipid membrane and enhancing the plant’s ability to tolerate heat [27]. In the present study, compared to moderate treatment, under 650 μmol·mol−1+4°C treatment, simultaneous increase of CO2 and temperature increased the SS in the rice leaves in heading and filling stages, while in the seedling stage, the SS content decreased as the treatment intensified (Fig 2D). This occurred because a simultaneous increase of CO2 and temperature facilitated photosynthesis in rice leaves, increased the rate of carbohydrate synthesis and conversion, and thereby enhanced the energy source for SS content in the leaves [26, 29].\nSuperoxide dismutase (SOD) serves as a protective enzyme system formed in the cell to defend the impairment of reactive oxygen in the biological evolution process; it could remove potentially dangerous superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide, relieve the impairment to plant cells, and control lipid oxidation. A higher SOD value meant the plant experienced higher stress levels [30]. The results of the present study showed (Fig 2E) that the overall SOD activity significantly increased in the heading stage and was higher than that under CK treatment, while overall SOD activity in both the seedling and filling stages was lower than that under the control treatment. This occurred mostly because the daily average temperature increase in the heading stage was more than that of seedling and filling stages and the high temperature stress reduced the level of SOD activity [24].\n\nResponse of rice quality to increases in CO2 and temperature\nRice quality was mainly reflected by appearance, nutritional and edible qualities of rice; while appearance included the head rice rate and chalky rice rate, nutritional quality included amylose and protein content, and edible quality included gel consistency. These characters directly influenced the overall rice quality and rice sales [31]. The present study showed that an increase of CO2 and temperature caused head rice rate and chalky rice rate initially to decrease and then increase (Fig 3A and 3B), but these were generally lower than that under control treatment (Fig 3C). This finding indicated that high temperature and CO2 impaired the appearance quality of rice and was similar with the results of Xie et al. (2009) [13]. For the nutritional quality, the amylose content had no significant difference under different treatments in the present study; however, protein content under high temperature and CO2 treatment was lower than that under the control treatment (Fig 3D). Gel consistency under high temperature and CO2 treatment gradually increased, which meant the softness of edible quality improved.\nIn conclusion, under increased atmospheric CO2 levels and high temperature, the rice’s phenology shortened, the leaves received certain stress, and the appearance and processing quality slightly worsened.\n']"
2013-03-12T00:00:00Z,Bartonella quintana Deploys Host and Vector Temperature-Specific Transcriptomes,"['B. quintana must survive and proliferate within the body louse vector, as well as the human host, during the course of its infectious cycle. Each of these niches presents the B. quintana bacteria with unique nutritional and environmental conditions. To begin to understand how B. quintana adapts to each environment, we analyzed global transcription in bacteria grown at temperatures corresponding to the human host (37°C) or the body louse vector (28°C). We observed unique patterns of gene expression at each of these two niche-associated temperatures. These genes included temperature-specific virulence factors with known or predicted roles in secretion, iron binding and transport, and regulation of transcription. For some of the genes that were only described as encoding ‘hypothetical proteins,’ we improved the annotation and identified additional, potential virulence genes whose expression is temperature-regulated. Upstream of some of the genes that were up-regulated at 28°C, we identified a conserved, purine-rich motif that could permit coordinate transcription of temperature-regulated, niche-specific B. quintana genes.Our in vitro whole genome transcriptional profiling microarray data from B. quintana grown on agar at 28°C, were corroborated in vivo using RT-qPCR to document up-regulation of mRNA expression in the body louse for two select B. quintana genes. For this in vivo quantification of B. quintana mRNA, we used a novel model for body louse infection that recapitulates the natural route of infection of body lice with B. quintana. The louse infection model utilizes an artificial membrane-feeding system [20] that enabled us to feed lice on human blood inoculated with B. quintana. Future experiments will utilize whole transcriptome analysis to identify differentially up- and down-regulated B. quintana genes in the body louse, as well as the unique environmental signals to which these genes are responsive. From the perspective of transcriptional regulation, we found that the transition from mammalian host to arthropod vector temperature principally involves deployment of different hemin binding systems and the preparation of export systems to adapt to the new niche. During this work, we have developed important tools (in vitro whole genome B. quintana DNA microarray, and in vivo body louse infection with B. quintana) that provide a new understanding of B. quintana host and vector adaptation and will allow further study of the host-vector relationship.']"
2014-02-28T00:00:00Z,"The Standard, Intervention Measures and Health Risk for High Water Iodine Areas","[""The standard committee is revising the Determination and classification of the areas of elevated water iodine and the endemic areas of iodine excess goiter (GB/T19380-2003) according to the survey results. The new standard will upgrade the definition of areas of elevated water iodine (areas with water iodine exceeding 150 µg/L) to the areas with water iodine levels exceeding 100 µg/L. Furthermore, areas in which more than 5% of the local children between eight and 10 years-old exhibit goiter will be regarded as endemic areas. The new standard will be approved and released in the near future.The Surveillance Plan for the Areas with Elevated Water Iodine Levels in China (Trial) has been developed, which determines that the surveillance will sample half of the elevated water iodine counties in Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Henan, and Shaanxi and that surveillance sites will be set up in the villages to survey water iodine levels, children's thyroid sizes, and children's urinary iodine. The plan will be revised and finalised within several years of trial implementation.The survey results have indicated that the supply of non-iodised salt alone cannot ensure that the residents will have adequate iodine nutrition and that water improvement must be adopted as well. The need for water improvement is especially pressing for areas with water iodine levels exceeding 100 µg/L.The goiter rate of the children in Shanxi is slightly higher than other provinces despite no significant differences in the water iodine levels. This observation suggests that other factors may be in play, such as a different type of iodine existing in the water or factors other than iodine.With the increasing water iodine levels, the percentage of pregnant women suffering hypothyroxinemia rises before dropping, and the number of lactating women and women of child-bearing age with sub-clinical hypothyroidism increased eight-fold and four-fold, respectively. Additionally, the number of women who tested positive for TPO Ab increased, and the number of women who tested positive for TG Ab first increased then decreased, and those women positive for both TPO and TG Ab accounted for a high percentage.It is reasonable to define areas with elevated water iodine as those with water iodine levels exceeding than 100 µg/L.""]"
2016-02-16T00:00:00Z,Physiological and Transcriptome Responses to Combinations of Elevated CO2 and Magnesium in Arabidopsis thaliana,"['We proposed a model to show how the combined effect of elevated CO2 and Mg levels regulates the transcriptome profile in Arabidopsis (Fig 9). This model is mainly based on our analysis of gene functions and pathways. In shoots, both low Mg and high Mg induced but elevated CO2 restrained multiple-stress response and cell death, and subsequently immune system process. In addition, CO2 and Mg stresses commonly influenced the primary and secondary metabolism, displaying an inhibitory effect of low Mg but a promoting effect of both high Mg and elevated CO2. Moreover, low Mg specially inhibited photosynthesis including plasma-membrane and chloroplast as well as some related biosynthetic process, whereas high Mg altered leaf shape. On the other hand, low Mg enhanced but high Mg decreased cell wall synthesis and root-hair cell differentiation (e.g. ATXTH17, ATXTH 26, LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT/EXTENSIN 1, EXORDIUM, PRP3, POLYGALACTURONASE INHIBITING PROTEIN 1 and GLYCINE-RICH PROTEIN 5) (Fig 9). Under both low Mg and high Mg conditions, some DEGs were elevated in those involved in immune system functions, in particular, functions related to cell death, and toxin catabolic and metabolic process and defense response. Importantly, elevated CO2 mitigates the impact of low or high Mg on cell wall and root development, which is exactly the interaction nodes of combined treatment of CO2 and Mg. However, the current model still remains incomplete because the integrated output of hormonal cross-talks in response to the combined treatment of CO2 and Mg is complex due to the synergistic, additive or antagonistic effects on signaling pathways. These findings provide new insights in the interaction between CO2 and Mg nutrition on molecular physiology of the plants, which will help to design the novel metabolic engineering strategies to crops (Brassica as relatives to the model species) with Mg deficiency/excess in crop plants under elevated CO2.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0149301.g009\nFig 9\n\nOverview of CO2-Mg regulated transcriptome responses in shoots and roots.\nPutative regulated processes are enclosed in boxes.

2017-09-22T00:00:00Z,"Seasonal variations in carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations and C:N:P stoichiometry in different organs of a Larix principis-rupprechtii Mayr. plantation in the Qinling Mountains, China","['In contrast to natural forests, nutrient cycling within plantation forests can depend on artificial management, and the seasonal variations in C, N and P concentrations and their stoichiometric ratios in different growth stages can reflect the physiological requirements of the plants. However, short-term data could limit the ability to predict nutritional limitations in forest ecosystems, so we attempted to elucidate the tendency of the variation in C, N and P concentrations and their stoichiometries via long-term field experiments in a larch plantation. The results of our study suggest that the variation in the C, N and P concentrations and the C:N:P stoichiometric ratios in different plant organs may be caused by the variation in nutrient allocation patterns or physiological demands in different growing seasons, and the evidence indicated that nutrient limitation in forest ecosystems is a complex phenomenon. Thus, the use of short-term data to judge N or P limitation to plant growth is limited.Our study indicated that the C,N and P concentrations and the C:N and C:P ratios in different plant organs were strongly affected by sampling time and plant age (stand age), and should be considered when compiling datasets across large spatial scales. To address the variation caused by differences in plant development and plant age, we suggest that additional information about these factors should become part of ecological plant stoichiometry. The C, N and P concentrations and the C:N, C:P and N:P ratios in different plant organs are significantly influenced by plant age (stand age), which may be used as a new methodology to understand plant growth and the formation of plant communities.Our study indicated that the leaf N:P ratios varied with growing season and stand age. During certain periods of the growing season, the tissue N:P ratio significantly increased with stand age, and the leaf N:P ratios may continue to increase with increasing stand age and to values higher than 14. This topic is being investigated in a new ongoing project, and further studies are under consideration. Collectively, our results should be applicable to sustainable of larch plantation management and inform the application of optimal N fertilization to stands of all ages in the early growing season in our study region. Further investigations of the relationship between the stoichiometric ratios in plants and the growing season or stand age should be conducted to provide insights into the conservation and management of plantation forests.']"
2016-11-10T00:00:00Z,A Data Driven Network Approach to Rank Countries Production Diversity and Food Specialization,"['In this work we have exploited country-food production data to identify subsets of countries which produce similar commodities or subsets of commodities shared by a given country allowing for visualization of correlations in large networks. We have also applied a non-linear iterative map to rank food specialization and country fitness. Our results highlight how the bipartite country-food production network is nested, reflecting that, on average, countries with high fitness producing highly specialized food commodities also produce low specialization goods, while nations with low fitness producing a small basket of food products, typically produce low specialization food commodities. These results are similar to what was found by Tacchella and collaborators for economic products [9].We envision that the quantitative methods presented here will provide new approaches to fundamental analyses alimented by the available data of country-food security. In fact, there is increasing evidence that a comprehensive analysis of food security and sustainability, food trade must be taken in account, in order to evaluate which countries are dependent on food imports [5, 31, 32], and to estimate the impact of the intensification of the land grabbing [33]. The narrowing of diversity in crop and animal species contributing to the world’s food supplies is considered a potential threat to food security [34, 35] and should be readily identified in application of the framework presented above. For example we find that during the period 1992-2011 Ireland and New Zealand decreased their food production diversity, producing 16 and 22 different food commodities in 2011 instead of 21 and 29 in 1991, respectively resulting in a corresponding ≈ 25% decrease in fitness. We stress that this analysis can be easily applied to study production and trade networks weighted with respect to different nutritional indicators (proteins, fat, calories). As such future work can explore import and export data, food specialization with regards to secondary commodities (e.g. chocolates, breads, cheese) in order to better understand how food trade impacts each country’s fitness and specialization. There is also the ability to investigate the relation between food specialization, food price and price volatility as, combined with the presented analysis on import MSF sub-trees, it may help to develop a framework in which to detect early warning signs of local food crises.']"
2018-12-17T00:00:00Z,Stable isotope signatures and nutritional sources of some dominant species from the PACManus hydrothermal area and the Desmos caldera,"['Our study encompassed several dominant species collected from each of three sites. Although local conditions were different at each site, nutritional relationships and trophic structures were similar for the same species across locations. However, for the two species collected in more than one site (R. vandoverae and M. lauensis), there were significant differences in the isotopic signatures between sites. First, chemosynthetic bacteria were the major primary source of carbon in this ecosystem. Second, the dominant species, including shrimps, galatheids, mussels and gastropods, at these hydrothermal vents were not apparently selective in their food choices, which may be due to the limited range of food sources. As primary consumers, mussels mainly obtained energy from symbiotic bacteria that used RuBisCO form I for the CBB cycle. Mussels also obtained some energy by filter-feeding, but in considerably lower amounts. Symbiotic polychaetes consumed mussels and symbiotic bacteria as prey. Like mussels, gastropods relied mainly on symbiotic bacteria for energy with some supplementary consumption of detritus. Tube worms obtained energy from symbiotic bacteria, but their bacterial species were different from those of the mussels. Finally, crustaceans were found to be omnivorous on chemosynthetic bacteria, detritus, or even animals.Since most of the trophic structure relied on chemosynthetic bacteria and the bacteria relied on reduced compounds from the vent emissions, any disruption of vent emission by mining activities could have major consequences on the trophic structure and finally on vent ecosystem functioning. Moreover, our study suggested that there might be food relationship between animals, i.e., mussels and commensal scale worms. In addition, other members of the vent community must be considered in order to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the vent trophic network. Therefore, to evaluate the potential impacts of deep sea mining, it is necessary to study not only the direct destruction of the organisms attached to the mineral rocks but also the cascade effects on the food web of the whole ecosystem. Furthermore, the dense communities attached to rocks formed several microenvironments and presented high biodiversity. Although the relationship of interdependence among organisms in the microenvironment is not clear, there was no doubt that mining had effects on these microenvironments. Before exploiting deep-sea resources, further systematic investigations concerning the protection of deep-sea ecosystems are deeded.']"
2018-10-15T00:00:00Z,Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc.) flour: A functional ingredient to favour the use of an unexploited sustainable protein source,"['All pre-treatment methods improved dehulling and milling efficiency of BG varieties cementing applicability in flour production. The decisive factor in selecting the preferred method for a specific food application has to focus on the sensorial, functional and nutritional properties of the flour. Colour was affected by roasting, such that roasted flour had a darker colour. Nutritionally, bambara groundnut flour compares with other legumes such as cowpea and chickpea. Varietal differences in chemical properties were minor, except for protein content and ash content, which were much higher in the red variety, making it considerably more nutritious. Consequently, pre-treatment is expected to have more effect on the functional properties of the red variety.Differences in thermal properties due to varietal differences and pre-treatment methods were observed. The flours from the red variety had higher gelatinization temperatures as compared to the black-eye variety, whilst roasting caused a higher onset gelatinization temperature. Starch granule alterations are credited in the increase in gelatinization temperatures. Black-eye flours had lower LGC values than the red variety flours, which can be attributed to the higher starch content in the former.Concerning food applications, the low emulsification and low foaming properties reported, suggests that BG flour is not suitable for food products that require a high percentage of porosity. Therefore, the solution to this will be blending with wheat to improve the properties. The high WAC of dry-roasted flour and combined soaked and roasted flour indicates usefulness of flour especially in food formulations involving dough due to its ability to absorb water and swell for improved consistency in food.In conclusion, based on functional properties, both varieties are recommended for flour processing. No single processing method is optimal, but is determined by the intended application. Based on functional properties, the soaked and combined soaked and roasted flours are recommended for further research in product development and consumer acceptance of locally consumed food products such as porridge, soups, bread, cakes and fritters as illustrated in Fig 6. Nutrient enhancement of staple foods such as maize by blending with flour is also suggested as a way of increasing diversity while at the same time alleviating malnutrition problems faced by marginalised communities.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0205776.g006\nFig 6\n\nPotential applications of bambara groundnut flour in food products.\n\n\n']"
2019-07-11T00:00:00Z,ER-Ca2+ sensor STIM regulates neuropeptides required for development under nutrient restriction in Drosophila,"['This study employed an in vivo approach coupled to a functional outcome, in order to broaden our understanding of how STIM regulates neuropeptides. A role for dSTIM-mediated SOCE in Drosophila neuroendocrine cells for survival on NR was previously established [22]. The previous study offered the opportunity to identify SOCE-regulated peptides, produced in these neuroendocrine cells, that could be investigated in a physiologically relevant context.In Drosophila, both Crz and sNPF have previously been attributed roles in many different behaviours. Crz has roles in adult metabolism and stress responses [43,47–49], sperm transfer and copulation [50], and regulation of ethanol sedation [51,52]. While, sNPF has been implicated in various processes including insulin regulation [28,48] circadian behaviour [53], sleeping [54,55] and feeding [28]. Thus, the identification of Crz and sNPF in coping with nutritional stress is perhaps not surprising, but a role for them in coordinating the larval to pupal transition under NR is novel.A role for Crz in conveying nutritional status information was originally proposed by Jan Veenstra [56], which this study now supports. In larvae, Crz+ DLPs are known to play a role in sugar sensing [57] and in adults, they express the fructose receptor Gr43a [58]. Additionally, they express receptors for neuropeptides DH31 [59], DH44 [59] and AstA [56], which are made in the gut as well as larval CNS. Together, these observations and our study are strongly indicative of a role for Crz+ DLPs in directly or indirectly sensing nutrients, with a functional role in larval survival and development in nutrient restricted conditions.Several neuropeptides and their associated signalling systems are evolutionarily conserved [11,12]. The similarities between Crz and GnRH (gonadotrophin-releasing hormone), and sNPF and PrRP (Prolactin-releasing peptide), at the structural [11], developmental [60] and receptor level therefore, is intriguing. Structural similarity of course does not imply functional conservation, but notably, like sNPF, PrRP has roles in stress response and appetite regulation [61]. This leads to the conjecture that GnRH and PrRP might play a role in mammalian development during nutrient restriction.dSTIM regulates Crz and sNPF at the levels of peptide release and likely, peptide synthesis upon NR. We speculate that neuroendocrine cells can use these functions of STIM, to fine tune the amount and timing of peptide release, especially under chronic stimulation (such as 24hrs NR), which requires peptide release over a longer timeframe. Temporal regulation of peptide release by dSTIM may also be important in neuroendocrine cells that co-express peptides with multifunctional roles, as is the case for Crz and sNPF. It is conceivable that such different functional outcomes may require distinct bouts of NP release, varying from fast quantile release to slow secretion [62]. As elevation in cytosolic Ca2+ drives NP vesicle release, neurons utilise various combinations of Ca2+ influx mechanisms to tune NP release. For example, in Drosophila neuromuscular junction, octopamine elicits NP release by a combination of cAMP signalling and ER-store Ca2+, and the release is independent of activity-dependent Ca2+ influx [63]. In the mammalian dorsal root ganglion, VGCC activation causes a fast and complete release of NP vesicles, while activation of TRPV1 causes a pulsed and prolonged release [64]. dSTIM-mediated SOCE adds to the repertoire of mechanisms that can regulate cytosolic Ca2+ levels and therefore, vesicle release. This has already been shown for Drosophila dopaminergic neurons [17] and this study extends the scope of release to peptides. Notably, dSTIM regulates exocytosis via Ral in neuroendocrine cells, like in dopaminergic neurons.In Drosophila larval Crz+ DLPs, dSTIM appears to have a role in both fed, as well as NR conditions. On normal food, not only do Crz+ DLPs exhibit small but significant levels of neuronal activity (Fig 2D) but also, loss of dSTIM in these neurons reduced Crz signalling (Fig 3I). Thus, dSTIM regulates Ca2+ dynamics and therefore, neuroendocrine activity, under basal as well as stimulated conditions. This is consistent with observations that basal SOCE contributes to spinogenesis, ER-Ca2+ dynamics as well as transcription [65]. However, in our case, this regulation appears to have functional significance only in NR conditions as pupariation of larvae, with reduced levels of dSTIM in Crz+ neurons, is not affected on normal food (Fig 1B). In a broader context, STIM is a critical regulator of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis as well as SOCE, and a role for it in the hypothalamus has been poorly explored. Because STIM is highly conserved across the metazoan phyla, our study predicts a role for STIM and STIM-mediated SOCE in peptidergic neurons of the hypothalamus. There is growing evidence that SOCE is dysregulated in neurodegenerative diseases [66]. In neurons derived from mouse models of familial Alzheimer’s’ disease [67] and early onset Parkinson’s [65], reduced SOCE has been reported. How genetic mutations responsible for these diseases manifest in neuroendocrine cells is unclear. If they were to also reduce SOCE in peptidergic neurons, it’s possible that physiological and behavioural symptoms associated with these diseases, may in part stem from compromised SOCE-mediated NP synthesis and release.']"
2017-02-07T00:00:00Z,Explaining changes in child health inequality in the run up to the 2015 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs): The case of Zambia,"['Childhood ill-health has serious consequences. Apart from increasing under-5 mortality rates, it negatively affects cognitive abilities, education attainment, later life income, and adult health. However, children in low socioeconomic background bear a significantly larger share of childhood ill-health implying that they will continue to shoulder a larger share of these adverse consequences. This raises ethical issues. Why should children from poor backgrounds experience more ill-health when the determinants of ill-health are beyond their control, and to a large extent beyond the control of their parents. How can such inequalities be justified when they are hugely generated by inequality of opportunities to determinants of good health, such as education and health care? Against this backdrop, reducing inequality constitutes one of the most important development goals and is now part of the post 2015 development agenda, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), the successor to the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). To derive lessons for the post 2015 agenda of designing interventions that are effective in improving overall child health and reducing inequality, it is important go beyond asking whether or not inequalities increased by undertaking an in-depth analysis of the forces that drive inequality.We examined the determinants of stunting and fever using the 2007 and 2014 Zambia DHS data to explore the existence of socioeconomic inequalities in childhood ill-health indicators, and whether this inequality changed over the period. Most importantly, we quantified how changes in inequality of determinants and the changes in elasticity of stunting and fever with respect to their determinants could have contributed to the change in inequality between 2007 and 2014.While the prevalence of stunting reduced substantially, inequality increased between 2007 and 2014. In fact, inequalities were worsened by the fact that the prevalence of stunting was reduced in all quartiles, except the poorest. This increase in inequality was largely a result of the increase in the inequality of factors that are associated with stunting. These factors include maternal height and weight, wealth, birth order, breastfeeding duration, facility deliveries and maternal education. Although the responsive of stunting to most of these factors, e.g. facility deliveries, increased in 2014, this benefit mostly accrued to the better off because the factors remained concentrated on the better off. As a consequence, the improved responsiveness of stunting to its determinants also contributed to the increase in inequality.Regarding fever, almost all the increase in the inequality was account for by the increase in the responsiveness of the disease to the factors that determine it. By far the biggest driver of this change was wealth, then maternal education, birth order and breastfeeding duration.The key message in this study is that halting the increase in the inequality in childhood ill-health depends heavily on reducing inequality in the factors that affect childhood ill-health while at the same time improving the impact (elasticity) of these factors using both health and non-health interventions. It is important to note that although improving impact of factors that affect child health is desirable, this in itself can be a source of increase in inequality if the factors whose impact are being improved are unequally concentrated on the better off to begin with.Halting the increase in child health inequality is dependent on reducing inequality in the factors associated with child health. These include wealth, maternal education, appropriate feeding and weaning (related to breastfeeding duration effects), adequate care giving (related to birth order effects) and maternal nutrition (related to maternal height and weight). We believe that a more sustainable way of doing this is to ensure equality of opportunities in access to these factors among children from different socioeconomic backgrounds—who are future parents. This may call for policies that delink the dependence of child health on parental circumstances and the community they live. Specifically, group specific interventions aimed at the most vulnerable may need to be implemented along with population level interventions. For example, under the current social cash transfer scheme in Zambia, policy may aim at providing more cash benefits to the poorest households who have children under the age of five years. Poor households may also have special educational needs. For example, children from poor backgrounds may have challenges learning and concentrating even when given access to school due to persistent hunger. Child school feeding programs may help in improving attendance among poor children and also reducing inequality in learning and concentration.Moreover, despite the fact that all households require appropriate breastfeeding and weaning educational interventions—due to the observed association between duration of breastfeeding and child health—poorer households may require special interventions since they have disproportionately longer breastfeeding durations. In general, the propensity to breastfeed longer may be due to lack of appropriate food or knowledge on how to use existing traditional food stuffs. Thus, policy may focus on introducing and scaling up complementary feeding and nutritional programs among poor households. Additionally, since the community in which a child lives matters for child health, policy may also focus on improving living conditions in disadvantaged communities, e.g. sanitation facilities, water, child care centers, etc. The implementation of such group specific intervention may enhance equality of opportunity and halt the increase in child health inequality.']"
2017-09-29T00:00:00Z,Rearing of Mallada basalis (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) on modified artificial diets,"['This study aimed to improve an artificial diet based on that formulated by Ye et al. [19] for mass rearing the economically important chrysopid predator M. basalis. When evaluating an artificial diet for the rearing of arthropod natural enemies, it is important to consider development and reproduction of the predator species [25]. In this study, we evaluated the suitability of the artificial diets with respect to development, survival, longevity, and reproductive performance of M. basalis. Nutritional imbalances within a diet may be expressed only in subsequent generations [26]; therefore, the development and reproductive performance of M. basalis fed AD1 and AD2 was assessed over two generations, F1 and F2. We found that M. basalis was able to develop and reproduce when fed artificial diets AD1 and AD2. However, the F1 adult longevity and F2 oviposition period in the AD1 treatment was significantly longer than that in the AD2 treatment. The F1 female proportion, F1 daily oviposition, F1 female oviposition, F2 daily oviposition, and F2 female oviposition from AD1 was significantly larger, while the F1 emergence rate, F2 pupation rate, and F3 egg hatching rate from AD1 was significantly greater compared with those from AD2. These results suggested that AD1 was superior to AD2 in supporting development and reproduction. As for M. basalis fed AD2, the duration of F2 2nd and 3rd larvae were significantly longer than for F1. The F2 oviposition period was significantly shorter than that of F1, and the F2 female oviposition was significantly less than that of F1. These results indicated that the offspring of M. basalis fed AD2 were less thrifty. Only diet AD1 contained sucrose and Vitamin C, which suggests that these ingredients may be important nutrient sources leading to the superiority of AD1. The nutrient balance was considered to be more important than the actual amount [22].The duration of larval developmental of M. basalis reared on AD1 was longer than that previously found when reared on C. cephalonica eggs [20], but was similar to the period when reared on other natural prey species such as Icerya aegyptiaca, Ferrisia virgata and Planococcus citri [6, 20]. The pupal duration of M. basalis reared on AD1 was similar to that of M. basalis reared on C. cephalonica eggs, but was longer than of those reared on I. aegyptiaca, F. virgata and P. citri. The adult longevity of M. basalis reared on AD1 was longer than of that reared on C. cephalonica eggs, I. aegyptiaca, F. virgata or P. citri. The emergence rate of M. basalis fed AD1 was greater than that fed on C. cephalonica eggs, I. aegyptiaca, F. virgata or P. citri. The female proportion of M. basalis fed AD1 was greater than those recorded on I. aegyptiaca, F. virgata, and P. citri, but was similar to that recorded on C. cephalonica eggs. M. basalis fed on AD1 produced more eggs than when fed on the four natural prey species above [6, 20]. However, female M. basalis had lower fecundity in the present study compared with those of C. septempunctata fed on an artificial diet containing pork, liver, whole hen’s eggs, brown sugar, vitamins, and preservatives [27]. This may be explained by different levels of fecundity for different species, or perhaps the nutritional quality of the immature and adult diets of C. septempunctata are superior to our M. basalis diets. Pork, liver, whole hen’s eggs, brown sugar, and vitamins are important nutrient sources. The increased fecundity could also be attributed to a higher conversion efficiency.The developmental duration of F1 immature M. basalis reared on AD1 was longer than that reared on an artificial diet consisting of the same ingredients but with no seawater spirulina [19]. A high content of the dietary alga is suggested to support good larval growth and reduce developmental time [22]. Perhaps the spirulina content in the current study was not high enough. However, the F1 oviposition period and female longevity of M. basalis in the AD1 treatment was longer in the present study compared with that fed the artificial diet described above [19]. The daily oviposition and female oviposition of F1 from AD1 was larger, while the F2 egg hatching rate from AD1 was greater compared with that from the artificial diet excluding seawater spirulina [19]. The spiral-alga powder was added as a dietary protein source because of its high protein content [22].M. basalis was successfully reared on a microcapsulated artificial diet [24]. The fecundity and longevity of M. basalis in the AD1 treatment was similar to that when reared on an artificial diet consisting of beer yeast, hydrolyzed yeast, casein protein, propionic acid, honey, bee larvae, sucrose, and egg yolk [24]. The hatchability from AD1 was lower than that from the diet of Lee [24], however, the bee larvae in the diet of Lee is not readily available, resulting in poor reliability for the continuous production of the artificial diet.In summary, the artificial diet AD1 supported development and reproduction of M. basalis better than the diet formulated by Ye et al. [19] for the mass rearing of this economically important biological control agent. The effect of the quality of AD1 on the long-term rearing of predatory lacewings needs to be further explored as this is a key factor affecting the growth, development, and reproduction of M. basalis.']"
2015-02-24T00:00:00Z,One-Seeded Fruits in the Core Caryophyllales: Their Origin and Structural Diversity,"['The one-seeded fruits in the core Caryophyllales are inferred to be an ancestral character state in the ‘Earlier Diverging’ lineages (Rhabdodendraceae, Simmondsiaceae, Asteropeiaceae, Physenaceae) and AAC+CC clade. The origin of the one-seeded fruits is a reversion from multi-seeded fruits in the ‘Globular Inclusion’ clade. The dry and multi-layered pericarp, topographically divided into sclerenchyma as outermost layer(s) and parenchyma below, is an initial state in the core Caryophyllales, with a tendency to reduction in the number of layers in many clades, especially in large families such as Nyctaginaceae and Chenopodiaceae. The wing-like outgrowths of the pericarp that enable anemochory are rare and known only in Sarcobataceae, Seguieriaceae and some representatives of the Chenopodiaceae (subfam. Corispermoideae). Fleshy and coloured fruits evolved several times from dry fruits. The families Rhabdodendraceae, Simmondsiaceae, Physenaceae and Asteropeiaceae are set apart from the other core Caryophyllales in having a thick multilayered fruit wall that is divided into several topographic zones, as well as a distinct seed coat structure. These families also share carpological characters such as massive fruits and a lack of nutritive tissue (perisperm and endosperm) in the ripe seed. The first lineage in the core Caryophyllales with typical “centrospermous” fruit and seed-coat structure is (depending on the topology of the molecular trees) either the American Microteaceae or the Australian Macarthuriaceae. The U-shaped cells with fine-grain crystalliferous content in the pericarp above the inner epidermis are mostly known in the Achatocarpaceae, Amaranthaceae, and Chenopodiaceae (AAC clade).The hard seed-coat testa appears to be typical of the majority of the core Caryophyllales. The bar-thickening of the endotegmen layer can be added as a basic character for many core Caryophyllales. All the members with one-seeded fruits arranged their embryos vertically, and many Chenopodiaceae representatives of different taxonomic position evolved a horizontally oriented embryo as a synapomorphy.Unique, taxonomically important carpological characters justifying family rank have been proposed for Achatocarpaceae (polystarch grains in the seeds) and Sarcobataceae (general pericarp structure), and also for Seguieriaceae and Petiveriaceae (pericarp structure), the latter previously being considered part of Phytolaccaceae. The presence of raphides in the pericarp and seed coats, which is hardly noticeable in the one-layered pericarp, and the seed perisperm that is divided into two parts, are the carpological peculiarities of the Nyctaginaceae. The majority of the small families (Lophiocarpaceae, Microteaceae, Rivinaceae) do not show relevant differences in their pericarp and seed coat structure, although some Rivina species are distinguished by acicular outgrowths of the seed-coat testa.']"
2014-06-02T00:00:00Z,The Gluconeogenesis Pathway Is Involved in Maintenance of Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 in Bovine Intestinal Content,"['Since environmental conditions direct the expression of suites of genes necessary for optimal bacterial growth, our data indicate that the utilization of gluconeogenic substrates may play an important role in the colonization of the bovine intestine by EHEC. Gluconeogenic substrates appear to be nitrogen sources (amino acids) and carbon sources (amino acids, glycerol, L-lactate). Accordingly, it is well documented that the GNG pathway contributes to bacterial fitness in vivo and is required by pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae during host infection [46], [47], [52], [53]. In particular, utilization of gluconeogenic substrates is required for a maximal colonization of the mouse intestine by EHEC [47].Significant levels of gluconeogenic substrates are likely present in the bovine intestinal environment. Lactate-producing bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Streptococcus or Succinivibrio sp. are part of the bovine intestinal microbiota and produce lactate (from carbohydrate fermentation) that can accumulate in the bovine intestine [54]. Aspartate and serine are abundant amino acids present in the mucus of the bovine small intestine [55] and may constitute direct sources of nutrients from the intestinal epithelium. Serine is also part of phosphatidylserine (a phospholipid present in the leaflet of prokaryote and eukaryote cell membranes) and may be released into BSIC from intestinal epithelium and cell debris from the endogenous microbiota. Glycerol is part of phospholipids (phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine) present in cell membranes and, like serine, is released into the BSIC during cell renewal. It is interesting to note that glycerol is used as a dietary supplement for cattle as i) a substitute for starch-based ingredients (such as corn), ii) energy supplementation, and iii) a preventive aid for metabolic problems (such as ketosis) [56], [57]. Glycerol is inexpensive and is currently abundant because it is a by-product of biodiesel fuel production. Consequently there is a renewed interest in incorporating this feedstock into ruminant diets. Interestingly, only 80% of the glycerol added to cattle diets is metabolized anaerobically by the ruminal microbiota [58], suggesting that part of the dietary glycerol can reach the small intestine.The genome-wide expression profiling described in this report highlights the capacity of EHEC to adapt to the bovine digestive environment and opens numerous new avenues for future investigations. In particular, defining the precise role of different gluconeogenic substrates during the growth of EHEC in the bovine intestine should enhance our understanding of their role in the physiology of these pathogens, and may assist us in discovering new nutritional or ecological strategies (for example the use of probiotics) to limit EHEC carriage by ruminants.']"
2013-05-07T00:00:00Z,"Measuring Coverage in MNCH: Determining and Interpreting Inequalities in Coverage of Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health Interventions","['In this article, we have provided practical guidance on assessing inequalities in coverage of health and nutrition interventions, with emphasis on survey data from low- and middle-income countries. From our own experience, we make several recommendations about how best to assess inequalities in health intervention coverage. First, we conclude that there is no single best measure of inequality, and recommend that at least one absolute and one relative measure should be presented when describing inequalities at a given point in time, as well as when reporting trends over time. Second, when comparing time points or countries, we emphasize how important it is to calculate measures that take the whole population into account, and advocate the use of the CIX and the SII. In addition, we strongly advise the use of logit-based SII for the measurement of absolute inequalities. Because the presentation of these indices is particularly appropriate for academic audiences, we also recommend calculation of the differences and ratios among extreme quintiles, because these are easy to convey to general audiences. Third, when assessing change in inequalities, we argue that it is essential not only to evaluate both absolute and relative changes, but also to report how they evolve jointly. Finally, in situations where conflicting results are provided by absolute and relative measures, we stress that it is essential that researchers spell out the different interpretations of these measures to public health experts, because these interpretations are affected by value judgments and are likely to affect the approaches taken to reduce inequalities in the coverage of health interventions.\n        Key Points\n        \n            Recent international calls for increased accountability in measuring progress towards the Millennium Development Goals demand analyses of health indicators stratified by socioeconomic position and other equityrelated variables.\n        \n            Socioeconomic position can be ascertained using many different indicators, but the use of a wealth classification based on assets is the best option for national surveys, being feasible and reliable.\n        \n            Intervention coverage can be assessed by individual indicators, but because combined measures are important for the study of time trends and for cross-country comparisons, we advocate the use of the composite coverage index and the co-coverage indicator.\n        \n            Inequality measures that take the whole socioeconomic distribution into account are essential, and at least one absolute (the slope index of inequality) and one relative (the relative concentration index) measure should always be presented.\n        \n            When analyzing inequality trends, absolute and relative inequality must be studied jointly because there is a clear interacting pattern of reduction or increase in inequality that sometimes produces apparently contradictory changes in absolute and relative inequality.\n        \n    ']"
2018-04-03T00:00:00Z,Digestive enzymes and gut morphometric parameters of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus): Influence of body size and temperature,"['To our knowledge, this study is the first to characterize the digestive activity of G. aculeatus by focusing on three digestive enzymes (amylase, IAP, and trypsin) and three gut morphometric parameters (RGM, RGL, and ZI). Sticklebacks were fed exclusively with frozen chironomid larvae, with constant protein, fat and fiber composition. We chose to control the diet parameter, in order to study the effect of other factors (i.e. size, sex and temperature) on the digestive parameters. In these fixed nutritional conditions, sticklebacks exhibited higher amylase than trypsin activity in both experiments, characterizing an omnivorous fish, which is in accordance to feeding habits of this species, defined by others parameters (stomach contents) in the literature. When considering gut morphometric parameters, RGL and ZI failed to categorize sticklebacks according to their feeding habits, probably due to the lack of dietary diversity.Our study showed no size effect, but a temporal variation of the three digestive enzymes was observed when temperature was progressively modulated to mimic seasonal variation. The activity of the three digestive enzymes was higher in hot periods (with a long photoperiod) and lower in cold days (with a short photoperiod). The highest levels of amylase and trypsin activity were observed at 18°C, while the highest IAP activity level was recorded at 20°C. When sticklebacks were exposed to three constant temperatures (16, 18, or 21°C), no differences were observed among groups, but a significant temporal effect was observed, with inverse evolution of the patterns between amylase activity and the activity of the other two digestive enzymes. The temporal effect on digestive enzymes was correlated with the effect of temperature on fish growth. Cool temperatures (16 and 18°C) favored a high growth rate (based on body mass evolution), while a temperature of 21°C limited growth efficiency even with a daily ad libitum diet. The results of this study suggest that in the context of global warming long exposure to a high water temperature (21°C) could compromise stickleback physiology by affecting their growth. Altered growth parameters (weight and size) were correlated to a decrease in trypsin activity and suggest that this enzyme could be used as a marker of thermal stress in the threespine stickleback.While keeping in mind the specific experimental conditions of this study (calibrated undiversified food ration), these findings can be used to supplement existing data on the digestive process and energy metabolism of threespine sticklebacks. The absence of body size effects on digestive enzyme activity and the response of digestive enzymes to temperature changes can be considered as interesting results for possible use in an ecotoxicological context.']"
2019-03-14T00:00:00Z,"Apple consumption is associated with a distinctive microbiota, proteomics and metabolomics profile in the gut of Dawley Sprague rats fed a high-fat diet","['This work adds valuable information to the literature but there are a number of pitfalls that are important to discuss in order to guide future investigations on the effect of apple supplementation on the gut microbiota and overall health. First, there is great variation in nutritional content (e.g. fiber and pectin concentrations) among different apple cultivars and also between ripeness stages and here we only studied the effect of granny apples at one fixed ripeness stage. Second, fibers and other dietary components affect the gut microbiota at the species level [45] but the 16S rDNA is not discriminative enough to reach the species level. This is important because the variation between subjects involves differences at the species or even at the strain level [46]. Third, the administration of specific bioactive compounds (as opposed to the whole fruit) may have a completely different effect in vitro and in vivo. For example, Masumoto et al. [4] showed that supplementation of non-absorbable procyanidins led to a decrease in the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio. Also, the intake of whole apples or clear apple juice has been shown to produce highly contrasting effects on plasma lipids in healthy volunteers [47]. Fourth, the use of sucrose to maintain isocaloric contents in the diets may by itself be responsible for alterations in the intestinal microbial ecosystem [48]. Finally, in this study we decided to include more animals in the HF group based on what is currently known in the literature, which could have been associated with the presence or lack thereof of treatment effect. However, we performed additional analyses using a subset of samples from the HF group and demonstrated that the observed effect of apple supplementation on the gut microbiota was still noticeable even when using as little as five randomly selected samples from each treatment group (see “Beta diversity analyses” above).In summary, this paper shows that apple consumption has the potential of helping patients with body weight disorders. This study shows that apple supplementation for six weeks has a measurable impact on the abundance of specific fecal bacterial groups in vivo, particularly in the presence of a high-fat diet. This change in composition was accompanied by a change in whole communities, biochemical and inflammatory biomarkers in plasma, fecal and host proteins in colon mucosa, as well as fecal metabolites other than SCFAs, which remained similar. These results suggest unique host response signatures driven in part by the differences in the microbiota colonization and contribute to the understanding of microbiome-host interactions with implications in health and diseases, but more studies are needed to explore different apple varieties at different ripeness stages since apple composition (metabolites, fiber, pectins, etc) will differ among cultivars and might influence differently human and animal health.']"
2014-02-05T00:00:00Z,Crowdsourcing Novel Childhood Predictors of Adult Obesity,"['This paper was one of the first to present crowdsourcing as a potential screening tool to evaluate whether the general public could suggest early predictors that are associated with obesity development. Findings show that participants were able to discover determinants that have been investigated by professionals. Most importantly, participants were able to highlight less well-documented topics which might need more attention in future research. However, some of the well-documented determinants from prior research were not found to be significantly associated with BMI in this study. These two observations highlight both the potential and the limitations of crowdsourcing. By engaging the general public in behavioral research, the crowdsourcing approach enables non-experts to proactively contribute insight to the research. However, because it is difficult to carefully control the quality of the questions submitted or the demographics of the participants, as would be the case with a more controlled study, this approach is most likely only a complement to, rather than a replacement for, conventional research methods. We suggest that insight generated from the crowdsourcing process can subsequently be used to develop new hypotheses, which could be tested in larger, more controlled longitudinal studies.The potential new predictors discovered in this research were largely related to parenting styles and family environment. It would be worth investigating how parents could be taught to educate their children about food in a supportive manner as this ‘positive’ nutritional attitude might have an impact on their children’s eating habits and BMI later on in life. Looking at the general family lifestyle may provide broader explanations for the findings of this study. Given that engaging in outdoor activities with family, hours of sleep, and dietary patterns also emerged as significant correlates of BMI, healthy lifestyle during childhood in general is likely to be associated to a lower BMI later on. Habits learned and initiated in childhood tend to be continued in adult life, and therefore a stronger focus should be put on families as a supportive environment for establishing healthy habits [54].This study also suggests several avenues for improving the crowdsourcing methodology. During this study, it became clear that the simple linear regression model used was not capturing all of the explainable variance in the BMI data. Future work will look at other ways to autonomously build models that better predict the outcome of interest. Better models will make it possible to give better feedback to participants about which questions impact predicted BMI (or other outcomes of interest). Experience with the crowdsourcing approach suggests that this feedback between the website and participants is an important motivator for participation. In future work we will study other ways to motivate participation, particularly ways to encourage participants to return to the site after their initial participation, or ways to find participants from more varied backgrounds.']"
2014-11-04T00:00:00Z,Nowcasting and Forecasting the Monthly Food Stamps Data in the US Using Online Search Data,"[""We proposed the use of Google data based on internet searches about food stamps as a potential indicator to nowcast and forecast the US monthly number of individuals participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as the Food Stamp program. We compared almost 3000 forecasting models and we found that Google based models definitively improved nowcasting food stamps 2 months ahead, while simple linear models (eventually augmented with unemployment rates or initial claims data) are sufficient for nowcasting 1 month ahead. Moreover, Google based models provided statistically significant superior forecasts in case of forecasting 12 steps and 24 steps ahead. More specifically, linear autoregressive models augmented with Google search data for the terms “food stamps” and “jobs”, the unemployment rate and initial claims were the best models for forecasting purposes. In this regard, the best models had specifications always close to the ARX(4) model found using the structural relationship identification methodology by [29] and [30] in the in-sample analysis, thus showing that this approach is a rather robust method of model selection in case of small samples.Nonlinear models performed poorly, were computationally intensive, and in several cases did not reach numerical convergence, with the exception of additive autoregressive models which provided competitive forecasts in case of long term forecasting. Simple periodic autoregressive models performed quite well for 12-step and 24-step ahead forecasts, while more complex periodic models performed poorly, probably due to the high number of estimated parameters which hindered their forecasting performances. Our results hold also with alternative out-of-sample periods which either include the global financial crisis or start after the (official) end of this recession. Besides, our Google based models passed a falsification test which considered the forecasting performance of an alternative Google index chosen by Google Correlate. Similar results were also found when considering the directional accuracy of the models' forecasts. Finally, the estimates for single US states gave similar results to the case of the whole US, even though we found that Google data are very important in case of highly densely populated US states, while their importance is minor for several states with small population.We remark that although we considered a very large set of models, we had to restrict the potential range of models to keep the forecasting exercise computationally tractable. An avenue of future research would be to consider additional models like fractional cointegration, exponential smoothing methods in state space form and many others.""]"
2019-12-02T00:00:00Z,"Strengthening counseling on barriers to exclusive breastfeeding through use of job aids in Nampula, Mozambique","['In the future, findings from this seminal implementation science study on breastfeeding counseling can be used to integrate high-quality breastfeeding counseling content into maternal and child health and nutrition curricula and supportive supervision materials for community and facility levels that address IYCF. The 2018 WHO Guidelines on Counseling of Women to Improve Breastfeeding Practices recommend counseling occur during at least six breastfeeding contacts, which includes antenatal care, the first two to three days of life, the neonatal period (first week), and early infancy (first three to four months), which can be leveraged in Mozambique to address challenges to EBF at key time points and with appropriate frequency [12]. Furthermore, the development of clear lactation management protocols that help providers understand the causes and key ways to address insufficient breastmilk, physical breast problems (engorgement, sore nipples), positioning, and correct latching would be of use in Mozambique. Evidence indicates that breastfeeding problems tend to originate from poor lactation knowledge and management very early on after birth, so it is important to reach women with effective breastfeeding counseling support in health care facilities and at the community [44]. Our findings also call for addressing the excessive caseloads and limited time that health providers have through task shifting to community health workers, as well as early return to work postpartum which is a key challenge to EBF in Mozambique. Finally, as Mozambique has endorsed the WHO Code for Marketing Breastmilk Substitutes [51,52], the MOH and Ministry of Gender, Child and Social Action should join efforts to ensure the criteria for infant formula distribution to INAS are known by all relevant stakeholders and strictly followed.Short-term and long-term investments to improve breastfeeding counseling services during routine contact points and the implementation and sustainability of large-scale improvements in breastfeeding counseling in Mozambique would benefit from employing the Breastfeeding Gear Model as a framework. The Breastfeeding Gear Model can provide countries, such as Mozambique, with practical guidance to address gaps in breastfeeding counseling and propose policy recommendations to strengthen the breastfeeding environment across a number of domains [53,54]. Specifically, the Breastfeeding Gear Model examines what is needed to scale up EBF counseling through eight gears: advocacy, political will, legislation, funding and resources, training and program delivery, promotion, research and evaluation, and coordination and monitoring. Collectively, harmonization of these components is needed to achieve improvements in the scale-up of breastfeeding-friendly environment and in building country capacity in skilled lactation care, which is essential to improve breastfeeding practices globally [55].']"
2013-06-24T00:00:00Z,Beware of Primate Life History Data: A Plea for Data Standards and a Repository,"['\nWe Need to Start Over!\nThus, the answer to our initial question is “no”: the results for Asian colobines and macaques from our analysis [63] could not be reproduced based on the other four datasets. Had we used any of the other existing datasets and not compiled our own, we would still be unaware that gestation length in Asian colobines is significantly longer than in Asian macaques. Furthermore, we would not be confident that interbirth intervals did not differ in the two taxa. These results contrast with the widely held belief that compared to Asian macaques, the more folivorous Asian colobines have a shorter interbirth interval in line with growth measures for captive primates [61], although there is some weak support (a statistical trend) for the idea that colobines have a younger age at first reproduction than macaques. Overall, our present comparisons strongly indicate that there can be marked discrepancies in the results depending on which database was used. Based on standardized variables and by controlling for a few key factors, new insights were gained about life history and dietary adaptations [63]. Together with similar trends discovered for strepsirrhines [71] it is now likely that folivory does not facilitate growth as much as had been suggested previously.\nPerhaps even the general role assumed for protein intake with respect to primate growth needs to be reconsidered. A recent study on juvenile rhesus monkeys emphasized the importance of caloric over protein intake [90]: Females kept on a low caloric-high protein (70%) diet reached menarche significantly later than those on a high caloric-low protein (19%) diet. The same effect is also described for humans in connection with juvenile obesity [91].\nMore generally, at present we do not know if the results of other past life history analyses would hold if based on data that were cleaned-up in a way described here. Clearly this will also depend on the taxonomic level of analysis. Errors of the magnitude identified above might not matter (or matter less) when primate life histories are contrasted with those for rodents because the very large differences should make for strong signals. However, the taxonomic level at which data quality issues no longer have a noticeable effect on results can only be found by trial and error, by re-running analyses at various taxonomic levels and data accuracies. It could be that in the future key aspects at least of primate life history might have to be viewed very differently, with potentially far reaching consequences [25], [92]. It could also be that new directions recently taken in primate life history analysis will have to be revisited such as interpreting differences in the scaling with body mass between gestation length, weaning age and development time (i.e., gestation plus lactation) based on metabolic effects [23].\n\nA New Life History Database\nIn the past, few data for primate life history were available and compilations seem to have been built in a catch-as-catch-can fashion. Researchers were also mostly unaware of the magnitude of the influence that conditions such as nutrient availability could have. This is still reflected in the content of most of the existing compilations, which often build on one another such as the data from Ernest analyzed here which – with respect to primates – rely heavily on the Kappeler & Pereira dataset. In the future, researchers might perhaps want to pay more attention to the quality of existing data, whether they meet the selection criteria required for the analysis planned. For example, if infant survival is not specified for interbirth intervals these data can likely not answer most of our questions. We can no longer unconditionally use what is published.\nThat said, there is a tremendous amount of primate life history data currently available, much or most of it usable in comparative analyses given adequate associated metadata. Therefore we propose building a new, publicly available database. Such a database would specify variable definitions and methods of assessment; it would provide mean values with descriptive statistics, and include metadata on nutritional conditions, infant viability and the like. Many details still have to be worked out before we can reach a standardized level and certain criteria need to be developed with time and practice. For example, when considering nutritional regimes it could be that in the end we can only distinguish between two very basic regimes such as those we did in our current analysis: namely whether or not human-made food was ever consumed.\nCertainly there is also individual variation and there is variation between sites and between species, and such a database that recorded information at the population level would identify and preserve the differences. In addition it is also reasonable to identify a “best value” (central tendency) for every population (and condition) for use in comparative analyses. We need to locate and compile those values, have them proof-read and approved by the people who collected the data, and keep the compilation updated so that future research can be based on the best data currently available. Ideally, in the – hopefully not too far – future new data will automatically be included at the time of publication. Other disciplines already have comparable structures in place such as databases like GenBank® (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank) and standards for database variables like Darwin Core (http://www.gbif.org). Such a life history database is likely to save us all a lot of time in the future and will allow for new and true discoveries.\nAs a final note: We used Asian primate taxa as example because it is the group we are most familiar with. Similar trends and issues as those raised here likely also hold for the other primate taxa and other animal orders and their databases. Try it out. The results might surprise you.\n']"
2018-08-21T00:00:00Z,Preliminary research on total nitrogen content prediction of sandalwood using the error-in-variable models based on digital image processing,"['With the development of “precision forestry,” there is a bright prospect for forestry information inversion and nutritional diagnosis acquired from digital image processing technology. The images used in this study were selected from different forest farms in the northern cities of Hainan Province. We used field servers to capture and monitor the health condition of sandalwood trees, and by using this equipment, a total nitrogen content prediction method was proposed.Differing from previous studies, we defined a new indicator named GS, which includes two versions: GSMER and GSMCC. The GS indicators together with the color factors are all treated as independent variables during the modeling process, and we used the error-in-variable model to estimate the parameters. This study developed a real-time and precise method to predict the total N content of sandalwood that meets the diagnostic requirement of automation. Our conclusions are as follows:\nSandalwood segmentation of field images can be realized by using the Lab color system. Due to its robustness to illumination changes and its large color range, the Lab color system provides a better result than RGB or other color systems. By applying the Otsu method to each channel, we found that the b channel is suitable for extracting green plants from the background, while the L channel is suitable for separating sandalwood from other plants. Therefore, this study combined those channels together with the Otsu method, median filtering, and morphological processing to complete the segmentation algorithm.\nWe propose a new indicator, named GS, which includes two versions, GSMER and GSMCC, to describe the plant growth status. The combination of this indicator with the color factors provides more stable results regarding both accuracy and precision. After adding the GS indicators, the fitting degree was improved. We obtained better results when using GSMCC than when using GSMER. Therefore, GSMCC, the minimum circumscribed circle, expresses growth status more accurately than does GSMER, the minimum enclosing rectangle.\nConsidering that errors exist in both the color and GSMCC indicators, the error-in-variable model was adopted. Because of segmentation errors cause some color-value and pixel-number deviations, the traditional regression method is not appropriate. We found that the results obtained when using the error-in-variable method were better than those obtained using least squares estimation.\nFive types of models are discussed in this study. Each model type was fit with four color systems: RGB, HSI, Lab and RLI. The optimal model of the total N prediction was selected by comparing the R2 and e¯ values obtained from the modeling data and the R2, e¯, δ2, and MSE values obtained from the validation data. The results showed that the exponential function using the Lab color system yields the most satisfying accuracy and precision in regression and validation.\n']"
2018-04-05T00:00:00Z,"Fungal community profiles in agricultural soils of a long-term field trial under different tillage, fertilization and crop rotation conditions analyzed by high-throughput ITS-amplicon sequencing","['The present study demonstrated alterations in fungal communities of agricultural soils in a long-term field trial due to different tillage and fertilization strategies in two distinct winter wheat fields with maize and rapeseed as preceding crops. Crop rotation is widely accepted to stabilize soil structure and fertility, and to positively affect pathogen and weed control. Furthermore—as described here–it exerts strong selective power on soil mycobiome structures. Although, highest wheat yield was in the long term obtained with conventional practice (ploughing and full N-fertilization, incl. fungicides), fungal genera including relevant pathogens were partly enriched in these field plots. Many potential plant beneficial fungal genera responded positively to pre-crop (e.g. AMF) and only marginally to soil management. The highest AMF diversity was detected in the wheat field with maize as preceding crop, but this had no positive influence on wheat yield, since this was generally higher with pre-crop rapeseed. These rather unexpected results indicate that agro-ecosystem functioning is not yet well understood. Simplistic prospects like high relative pathogen abundance leads to lower yield, or high AMF diversity leads to enhanced plant nutrition and thereby higher yield, fall short in such complex interactions.The concept to implement both ITS regions for amplicon generation and high-throughput sequencing was justified by about 30% more detected fungal taxa compared to the results with only one ITS region included. Challenging for future improvement will be the achievement of higher taxonomic resolution by developing opportunities to link ITS1 and ITS2 sequence information. This would facilitate species identification, which is not possible with physically separated ITS1 and ITS2 sequence reads. Although the newly tested primer pairs performed well, primer biases or variable PCR efficiencies cannot be excluded. Additionally, limitations for validated reference sequences in databases and lack of information about functional and ecological roles of specific fungal taxa in agricultural soils impede complete comprehension. The challenge to present a survey about the inventory of fungal taxa in almost 25 years differently managed soils at the same farming site was designed as a baseline study focusing on reproducibility in the replicated field plots. Since this investigation embeds in a long-term research program (BonaRes) encouraging further studies until 2024, this work will be replicated to estimate the stability of soil mycobiomes over time. Investigating temporal fungal community dynamics throughout the growing season will be another future issue. The here basically ascertained crucial impact of long-term farming practice on soil mycobiota may be regarded as feasible contribution for further research. This could support attempts for soil biodiversity-based agro-ecosystem management to improve productivity of different soils with a wide variety of crops.']"
2013-07-29T00:00:00Z,Gene Expression Analysis of Rice Seedling under Potassium Deprivation Reveals Major Changes in Metabolism and Signaling Components,"['In the present study, comprehensive gene expression analysis was performed using Affymetrix rice genome arrays during short-term potassium deficiency and resupply of potassium to deprived seedlings. A large number of genes were found to be differentially expressed. Taking into account the many potential consequences of the gene expression changes we observed, our study emphasizes the major metabolic adjustments associated with adaptation to the stress of nutrient deficiency. Potassium nutrition impacts a number of metabolic, signaling and physiological processes; together these processes coordinate plant adaptation to low potassium conditions.The overlap of low potassium responses with responses to biotic and abiotic stresses attests to the complex physiological changes triggered by nutrient starvation conditions. Under low potassium conditions, a large array of genes are activated, starting from sensing of nutrient deficiency in the soil to the transducing of this signal by activation of a plethora of signaling networks to, ultimately, the regulation of downstream proteins including transporters, enzymes, and transcription factors. We expect that the transcriptional changes in several diverse physiological and metabolic pathways are critical for adaptive responses to plant potassium deprivation conditon. Besides transcriptional regulation, post-translational modulation could certainly constitute another important mode of regulation in response to low potassium conditions. Despite the complexity of responses to potassium deficiency, we have made a hypothetical model to summarize the results of this study (Figure 7). As described in (Figure 7), low potassium influences metabolic processes and impacts genes related to different stress responses. Although, both processes are interconnected by various signaling pathways, the differential expression of individual components might affect the net signaling output of these highly interrelated processes. The changes in expression patterns of these components might govern the acclimation of the plant to such conditions. Further verification of these differentially expressed genes in planta by genetic and biochemical approaches will provide insights into the mechanistic regulation of these gene (s) during low potassium stress conditions, which ultimately can be translated to develop plants that can grow on soil with relatively low levels of potassium without compromising yield and productivity.10.1371/journal.pone.0070321.g007Figure 7\nModel of plant responses and adaptation to potassium deficiency.\nUnder low K+ conditions a large number of genes are affected. This condition alters plant metabolic as well as signaling responses. During K+ deprivation conditons, the initial reaction of plant is to sense the K+ deficiency followed by activation of several genes and gene networks, which might be working in tandem. As depected several genes encoding metabolic enzymes, protein involved in stress signaling, transporters, transcription factors could be the final target to bring about a physiological response such as tolerance or adaptation to low-K+ condition. Putative factors of K+ deficiency and adaptive responses are shown in boxes. Genes of related components are written below the boxes.\n']"
2015-07-06T00:00:00Z,Century-Long Warming Trends in the Upper Water Column of Lake Tanganyika,"['Our update and synthesis of in situ temperature data from Lake Tanganyika demonstrates that long-term warming rates in Lake Tanganyika vary with latitude, distance from shore, and with the seasonal cycle. Though our statistical approach to the incomplete space-time matrix of in situ observations from Lake Tanganyika has limitations, it nonetheless reveals consistent patterns of spatial variation in warming that illustrate a need to assess the spatial dimensions of warming within large lakes. This variation is most likely driven by variation in vertical mixing; areas and times of year with low vertical mixing experience the fastest warming rates. This pattern may be observed in other large lakes with spatial and temporal variation in vertical mixing patternsed quantitativeterpretationof water.odelled in situ temperature revealed important differences between thee methods and a. There are few large lakes where time series of in situ observations encompass a wide enough range of locations to estimate spatial variation in warming rates. Such comparisons have been made over shorter time scales in other large lakes, and have revealed substantial differences in warming across the surface of lakes [35,36]. The analyses of spatial variation in lake skin temperatures for Lake Tanganyika from satellites could be an informative complement to our work on spatially distributed in situ data.The broad quantitative agreement between temperature records from satellites and in situ instrumental data engenders new confidence in the records themselves as well as their implications for climate change effects. Unfortunately, there are few lakes in the world that have temperature records from multiple methods spanning over a century of change. Of the lakes that have well-preserved sediments, few also have both long-term in situ temperature records and surface area large enough for unobstructed satellite-based measurements. Lakes Baikal and Malawi could provide all three types of records, thereby broadening perspectives on the effects of climate change on surface temperatures as well as testing whether our reinterpretation of the TEX86 paleolimnological temperature proxy could be correct for other lakes.As the oxic zone shallows in Lake Tanganyika, aerobic organisms will be forced upward in the water column where temperatures are both warmest already and rising fastest. Higher temperatures exact metabolic costs for these organisms, potentially reducing their discretionary energy available for growth and reproduction [37,38]. Reduced vertical mixing associated with thermal shifts has already diminished internal nutrient loading, leading to reduced primary productivity and shifts in phytoplankton assemblages [11,13,14]. Warm lakes like Lake Tanganyika are especially vulnerable to warming-driven shifts in lake stratification due to the nonlinear relationship between water density and water temperature. The combination of reduced oxic habitat, increased metabolic demands, and lower primary productivity is likely to have negative effects on the lake’s ecosystem and the hundreds of thousands of people who depend on the lake for their nutrition and livelihoods.']"
2019-06-11T00:00:00Z,The relationship between forests and freshwater fish consumption in rural Nigeria,"['Understanding the links between the environmental landscape and food consumption patterns is important for assessing potential trade-offs between forest conservation and food security. For Nigeria, and many other developing countries, fish are a vital source of protein and micronutrients that help to sustain healthy diverse diets. However, the paucity of studies on forest and fish interactions in this region limits our understanding of the importance of forests for wild capture inland fisheries in this region. This study is a first attempt at using existing data sets to investigate whether or not there may be an important link worthy of attention. Here, we find a positive and statistically significant relationship between forests and freshwater fish consumption in Nigeria. This association is particularly strong in the humid and sub-humid regions of Nigeria where forest cover is relatively high. The results from our robustness test showing that this relationship only holds for fresh, and not processed fish, demonstrates that the relationship is not merely a statistical artefact, but indicative of a real relationship. Our findings emphasize the importance of forests for inland fisheries that deliver key sources of food to rural communities in Nigeria.In order to deepen our understanding of these relationships, more detailed purposively collected data are necessary. Greater attention needs to be given to fishing communities in forest landscapes to better account for the importance of fish in rural livelihoods. Data that also targets fish production, seasonality, and fish processing can also enrich our understanding of the relationship between forests, inland fisheries, and food security.The contribution of aquaculture to food production and diets is widely known and acknowledged; [68]; the importance of inland capture fisheries for local livelihoods and diets is, in comparison relatively under documented The research presented here points to forested rivers and floodplains as key contributors to supporting inland fisheries and communities that depend on wild-capture resources, and calls for greater attention on forest-freshwater ecosystems.While there is a common perception that there exists a trade-off between forest conservation and food production, this idea implicitly equates food production with agriculture and most commonly with staple crop production [69]. Aquatic habitats tend to be overlooked in debates about land use and food production, and yet can be critically important sources of nutrient ric h foods that are limited in rural diets in developing countries, particularly for the poor. Research on the benefits and costs of deforestation to local communities has been widely documented (see for example Angelsen and Wunder [70] and Cheng, MacLeod [71]). The evidence presented here suggests that other additional consequences of deforestation also exist that have been relatively unexplored. Deforestation around rivers in particular, could negatively impact fish consumption in areas that are not well integrated into markets. Given the high rates of riparian and floodplain deforestation in Nigeria, a better understanding of what is gained and lost with these land use changes and the potential impacts on the nutrition and health of the communities living in these landscapes is critical.']"
2019-08-28T00:00:00Z,Neural computational model GrowthEstimate: A model for studying living resources through digestive efficiency,"['The neural computational model GrowthEstimate is developed using the combined inputs of normalized weight (g), normalized digestive efficiency (T/C ratio), and protein growth efficiency through the normalized condition factor (CF, 100 × g cm–3). The model could precisely estimate the weight specific growth rate (SGR, % day–1) of living resources, especially in natural marine and freshwater ecosystems where food availability, consumption rates, and growth rates are unknown. However, the trained model should be improved with additional datasets with similar data points from different species at different development stages. Determinations of the activities of trypsin and chymotrypsin in the pyloric caeca and small intestine for the T/C ratio study, including other biochemical techniques for studying the performance qualities of growth and maturation in aquatic living resources, are described in [4,28]. The advantages of simultaneously using different biochemical techniques developed by Rungruangsak-Torrissen and her research team are described [10,12,13,28,51], and summarized in [1–4]. The importance of the specific activity levels of trypsin and chymotrypsin for fish growth is similar to the importance of the levels of acceleration and braking capacity for car speed, respectively. A higher acceleration (trypsin specific activity) is needed to increase car speed (fish growth), and a higher braking capacity (chymotrypsin specific activity) is necessary for stopping a car (fish) at a higher speed (higher growth) [4,13,51].This study provides a research revelation resulted from an excellent collaboration between different research fields in life science (nutritional biochemistry) and computational neuroscience. Insights from the breakthrough of the biological studies [1–4,7] have provided the unique key biological factors, indicating the growth performance quality of living resources through the digestive efficiency T/C ratio and condition factor (as protein growth efficiency). These factors are applicable for practical studies directly in natural ecosystems where individuals in populations, environmental conditions, food availability and consumption rates cannot be controlled. The newly developed neural computational model GrowthEstimate in this study, using reservoir-based recurrent neural networks, is a promising technique for precise and comparable growth estimates of living resources. The GrowthEstimate software, using the weight, T/C ratio, and CF, as its inputs, and providing the estimation of SGR as its output, can be a valuable tool for fishery scientists and other researchers in studying the growth rates of individual fishes, without knowing about food availability, consumption rates, and their genetics. Thus, it can be used as a powerful tool for future food utilization and growth studies, especially in natural ecosystems. Such studies will improve our knowledge and make a difference in studying biochemical effects of environmental impact and climate change on the survival and growth of living resources.']"
2015-07-23T00:00:00Z,Effect of Global Regulators RpoS and Cyclic-AMP/CRP on the Catabolome and Transcriptome of Escherichia coli K12 during Carbon- and Energy-Limited Growth,"['In our study, we have provided a comprehensive analysis of role of the global regulators cAMP and RpoS in E. coli under well-defined carbon- and energy-limited growth conditions. The lack of rpoS resulted in an enhanced fitness both under glucose-excess and glucose-limited conditions, whereas the lack of cAMP had a drastic negative effect on growth performance (Tables 1 and 3). The transcriptome data were confirmed by catabolome analysis, expression of periplasmic proteins and phenotypical analysis. The results obtained with the different methods were consistent. Thus, the picture obtained strongly suggests that the expression of a broad range of high-affinity uptake systems and of enzymes involved in the central metabolism (citric acid cycle and of glycolysis) were severely repressed in the absence of cAMP. Furthermore, the presented results are in agreement with flux analysis [62] and a transcriptome study performed in complex medium [38,39]. Hence, one can predict that the Δcya strain must exhibit a worse affinity than the wild-type strain not only for glucose but also for a broad range of other carbon sources. On the contrary, absence or down-regulation of RpoS would result in increased competitiveness of E. coli in the environment. These results are in agreement with the trade-off between self-preservation and nutritional competence (SPANC [98]). High variability in RpoS expression from several E. coli strains was reported, where high RpoS expression resulted in high resistance at the cost of lower competitiveness, e.g., reduced catabolic flexibility [98,99].The alarmone ppGpp, which is involved in the expression/stability of RpoS [100,101] and is necessary for the transcription of several genes belonging to the RpoS-regulon [102], has also been suggested to be involved in the SPANC balance [103]. The lacking negative effect of the rpoS knockout mutation on transcription of certain stress resistance genes might be due to direct regulation by ppGpp which is, like RpoS, present at high concentrations at low specific growth rates [104].In this study we have demonstrated that the absence of cAMP affects also different classes of genes that are necessary for surviving and growing in the environment. Interestingly, several genes found to be regulated by RpoS were also affected in the Δcya mutant, these genes belonged to all functional groups and numerous genes regulated by both global regulators in our experiments were previously reported to be under exclusive transcriptional control of RpoS. Our data confirm and extend recent suggestions that some genes are regulated by both regulators [38]. Weber and co-workers [37] have shown in a promoter analysis of ΔrpoS transcriptome data that about one half of all RpoS-regulated genes also possess a hypothetical cAMP-CRP binding motif in the promoter region. The transcriptome data reported here can serve as a useful starting point for further analysis of the involvement of cAMP in the regulation of different genes.In summary we conclude that global regulation by cAMP-CRP, but not by RpoS is essential for growth and survival of E. coli in its natural habitats which also explains why rpoS but not cya/crp mutant strains can be isolated from the environment.']"
2019-06-25T00:00:00Z,Youth and forecasting of sustainable development pillars: An adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system approach,"['The young represent the key stakeholders and participants in all the questions that refer to SD and viability, and “has the right of a sustainable future and the right of being part of this transformational process” [56]. They play necessary active role in the adequate decision making processes that relate to integration of all SDGs as well as to each individual SD pillar–economic, social and environmental [57–60]. Therefore, the opinion of young people must be taken into consideration as a necessary element of SD, since their involvement in the matters of sustainability is important for more successful and better functioning of every society [4]. This also points out to the fact that all research that refer to the question of young people and SD contributes to necessary body of knowledge of this crucial issue, having in mind that: “The creativity, ideals and courage of the youth of the world should be mobilized to forge a global partnership in order to achieve sustainable development and ensure a better future for all” [3].Furthermore, to our knowledge an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System–ANFIS has never been applied for forecasting of all three pillars of SD [25–32].The research was carried out on a representative sample of young people of Serbia consisting of 386 respondents, out of which 300 was used as a training set, and the remaining 86 for testing the model.The obtained results included not only the ranking of the importance of SDGs (End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture–rank 1; Ensure access to water and sanitation for all–rank 2; Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all ages–rank 3) but also the predictions with the satisfying accuracy of all three SD pillars (environmental, social, economic): with marks 4.20, 4.121, and 3.94 respectively, and the relative error of < 5%.This study clearly indicates that the applied ANFIS method based on ‘only’ four input variables (gender, age of respondents, current status of education and type of settlement) provides an acceptable predictions of SDG importance. Optimization of the input and output parameters, questionnaire and adequate selection of the research sample, is capable of providing sufficiently good forecasting of the three pillars of SD.Such predictions cannot replace the discussion with the young, but can help steering the discussion in directions that are important to the young people in question. By knowing and understanding what is important to the youth, we can gain their trust and achieve better collaboration in creating SD policies. To our knowledge this is the first application of ANFIS method in forecasting the importance of SDGs from demographic data. Nevertheless, we have to be aware that the ground truth can change in time, a phenomenon that in machine learning is called a concept drift, that is why we should keep updating the model in order not to miss an important change.In the end, we can draw a conclusion that ANFIS model applied in our study can be used in future research (with the increase in the number of respondents and larger training set, as well as with the application of other methods of artificial intelligence and comparative analysis of obtained results and different normalization methods for input variables) in the development of youth policies, local action and environmental plans, and adequate application and development of national strategies and SD policies.']"
2015-05-26T00:00:00Z,A Quantitative Analysis of Growth and Size Regulation in Manduca sexta: The Physiological Basis of Variation in Size and Age at Metamorphosis,"['Our analysis of the growth kinetics of Manduca has revealed several interesting and some surprising features of the regulation of body size and development time that are likely to be widespread among insects, and that raise a number of questions for future research. One question is what causes the progressive increase in the size increment at each molt? The observation implies that the mechanism that triggers a molt scales allometrically with body size. In Manduca the molt is triggered by an oxygen insufficiency imposed by a tracheal system that only grows when a larva molts but stays constant during the intermolt period when somatic growth takes place [17]. Perhaps the mean length or the volume of the tracheal system scales allometrically with body mass. Another question is what causes the decline in the specific growth rate, and why does it converge to approximately the same low value at all temperatures? Perhaps a fully grown larva has a characteristic mix of tissues with different metabolic rates that is independent of previous growth.What controls development time? From a physiological perspective development time is an emergent property. This is because molting and metamorphosis are triggered by size, not by time. Fast growing larvae simply take less time to reach the species-characteristic size than do slow growing ones. Thus the only ways to alter development time is to alter the growth rate or the size-assessment mechanism. Both the critical weight, which controls the size at which each molt will occur, and the threshold size, which controls when metamorphosis will occur, can be altered by selection on body size or development time (this paper and [21]). But we showed here that in very slow-growing larvae the size-dependent mechanism does not operate (see also [17,35]), but larvae molt on a time schedule. This could be a safety mechanism that allows a larva to grow and molt under nutritional stress, much like the bail-out response of Drosophila [44]. Non-size-dependent molts occur after about 7 days. Since a molt is stimulated by secretion of the molting hormone, ecdysone [45], this raises the question of how time-dependent ecdysone secretion is controlled.Perhaps the most intriguing question is what constitutes the threshold size? Threshold size is the ultimate cause of body size, because it determines, indirectly, at what size growth will stop. We define threshold size operationally as the size (which can be measured as mass or head capsule width [19,20]) at the beginning of an instar that determines whether the larva is in the last instar. But this operational way of finding threshold size says nothing about what exactly the larva itself is measuring that correlates so well with mass. The intriguing problem is that threshold size, unlike the critical weight, is not, as far as we can determine, a relative measure. Threshold size in effect determines the species-characteristic body size, which is an absolute measure. Selection on body size can alter threshold size (Fig 4), so there is genetic variability in the mechanism that controls threshold. The comparative study of genetic strains with different threshold sizes may allow us to unravel the molecular and physiological mechanisms of threshold size.']"
2010-06-21T00:00:00Z,"Sub-Saharan Africa's Mothers, Newborns, and Children: How Many Lives Could Be Saved with Targeted Health Interventions?","[""There are three main conclusions to draw from this analysis:\n1. Modest Increases in Selected Outreach Interventions Can Save Lives Now\nMuch can be done at community level for children through improving nutrition, providing vaccinations, and preventing and treating malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia. Community level provision of contraceptives can have a significant impact on maternal mortality. These, with other community-based interventions, can also reduce maternal and neonatal deaths.\n\n2. Addressing Missed Opportunities for Births Already Occurring in Health Facilities Can Also Save Maternal and Newborn Lives Now\nStrengthening existing programs within health facilities could prevent many deaths, even without high-tech equipment and supplies [15]. Many newborn deaths could be prevented with facility-based interventions such as neonatal resuscitation, hygienic practices, and thermal care around the time of birth for all neonates, as well as antenatal steroids and Kangaroo Mother Care for preterm babies. Since more than half of maternal deaths in sub-Saharan Africa are due to obstetric complications, it is critical to ensure that women with life-threatening complications can access the emergency obstetric care that can save their life and that of their baby.\n\n3. Consideration of Local Data and Different Health System Settings Is Necessary to Identify High-Impact, Short-Term Opportunities That Are Appropriate and Feasible for Given Health System Environments\nWhile much is known about interventions that can save lives, there are still unanswered questions regarding the “who” and “how to” around optimal service delivery strategies, providing care to families close to home, and reaching hard-to-serve populations. There is a gap in the use of local and representative data to inform policy, practice, and research priorities. There is also an urgent need to strengthen and disseminate existing tools such as LiST to assist governments and policy makers, including at the local level, in setting priorities and targets. Once evidence-based priority interventions are identified, it is necessary to link these interventions to policy as well as to address implementation challenges. There are a number of immediate opportunities available even in the lowest resource settings; however, a shortage of qualified health workers is a major constraint for improving essential health care in sub-Saharan Africa [46]. This is true both in direct service provision as well as in lack of public health champions to lead the way towards policy change [47]. More health systems research is needed on optimum delivery strategies for specific interventions and health care packages given existing constraints, and on how to increase coverage with existing packages within individual countries [19].\nDespite often negative publicity, some African countries are making progress towards saving the lives of mothers, newborns, and children. Even more lives can be saved if countries use local data to identify priority interventions and increase coverage and quality in the short term. Local and national governments and policy makers should be encouraged to use science to inform effective action to save the lives of sub-Saharan Africa's mothers, newborns, and children.\n""]"
2018-10-17T00:00:00Z,Mule deer impede Pando’s recovery: Implications for aspen resilience from a single-genotype forest,"['This first comprehensive assessment of conditions at the famed Pando aspen clone reveals an ancient forest threatened by recent human decisions. A vital lesson derived from this study is that independently managing vegetation and wildlife may harm both. While several human alterations to this forest have taken place in recent decades, it is the lack of simultaneous herbivore regulation that has caused this stand’s degeneration. Here and previously [23] we have documented some successes with experimental treatments combined with post-treatment browse protection that show promise for Pando’s outlook. Through these tests and our aerial photo documentation of 1987–88 failed cutting experiments, it is clear that both passive and active management cannot be successful without mitigating herbivory. Positive results within the 2013 fence unfortunately contrast with continuing recruitment failures outside the fence, as well as within the 2014 fence. The majority of this giant clone remains either insufficiently protected via a penetrable fence or totally unguarded from herbivory; both instances are expected to yield a greatly reduced clone and cascading effects to obligate species [1,53–55]. Moreover, we highlight that post-disturbance stable-type aspen forests such as Pando require a complex vertical stand structure for system resilience [13,31–32]. Even where a 25-year-old clearfell and fence yielded advanced recruitment today, no successful reproduction since that time presents significant concerns. Greater vigilance will be required in future forest-herbivory management via deer and cattle exclusion, increased animal movement, or population reductions if we wish to see a rebounding and resilient Pando clone.This spatially confined study on a genetically uniform aspen forest in Utah has broad ramifications for aspen management at-large; the issues found here are mirrored across the ranges of the most widespread tree species in the world (i.e., P. tremuloides, P. tremula; [3,48–49,55–56]). As we begin to understand growth and defense mechanisms linked to genotype, there is potential for altering aspen-herbivore strategies accordingly. We may use this relatively simple system, which is still an entire forest, as a building block for understanding and mitigation of herbivore impacts at larger scales in multiple-clone landscapes with greater diversity of defense chemistry allocation. Likewise, experimental tradeoffs between nutrition, defense, growth, and response to disturbance may be compared to this iconic clone as a starting point for understanding long-term survival of aspen communities under duress.While conservation efforts are commonly aimed at rare species within specialized niches, a habitat approach affecting a broad array of aspen-obligates at continental-scales may be a more effective strategy for preserving greater overall biotic integrity. Impacts of overabundant wild ungulates are often overlooked by preservationists, policymakers, and the public because of their perceived benign effects [56]. What many conservation efforts have failed to implement thus far are coordinated strategies of forest-herbivore stewardship, particularly at regional and multinational scales [3,13,57]. Such approaches not only promote ecological, process-based, landscape management, they have the added benefit of clearly linking human decision-making to cascading ecological consequences. There should be no confusion over the point that both domestic and wild herbivore populations are governed by people’s preferences and actions, and that those decisions result in long-term consequences for ecosystems writ large.']"
2014-08-14T00:00:00Z,Schistosome Feeding and Regurgitation,"['Due to their importance as agents of disease morbidity, schistosomes are the most widely researched parasitic flatworms and quite possibly helminths in general. The habitat of adult worms in the bloodstream provides a perpetual and rich source of nutrients. Earlier research on parasite composition emphasised the sheer scale of the feeding process, especially in the female worm. More recent studies have highlighted the mechanisms which mediate this process; a synopsis both of current knowledge and areas of uncertainty is provided in Box 1 and Figure 4. Our contention is that the success of schistosomes as pathogens can be attributed in part to the unique and complementary balance between active feeding via the alimentary tract and nutrient uptake across the body surface.10.1371/journal.ppat.1004246.g004Figure 4\nPathways for diffusion of nutrients in male and female schistosomes.\nConfocal images of stained adult male (left) and female (right) schistosome cross sections at the same magnification (yellow, phalloidin for actin; blue, DAPI for nuclei; green, tegument and gut). The parameter values are the mean of 12 females and 11 males in near perfect cross section. Areas and distances were measured using the polygon line and path tools in the Analyzing Digital Images package from the Lawrence Hall of Science, Berkeley, California (http://www.globalsystemsscience.org/software/download). Solid white arrows show diffusion distances from the tegument surface to the midpoint, dotted white arrows those from the gut lumen to the furthest extremity. The gut lumen of the female occupies 9.7% of the cross section, that of the male only 1.9%. Nutrients diffusing from the male gut would have to travel >400 µm to reach the furthest tissues whereas the maximum distance from the female gut is only 85 µm. The distance a nutrient has to diffuse from the tegument surface to the tissue midpoint in both male and female is very similar at ∼40 µm. Central boxes list metabolite classes that are transported across the tegument (upper box, yellow arrows) or via the gastrointestinal tract (lower box, yellow arrows). Metabolites that have been shown experimentally to be transported are listed in the upper group in each box. Those that have been inferred to be transported from proteomic, transcriptomic, or other work are indicated by italics.\n\nBox 1. A Synopsis\nBody shape: The disparity between the dorso-ventrally flattened male and the almost cylindrical female (Figure 4) undoubtedly has a marked influence on their respective metabolic predispositions. The physical constraints imposed on the diffusion of small molecules through tissues must favour the tegument as the predominant site of nutrient uptake in males, whereas an even balance between gut and tegument is more likely in females.\nThe tegument and gut epithelia: Neither the pitted, sponge-like tegument nor the gastrodermis with its surface lamellae are typical of the solute-absorbing, microvillus-bearing surfaces found in the tissues of higher animals. This must reflect the ancient evolutionary origins of the schistosomes, with a triploblastic but acoelomate body plan, so novel aspects of nutrient uptake might be anticipated. Secretion of lysosomal enzymes into a gut lumen that operates at <pH 5.0 is one example.\nThe feeding cycle: Another male/female disparity is the size of the oral/esophageal pump relative to the blood consumed. The pump in the female is only one-fifth the size of that in the male but must move 8.5 times the volume of blood, so needs to work 40 times as hard. This makes it highly likely that females feed continuously, with short interruptions for regurgitation of hemozoin, whereas males feed intermittently (the male cannot ingest blood while using its oral sucker to transport a female along blood vessels). A feeding/digestion/regurgitation cycle in males would explain why they come in various shades of brown while females are more uniformly black.\nEsophageal gland function: The demonstration that the esophageal gland plays a central role in blood processing has added an extra dimension to schistosome nutrition. A small number of products has already been identified, but characterisation of the secretions and definition of the roles of individual proteins presents a major challenge. How erythrocytes are lysed, leucocytes are trapped and damaged, yet blood coagulation does not block the esophagus are the principal questions to be tackled.\nWater-salt balance: Worm bodies do not become bloated as they feed, so the ingested plasma fluids (water and salts) must be continuously expelled—in the female, the equivalent of 4.4 body volumes per day. Since vomitus is a thin and infrequent trickle, regurgitation can only play a minimal role. That leaves the protonephridial system, which ramifies through internal tissues but is poorly understood, or the tegument, where aquaporin is very abundant in the surface membranes. As lactate is expelled via aquaporin pores [65], excess water may travel the same route, and the Na/K pump in the tegument membranes is also likely involved. The 8-fold disparity in plasma fluid intake means that the female has a much greater task than the male, and this must represent a significant metabolic burden.\nAmino acids and proteins: No quantitative estimates of amino acid uptake by medium depletion are available to compare with those for glucose. However, amino acid transporters are present in the tegument surface and may be especially important in male tissues distant from the gut (Figure 4). Nevertheless, in the female the amount of blood protein ingested (4.5 times dry weight), coupled with shorter diffusion distances, likely make it the dominant source. Undoubtedly this reflects the much greater exported biomass of eggs from females (∼300 per day in S. mansoni, ∼2000 in S. japonicum) compared to that of sperm produced by males. The current paucity of information on the gastrodermal transcriptome and proteome is an obstacle to understanding gut function. The recent paper on schistosome organ isolation may provide a way forward [66].\nCarbohydrates and energy metabolism: The tegument is clearly the predominant route of glucose uptake for ATP generation in both sexes. A minor transport component is possible via the gut, involving special sugars (e.g., for glycan synthesis). It is notable that females take up less glucose but ingest greater amounts of amino acids (as protein) than males. The possibility that the amino acid carbon skeleton is used in females for ATP generation has not been explored, although the requisite transaminases and aminotransferases are encoded in the genome.\nLipids: Despite some effort, there is no significant evidence for uptake of essential lipids across the tegument, so we must assume the gut is the dominant route in both sexes; indeed, the presence of the membranocalyx may preclude lipid entry to the tegument. The multiplicity of saposins in the gut lumen, plus the Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) cholesterol transporter homolog reinforces this conclusion. Lipid droplet transcytosis across gut epithelium is a possibility, but has not yet been demonstrated by feeding experiments, as performed with dextran.\nEpilogue: Once established in the bloodstream, schistosomes are hard to eliminate. The tegument and alimentary tract are the principal interfaces with the host so a better understanding of the functions they perform should provide avenues for more effective interventions. Is there scope for new diagnostic markers among the gut secretions expelled in vomitus? Are the transport proteins in both tegument and gut membranes suitable targets for pharmaceutical intervention? Do the esophageal gland secretions represent a novel cohort of vaccine candidates that can be targeted to disrupt blood feeding? Are females, with their greater nutritional requirements, more susceptible targets than males, a feature that would reduce transmission?\n']"
2018-03-01T00:00:00Z,Diagnostic tools for soil-transmitted helminths control and elimination programs: A pathway for diagnostic product development,"['The success of the current WHO STH control strategy has catalyzed interest in moving beyond coverage estimates and morbidity control to improving program efficiency and exploring the prospect of breaking the transmission of STHs to reduce resources required for sustaining vertical STH programs. These aspirations require surveys of the targeted populations, and the aim of the hypothetical use-cases was to simulate STH program decisions requiring diagnostic information. The context within these use-cases frame performance and implementation requirements for the design and evaluation of existing and new tools. This approach ensures that user needs are the destination of a research and product development road map, instead of forcing the adoption of an imperfect technology. In the best-case scenario, one technology is able meet the requirements of multiple TPPs.The current TPP for use-case #1 and #2A addresses the needs of morbidity control programs but does not address the needs of elimination programs that would initiate or continue in lower transmission settings (e.g., <20% apparent prevalence). The Kato-Katz method meets most, but not all, of the minimum criteria in this TPP, as it offers sufficient analytical and clinical sensitivity but does not meet precision and reproducibility criteria (§2.5 and 2.6), nor does it meet regulatory requirements (§3.1). New tools that meet all requirements described in this TPP are needed as one step towards strengthening STH program efficiency. Opportunities for improvement are also highlighted in Table 1, and as with any new tool, it is important to consider manufacturability, use, and cost-effectiveness from the program perspective.STH programs that aim to move beyond morbidity control towards interruption of transmission are described in use-cases #2B, #3, and #4. Tests for use-case #2B will require a lower LOD than use-case #2A, but there is insufficient information to provide definitive criteria, as this approximates the transmission breakpoint. There is a need to define the epidemiological characteristics of a transmission breakpoint to understand the risk criteria of an individual’s contribution to STH transmission within a given population. This is challenging given the wide range of contextual factors that define population heterogeneity, such as seasonality, individual health/nutritional status, environmental exposure, and/or social behaviors. These factors may influence STH transmission and thus, also, breakpoints [52]. Mathematical modeling and animal studies can approximate the extent of these potential contributions to guide definitions of phenotypic characteristics (§2.1), information necessary for defining clinical utility requirements of biomarkers. A TPP for use-case #2B and #3 diagnostics also requires proof of concept that programs can interrupt transmission in a scalable and cost-effective manner, with a strategy that verifies decision points requiring diagnostic surveys and test implementation scenarios (timing, sampling size, etc.).Diagnostic needs will adjust over time as emerging research continues to evolve program strategies. These TPPs and use-cases are living documents that capture the current trajectory of STH programs to identify gaps that can be addressed through research and product development.\n\nKey learning points\n\nThe soil-transmitted helminth (STH) community has started exploring opportunities to strengthen a control program’s ability to monitor changes in prevalence of infection, potentially to a reduction that is sustained below transmission breakpoints.\nCurrent global strategies have been successful with existing diagnostics, and more ambitious program end points would likely require different tools to evaluate the impact of population-directed interventions.\nNewly created target product profiles (TPPs) described in this article aim to direct the development and evaluation of diagnostic tools that improve the efficiency of control and elimination programs.\nThe STH community lacks a tool to confirm a break in transmission, and based on the new TPP, critical evidence to inform the development of this diagnostic is currently unavailable. Additional research is needed to define species-specific transmission breakpoints and guide the translation of individual-level test results to population-level transmission indicators.\n\n\n']"
2016-05-19T00:00:00Z,Complexities and Perplexities: A Critical Appraisal of the Evidence for Soil-Transmitted Helminth Infection-Related Morbidity,"['In this manuscript, we have found that there is a paucity of recently collected data to inform our knowledge of STH morbidity. In particular, relatively little quantifiable evidence of STH morbidity has been forthcoming in recent years. Of the evidence that has been provided, few firm conclusions can be drawn. Perhaps this, too, is a reflection of the insidiousness of STH. Alternatively, this could be partly a result of trials that are powered to measure different primary outcomes; secondary morbidity outcomes may therefore be inadequately powered for effects to be detectable. Furthermore, this may be because intervention trials are impossible to conduct over sufficient time periods to assess deworming impacts on morbidity in the manner that such programmes are delivered in real-world settings (i.e., repeated rounds administered throughout childhood). There is also a possibility that our review has applied selection criteria that could have excluded key evidence. We considered that applying these criteria was the most accurate way to differentiate between direct and indirect STH morbidity measures. The main discrepancy that the Cochrane systematic review highlights is insufficient and heterogeneous underlying evidence. This is reinforced by our own findings.We do have an evidence problem regarding STH morbidity and health effects of deworming. The use of prevalence and, to a lesser extent, intensity of infection as indicators for intervention planning, monitoring, and evaluation may have reduced the impetus to investigate more direct morbidity measures. As a consequence, we might not currently be able to prove the benefits of deworming. Furthermore, evidence of morbidity may become increasingly hard to detect over time if prevalence and intensity continue to reduce in populations. This is obviously a good outcome, but a poor basis upon which to make any assessments. Our main conclusion is that further investments in appropriately designed studies that are powered to measure changes in direct STH morbidity indicators are urgently required.\n\nKey Learning Points\n\nThere is a paucity of quantifiable evidence of STH morbidity in recent years when assessed by direct morbidity measures such as changes in height, weight, haemoglobin, and cognition.\nThe most recent Cochrane systematic review has assessed possible benefits of deworming on morbidity outcomes by pooling RCTs of deworming regardless of individual infection status, STH species, type of anthelmintic drug, and distribution strategy. In our opinion, this is methodologically inaccurate given current knowledge of STH heterogeneity. There may be insufficient evidence to prove benefits of deworming, but this is not the same as the authors’ conclusion of lack of an effect.\nCareful consideration needs to be given to use of systematic reviews of RCTs for measuring improvements in morbidity from deworming. Furthermore, there needs to be clarification of the role of observational evidence for assessing STH-associated morbidity given that not all morbidity investigations are feasible within an RCT design.\nStudies designed to detect direct morbidity from STH are urgently required to strengthen evidence for deworming.\n\n\n\nTop Five Papers\n\n1Taylor-Robinson DC, Maayan N, Soares-Weiser K, Donegan S, Garner P.

2013-12-20T00:00:00Z,Social Aggregation in Pea Aphids: Experiment and Random Walk Modeling,"[""Through experiment and modeling, we have investigated the movement, social behavior, and aggregation of the pea aphid. Motion-tracked experimental data gives rise to a two-state model in which aphids transition stochastically between stationary and moving states. Moving aphids follow a correlated random walk. The state transition probabilities PMS and PSM, the random walk step length , and the random walk turning angle distribution spread ρ all depend on distance to an aphid's nearest neighbor, d. These four quantities have each been fit with a functional form incorporating three or four parameters whose values we estimated from the experimental data. To assess the efficacy of our model in reproducing group-level behaviors, we compared experimental data to outputs of our social nearest neighbor model and a control (noninteracting) model. We found that the social model reproduces the distribution of nearest neighbors and the distribution of fraction of moving aphids better than the control model. The experiment and both models display no difference for a third group-level property, namely angle to nearest neighbor.Our mathematical model is strikingly different from some previous data-driven aggregation models. The model of golden shiner fish in [30] and the model of surf scoter ducks in [32] are primarily deterministic, describing organisms that simultaneously attract, repel, and align. In these studies, noise additively modulates an organism's intended direction at each time step, presumably to describe errors in sensing and movement capabilities. In contrast, our model has rules that are fundamentally random. Fig. 2 shows that aphids under similar conditions (same distance to nearest neighbor) display different behaviors (transitioning vs. not transitioning motion state). Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 suggest that the movement process for aphids is a random walk.The biological conclusions of our work are as follows. First, we have provided strong quantitative evidence that pea aphids display social behavior, in that an individual's movement in a featureless environment is influenced by its nearest neighbor.Second, we have gained insight into the mechanism by which aphids aggregate. The probability of a stationary aphid starting to move decreases if a neighbor is nearby. The probability of a moving aphid stopping increases if a neighbor is nearby. These two behaviors promote aggregation. Further, aphids that are moving take shorter steps and turn more when in the vicinity of neighbors, promoting motion that is more diffusive and less ballistic (that is, less likely to move it away from the neighbor). This is reminiscent of the classic run-and-tumble model of bacteria [53]. In short, aggregation occurs through movement decreasing in the proximity of other aphids as opposed to direct locomotion towards individuals or clusters.ThirdFinally, our model of individual-level behavior gives some feeling for the sensing range of the aphid. We recall the exponential length scales , , , and . These characteristic length scales are on the order of 1–3 aphid body lengths.As evidenced by the metrics in the previous section, our individual-based social model reproduces group-level featuresbehaviors muchbetter than a control model. There remain many avenues for further investigation. While we have demonstrated that pea aphid behavior promotes aggregation, we have not focused on quantifying the degree of aggregation (beyond measuring the distribution of distance to nearest neighbor). One could investigate the typical population size of an aggregation and the typical time scales of an aggregation's formation and existence. Furthermore, we have not captured all of the experimental complexity in our simple model. As mentioned throughout, we have ignored the effects of the boundary. It would be useful to quantify more precisely the rules an aphid obeys when it encounters an immovable obstacle such as a boundary. Additionally, our model is arguably the simplest possible social model, in which social effects depend on a single nearest neighbor. One could investigate the degree to which an aphid responds simultaneously to multiple neighbors, keeping in mind the limits of aphid cognition. Finally, it could be interesting to augment our work, which describes aphid aggregation the absence of environmental cues, with a consideration of external factors such as nutrition sources. Such an investigation might shed further light on the aphid's role as a destructive crop pest.""]"
2013-10-10T00:00:00Z,Understanding the Sustainability of Retail Food Recovery,"['In this paper we provide the first formal investigation of the fundamental sustainabiliy of food recovery. We develop a novel model that can be used for Monte Carlo style simulation using fitted empirical parameters, and we show that this model reproduces the dynamics observed by CFS. While we believe that this model can represent a large class of similar regions with a mix of rural and urban environments, we are careful to remind the reader that our conclusions may not apply in disparite environments (i.e., dense urban or sparse rural). In future work, we hope to integrate additional data in order to broaden our conclusions and perform a more rigorous validation of our model.Our chief experimental findings in this work are:\nFood supply (waste) events are heavy-tailed and can be well described with extreme value theory “peaks over threshold” models and the generalized Pareto distribution.\n\nThe efficacy of food recovery hinges on the ability to keep rescued food from perishing.\n\nDespite the underlying heavy-tailed process and complexity of the model, the supply appears to be a linear function of the number of participating donors. Hence, doubling the number of participating donors is likely to double the amount of food available.\n\nThe cost of food recovery can be reduced substantially simply by increasing the number of participating donors (and therefore creating more opportunity for food supply events to occur, when they are required by demand).\n\nIn the scenario we studied in north central Colorado, we have shown that there is substantially more food available than what is currently being recovered. Increasing recovery efforts could reduce both hunger and waste in the region.\nIn future work, we will expand this investigation to address additional questions. We are interested in whether this model can be scaled up to a state or national level. It stands to reason that dense urban and sparse rural environments will produce substantially different cost and supply dynamics. However, understanding how these dynamics affect the efficacy of food recovery is an open question. There are approximately 85,000 grocery stores and 566,000 food service organizations in the US [14], [15]. In [16], Bloom suggests that the typical food waste associated with a restuarant is on average 3,000 lbs per employee, per year (or 123 lbs/day for a 15 employee restaurant). Clearly, there is no shortage of potential donors; the important question is whether they are well positioned for recovery and whether the cost of rescue is acceptable.An additional question is one of nutrition. In our current study, we looked at bulk pounds of food without concern for the type. This is a simplification that has bearing on both the economics of the problem (supply and demand) and the basic expiry of the food. Currently, 88% of grocery stores nationally donate some dry goods, 51% donate produce, and 31% donate prepped food and meat [16]. Fresh and healthful foods are the hardest for food banks to acquire since they have a limited shelf life (small ), which is negatively affected by transportation, time, stocking time, and pickup limitations (how many pickups per week are possible). Optimizing pickup strategies to capitalize on small food waste events, and sufficiently funding food rescue organizations so that they have the resources to pickup food when it is available might mitigate this problem. A complete solution might require recovery efforts at multiple scales and with varying technologies.Although preliminary, our work here is an important first step towards understanding the dynamics and limitations of food recovery to mitigate hunger. In the end, we can present the positive result that, despite its underlying complexity, food recovery can be considered a stable process where obtaining additional food is simply a function of having sufficient participating donors and funding to perform pickups. We hope that this work will help to spur interest in this area, equally among researchers who might be able to bring additional insight into the problem, businesses who can agree to donate their food waste, and policy makers who posess the ability to procure needed funding and resources for food rescue organizations to succeed.']"

2013-11-11T00:00:00Z,Tuberculin Skin Test Result and Risk of Death among Persons with Active TB,"['We observed that patients reported to the US surveillance system with culture-confirmed active TB and a negative TST result were significantly more likely to die after initiation of TB treatment than patients with a positive TST result. This relationship persisted even after adjustment for HIV status, site of TB disease, sputum smear AFB status at baseline, drug susceptibility at baseline, age, sex, and origin of birth.Our results are consistent with several smaller studies of children, persons with HIV, and immunocompetent adults where a negative TST in the setting of active disease has been associated with a two to three-fold increase in the risk of death. [10], [11], [19] The risk of death associated with a negative TST at the time of disease is also evident in a native Brazilian population with high rates of anergy (46%), severe clinical manifestations, and high mortality from TB disease [20].The benefit of having a positive TST at the time of disease may have parallels with the effects of BCG vaccination in early childhood. In general, children who have been vaccinated show a transient positive TST response and are less likely to develop disseminated forms of disease, and are less likely to die if they do develop TB disease. [21], [22] Our results suggest that the host immune response in the setting of active TB disease that is measured by a TST might be similar to the immune response triggered by BCG vaccination in children and potentially mitigates against death.Functional differences have been observed in the cytokine profiles of TB patients who are TST-negative and TST-positive including antigen-specific impairments in IL-2, IL-10, and IFN-γ production. [19], [23]–[25] These impairments in cytokine production and subsequent perturbations in the T-helper 1 and T-helper 2 balance of TST-negative patients may result in impaired ability to control TB disease. Poor clinical outcomes of patients with interferon-gamma receptor mutations and other forms of inherited susceptibility to mycobacterial disease also underscore the importance of cellular immune function, the basis of the TST result, in the successful treatment of TB. [26] Together, these observations indicate that patients with a negative TST may not possess adequate immune function to control TB infection, even in the setting of TB treatment. Future research is warranted to examine how the TST result may serve as an indicator of responsiveness to TB treatment.Tuberculin skin testing is considered an adjunctive test to support the diagnosis of TB in the United States. [27] Our data indicate that tuberculin skin testing is not consistently performed as only 56% of patients with TB disease in the surveillance database had a TST result reported. We found that persons with HIV, persons older than 65 years, and persons with extrapulmonary or miliary disease were less likely to have a TST result reported. These groups are also more likely to have a negative TST and so it is possible that the association between TST and death is even stronger than what we found in our analysis. We were not able to determine the effect of other immunocompromising conditions on TST and outcome because U.S. surveillance data prior to 2009 do not include information on conditions, other than HIV infection, such as nutritional status, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal disease, or treatments such as TNF-α antagonists that affect immune function and may impact TST results. [1], [4], [9], [28] Furthermore, data from California, which accounts for approximately 20% of TB cases in the United States, were excluded because HIV results were not routinely reported to CDC. Recognizing these limitations of surveillance data it will be necessary to conduct prospective research to verify the findings of this retrospective observational surveillance data analysis.We recommend increased utilization of the TST in clinical research to systematically evaluate how the TST result may inform clinical care of persons with TB. In addition to serving as a marker of the risk of developing active disease among TB contacts, the TST result appears to be a marker for risk of death in patients with TB disease. However, further research is needed to determine what host or pathogen factors contribute to this increased risk of death observed among patients with a negative TST, and also to determine whether the same associations with death are seen with the newer interferon gamma release assays. Further study of the factors associated with death among patients with a negative TST may help identify strategies to improve survival.']"
2017-05-22T00:00:00Z,Messinian age and savannah environment of the possible hominin Graecopithecus from Europe,"['For the first time we demonstrate that C4 grasses were the dominant herbaceous element of the Pikermi Formation. Our habitat reconstruction suggests fire-prone woody grasslands and woodlands within a savannah biome for Pikermi and Pyrgos and, thus, provides unambiguous evidence for the early environmental conjectures of Gaudry[36]. Given the potential hominin nature of Graecopithecus freybergi, our habitat reconstruction for the Pikermi Formation further supports the “Savannah Hypothesis” put forward to explain earliest hominin emergence[69, 71, 74]. Analysis of both potential hominin sites indicates that Graecopithecus inhabited different habitats, be it open braided-river landscapes in Azmaka[4], or the wooded grassland of Pyrgos.The Tortonian-Messinian transition in the Mediterranean appears to represent a period of significant environmental and climatic changes. During the latest Tortonian (~7.4–7.25 Ma) C4 grass ecosystems progressively penetrate the Balkan Peninsula and constitute the environment of the mammal fauna of Pikermi, which contradicts earlier assumptions [75, 76]. The classical Pikermi fauna is terminated at the beginning of the Messinian (7.25–7.10 Ma) by a significant faunal turnover (post-Pikermi turnover), accompanied by massive increase of Saharan dust and salt accumulation with profound effects on soil salinity and nutrition.Our results reveal formerly unrecognized Mediterranean environmental changes during the Tortonian-Messinian transition, which provide important constraints for the evolution of Graecopithecus freybergi. At the Tortonian-Messinian boundary (7.25 Ma), water-stress levels increased and wildfire frequency decreased, which can be interpreted as increasing aridification. Rather than representing a local phenomenon, aridification occurred on a larger scale. We demonstrate that aeolian dust accumulation was widespread at the northern Mediterranean coast and that large amount of salt-laden mineral dust and marine-based aerosols were blown from dried lake beds in North Africa toward Europe, where ~30-m-thick red silts were deposited in southern Greece and southern France. We relate this dust accumulation to progressive late Tortonian Mediterranean aridification and cooling, which started at around 7.4 Ma and culminated during the earliest Messinian, when Mediterranean Sea surface temperature dropped by about 7°C to values comparable to the present-day (Fig 4,[41, 77, 78]). Modelling studies[79] have shown that Middle Miocene Tethyan seaway closure and accelerated Late Miocene uplift of the Iranian plateau[80] provided key boundary conditions for north African aridity. We hypothesize that the ~700 kyr cooling episode[41], combined with the long-term eccentricity minimum between 7.3 and 7.2 Ma, acted as a final trigger for substantial north African aridization, which resulted in the initial formation of a large Saharan and Arabian desert belt[79, 81]. Furthermore, mineral dust in Attica was rich in soluble evaporites (halite, gypsum) in the earliest Messinian and especially during two pronounced insolation seasonality minima at 7.18 and 7.157 Ma, which suggests an orbitally driven progressive Sahara desertification. We suppose that a latest Tortonian to early Messinian dust- and salt-laden atmosphere over the Mediterranean may have further accelerated cooling and aridification via absorption of incoming solar radiation and, thus, may partially explain regionally accentuated Mediterranean cooling[41].The documented environmental changes were likely to have caused a significant faunal transition. Our dating of Graecopithecus and the taxonomy of its accompanying large mammals indicate that, during culmination of cooling at the base of the Messinian, the post-Pikermi turnover replaced part of the Pikermi fauna. Several newcomers like the elephantoid Anancus or the boselaphid Tragoportax macedoniensis have Asian affinities and we hypothesize that Eastern Mediterranean aridification played an important role in the westward shift of their habitats. Graecopithecus, as part of this new post-Pikermi fauna, lived in a warm-temperate and dusty environment unlike any other known hominid (except for our own genus). Graecopithecus predates by several hundred thousand years the next youngest candidate hominin Sahelanthropus, which occupied the southern Saharan tropics after its earliest Messinian desertification [82]. Given the potential hominin affinity of Graecopithecus, our results suggest that the Pan-Homo split predated the Messinian and that the chimpanzee–human last common ancestor thrived in the Mediterranean region. The emerging Saharan and Arabian desert belt thereby possibly acted as a vicariant agent[83]. Our conclusions support views[3] that major Miocene hominid radiations occurred outside Africa and endorse the hypothesis[5] that the hominin clade arose in the Eastern Mediterranean.']"
2016-06-20T00:00:00Z,AMP-Activated Kinase (AMPK) Activation by AICAR in Human White Adipocytes Derived from Pericardial White Adipose Tissue Stem Cells Induces a Partial Beige-Like Phenotype,"['Beige adipocytes represent a newly described pool of adipocytes with physiologically important capacity of oxidation that is implicated in the pathology of type II diabetes and probably a myriad of other metabolic diseases [7, 43]. Qiang and colleagues have identified the SIRT1 –PPARγ pathway as the central regulator of beige adipocyte differentiation and function [21]. SIRT1, a protein deacetylase, is the member of the sirtuin protein family that was implicated in several human metabolic and degenerative diseases [2, 44]. SIRT1 has central role in the adaptation to fasting and other nutritional or environmental stress. SIRT1 achieves its effects through deacetylating key transcription factors (PGC-1α, FOXO1, FOXO3, p53) that then initiate transcription programs culminating in the suppression of cellular synthetic processes and the induction of cellular catabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis [2, 44]. SIRT1 works in collaboration with other cellular energy sensors such as mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR), hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), nuclear respiratory factors (NRFs) or AMPK [2, 44–47]. AMPK has very similar role to SIRT1, when cellular energy charge decreases marked by increase in AMP levels and the decrease of ATP, AMPK is activated and shuts down energy-consuming anabolic processes and turns on mitochondrial oxidation and catabolism to replenish cellular energy [25, 48].SIRT1 and AMPK not only display functional synergy, but their activity is cross-regulated [25, 49–53]. Several investigators have shown that AMPK and SIRT1 act on the same transcription factors (e.g. PGC-1α) that requires both AMPK-mediated phosphorylation and SIRT1-mediated deacetylation for activation and the subsequent induction of mitochondrial biogenesis [25]. Furthermore, AMPK and SIRT1 are also cross-connected through modulating NAMPT and hence cellular NAD+ salvage [52]. Since the same target transcription factors and SIRT1 were implicated in the differentiation and function of beige cells (e.g. PGC-1α) [15, 17, 21, 22, 54, 55] it was logical to assess the function of AMPK, which is situated upstream of SIRT1, in beige differentiation. This hypothesis was further supported by the fact that AMPK activation is important in brown adipose tissue differentiation, moreover induces differentiation of white adipocyte precursors to brown adipocytes [55–61].We used AICAR for the activation of AMPK [29] and found typical morphological features of beige cells are formed upon AICAR treatment. However, the very necessary induction of mitochondrial biogenesis and the increased expression of the markers of beige differentiation (TBX-1, UCP1, TMEM26, PRDM16, CIDEA) did not take place. It seems that AMPK activation does not induce the formation of functional beige cells in pericardial hADMSCs, but AMPK activation is restricted to the induction of morphological changes. The actual cause of the restricted capability of AMPK in inducing beige differentiation remains elusive. Terminal differentiation of beige cells depend on SIRT1 activation [21], while AMPK is capable of activating SIRT1 [25]. The interconnection between AMPK and SIRT1 relies on the modulation of small molecule enzyme cofactors such as NAD+ [25, 48]. Characteristic differences in the metabolism of these cofactors or low AMPK expression in beige cells may explain blunted response to AMPK activation, although to verify these hypothesis require further investigations.It is a question whether the restricted role of AMPK is true for adipose tissue-derived stem cells of any origin or is it specific for only (a) certain fat depot(s). Indeed, the expression of PRDM16 and TBX-1 in beige cells versus white cells is lower in our study than in another study using stem cells from subcutaneous adipose tissue [14]. Yet the question cannot be answered with certainty, however the known differences between adipose tissue depots [62, 63] makes it likely that AMPK activation may have a more pronounced effect in other adipose tissue depots. It should be noted, however, that this study is the first to report that pericardial adipose tissue-derived stem cells can be differentiated to beige adipocytes.Although several known external stimuli (hormones [7, 14–18], neuronal stimuli [19, 20] or drugs [21, 22]) may activate beige cells, the intracellular signal transduction pathways that translate these signals are still to be elucidated. It seems that β-adrenergic stimulus and signals induce beige adipocyte function [64, 65]. However, serotonin (5HT) had been shown to blunt thermogenic activity in brown and beige cells in mice [66, 67]. Our data nominate the energy and nutrient sensing system as possible actors in beige function and in signal transduction. Along the same line, there is a vast area of metabolic processes and drugs yet not investigated with regard to beige function, such as fasting and exercise mimetics, metabolic drugs and proteins, regulatory circuits of feeding and fasting or circadian rhythm—our data presented here clearly point out the vast potential of they may provide.']"
2019-01-17T00:00:00Z,Better soils for healthier lives? An econometric assessment of the link between soil nutrients and malnutrition in Sub-Saharan Africa,"['This paper reveals a significant link between spatial variation in African soil fertility and spatial variation in child health. We are not aware of earlier studies that have identified such a relation in statistical detail. In establishing this link we use estimates [18] on densities of nine macro- and micronutrients, as well as estimates on soil organic matter content, to proxy for variation in soil fertility. We subsequently assess the precise causal effect of spatial variation in these elements on incidences of child mortality, stunting wasting and underweight. We argue that these effects serve as a good proxy for assessing the magnitude of the impact of agronomic fortification -enriching inorganic fertilizers with micronutrients- as a means to alleviate malnutrition or hidden hunger.We find that joint increases in micronutrients (zinc, copper and manganese) lead to significant reductions in incidences of child mortality, stunting, wasting and underweight, specifically in areas where malaria pressure is relatively low. In regions with higher malaria pressure the effect dissipates. Greater (joint) densities of soil calcium and magnesium lead to taller children, all other things being equal, leading to increases incidences of child wasting and underweight, but to reductions in the incidences of child stunting. Finally, joint increases in soil nitrogen and organic matter content reduce incidence of child mortality and wasting. Overall the magnitude of these effects is noteworthy. A joint standard deviation increase in zinc, copper and manganese densities reduces child mortality by 4 per mille points at the median malaria intensity (from an average mortality rate of 44 per mille). For relatively low malaria pressure (1st quartile) such a micronutrient increase leads to reductions in stunting, wasting and underweight of around 2–3 percentage points (from averages of 39, 10 and 21 percentage respectively). In other words, you are what you eat, at least in the case of Sub-Saharan Africa, which in turn is also shaped by local soil conditions.These findings do suggest that building up soil nutrient stocks through agronomic fortification has its merit in reducing malnutrition and improving health. Various recent studies already document the benefits of including micronutrients in regular inorganic fertilizers as a means to increase agricultural production and productivity [10, 16] These effects on improving child health may thus be considered a co-benefit or external effect. These co-benefits inhibit a strong public good nature. Improved nutritional quality in agricultural produce is unlikely to attract a higher price in markets in SSA, next to various studies that reveal suboptimal individual spending on health goods and services to begin with. We are aware of only one study that links nutrient content of agricultural produce with actual farmer marketing decisions [58]. This study reveals that Ugandan farmers typically market produce with lower zinc content and self-consume produce with higher zinc content. In other words, these reasons may justify government subsidization of inorganic fertilizers enriched with missing (micro-)nutrients.However, the cost-benefit analysis presented in the second half of this paper dampens the enthusiasm for presenting agronomic fortification as an omnipotent and efficacious instrument to combat malnutrition. We find that in many instances the costs per DALY averted are relatively high. Only in those areas where population density is high, as well as likely levels of agricultural intensification, is agronomic fortification likely to be a cost-effective alternative. This argument is shaped by both the fact that the per capita cost of agronomic fortification is lower in such areas, next to the fact that inorganic fertilizer use is more common to begin with. Conversely, in areas with lower population densities alternatives like nutrient supplementation (in capsules or powders), food fortification, possibly in combination with genetic fortification are likely to be more cost-effective.Malnutrition continues to place a great burden on human health and development in Sub-Saharan Africa now and in the foreseeable future. The potential economic opportunities in reverting malnutrition are huge. But, solid information on cost and benefits of the various policy options, and how these differ, across regions and countries remain scarce. In filling this gap, this study made a contribution to better understand the potential for using agronomic fortification to revert malnutrition. Even though we argue that our approach provides realistic and robust insights into the potential of agronomic fortification, it remains second-best to urgently needed on the ground experimental approaches. Hence, the results from this study point to areas–high population density and low micronutrient densities- that most likely harbour the greatest potential for using agricultural fortification as a means to combat malnutrition. Such locations should be targeted first with actual field trials in which micronutrient enriched fertilizers are distributed and impact on both agricultural productivity and health indicators are monitored. Moreover, combining such trials with data collection on actual food consumption will allow for a better understanding on the precise causal channel through which changes in malnutrition may come about.']"
2014-01-31T00:00:00Z,"The Invisible Cliff: Abrupt Imposition of Malthusian Equilibrium in a Natural-Fertility, Agrarian Society","['Societies are complex systems linking natural and social features [44]; their study requires models that do the same, while drawing on comparative, historical and prehistorical records [45]. The modeling effort we describe instantiates these goals in a population ecology approach that embodies the fundamental principles discussed by Turchin [46]: exponential growth, self-limitation and consumer-resource oscillation. With Turchin [47], we take population ecology models to be tools for seeking understanding of regularities in history.Colonizing populations or those recovering from an epidemic or other catastrophe so that they are faced with comeback in a relatively empty habitat will enjoy a lengthy period of comfortable growth before they hit a quick transition to deprivation of indefinite length. Except for a very brief transition, populations in which fertility and mortality are density dependent will exist in one of two states: comfortable or deprived. This runs counter to intuitions formed by familiarity with variants of the logistic equation.We propose that growing populations in the copial phase have few means of detecting their fate more than several generations in advance of it being fully upon them. It lurks like an invisible cliff. Their Malthusian transition interval (MTI) is short. From initial settlement, the growth rate of colonizers remains constantly high and population size increases at an accelerating rate. Justifications for complacency abound. Surplus food availability declines but until food availability drops below the critical value of E\u200a=\u200a1, quality of life variables like life span, infant survival and fertility are unaffected by habitat in-fill. Absent nutritional or demographic strain felt at the household level, swelling aggregate population size is unlikely to be perceived or monitored as a signal of pending trouble. Similarly, we do not expect individuals to anticipate crisis from a declining surplus; food availability in excess of need weakens the signal. Growth rate (r) by contrast reflects palpable and personal linkages among mortality, fertility and hunger, and it or its constituent vital rates should constitute a strong household signal of environmental difficulty. However, these are constant until a few generations before the Malthusian equilibrium. The most informative and directly reliable signals, those entailing hunger and acute changes in mortality and fertility, offer virtually no lead-time.The brevity of the MTI limits options for response if adaptations require a long lead time or heavy investments of planning and implementation. It is difficult to envision that a society could successfully undertake the introduction of facilities like extensive irrigation canals, terracing or raised fields on the timespan of a couple of generations after perceiving their need, during a crisis. In a sanguine conclusion to his review of the “Archaeology of Overshoot and Collapse,” Tainter [28]:72 says:\n“overshoot is teleological, as if humans could set a target for population or consumption…[it] denies the human capacity for flexible adjustments…It usually is possible to coax more resource production by applying capital and technology, increasing labor, applying energy subsidies, and making production more knowledge-intensive.”\nGiven realistic appraisal of how unexpectedly and quickly they may impose themselves, population crises may offer little opportunity for the kind of adjustments Tainter envisions.These observations also suggest, however, that we should be cautious in extrapolating from the fate of places like Easter Island to our own situation [48]. The collapse of Pacific Island societies sometimes is portrayed as a failure to recognize the need for adaptive response. Plentiful signs were not read or were ignored, reasonable adjustments were not made, and social upheaval ensued when population finally exceeded resource capacities (cf. [49]). But this reading of the evidence entails a Lotka-Verhulst version of the world in which human failures are measured by long-standing neglect of distress signals. Our results suggest that the very salubrious Pacific Island setting is precisely the one in which the signal would anticipate problems by the slimmest of margins, perhaps coming too late for an effective response no matter how conscientious the population.Many models that place population at the heart of social upheaval envision linked resource degradation as the ultimate cause. Overexploitation provokes deteriorating yields or, in the Maya case “a population collapse precipitated by agricultural failure” [50]:141. This combination of causes may well have been the case historically. But it is important to acknowledge that population can act abruptly and with severity even in the absence of an environmental crisis. In our analyses the environmental capacity to yield resources is not declining; our plunge to Malthusian constraints does not invoke factors like reduced yield, forest clearance or soil erosion. Rather, the fate of the population resides primarily in the responses of fertility and mortality in the face of calorie shortages. Population stress and collapse might arise from punctuated demographic failure quite apart from environmental manifestation of resource overexploitation. Abrupt imposition of Malthusian constraints and insufficient MTI may well be a stand-alone culprit in social evolution.']"
2015-07-24T00:00:00Z,In Vivo Detection of Perinatal Brain Metabolite Changes in a Rabbit Model of Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR),"['We have used a rabbit model of IUGR to assess in vivo brain structural and metabolic profile changes at the time of delivery. Low birth weight in these animals was associated with smaller brain sizes, slightly lower brain temperatures during anesthesia, and metabolite profile changes in different regions of the brain parenchyma. Specifically, we found apparent lower levels of aspartate and NAA in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and higher glycine in the striatum. MRS patterns analysis further suggests that the changes in cortex are the most prevalent.The number of stillbirths and the birth weights in each group are in good agreement with the literature for this model [11,12,15], as well as the smaller brain sizes in IUGR pups [12,17]. A previous study on the same animal model of IUGR, showed predominant metabolite changes in the hemispheric regions at the time of birth, using frozen brain samples [17]. Specifically, the strongest differences between IUGR and control samples were found in asparagine (derived from aspartate), NAA, and pyroglutamic acid (a cyclic form of glutamate or glutamine), all decreased in IUGR brains [17]. These results are consistent with our data of lower apparent aspartate and NAA in both cortex and hippocampus, and slightly lower glutamate in the hippocampus.A similar rabbit model of IUGR was also used to investigate brain metabolite changes in frozen tissue sections, collected from the same brain regions that we investigated [35]. However, some methodological differences between the two models may explain some of the different results obtained. In their study, occlusion was milder (30–40%) and performed earlier in gestation (day 21); and delivery was also later (day 32), which is in accordance with the higher birth weights reported by the authors (controls +16%; IUGRs +74%) [35]. This alternative approach showed significantly higher levels of glutamate (and dopamine) in all IUGR brain regions studied, along with lower GABA in the striatum; whereas we could not detect any significant changes in GABA but noticed a slight glutamate decrease in IUGR, mostly in the hippocampus. Moreover, previous studies comparing these two animal models of IUGR showed signs of cortical brain damage mostly in our model of IUGR (higher S100β expression), as well as very distinct patterns of cell proliferation in each brain region according to the timing and degree of the ligation [12]. This could explain to some extent the metabolic differences reported by the other group [35], supporting that the effect of IUGR on brain metabolism is dependent on the brain region but also on the degree and timing of the insult, according to the maturation stage of each brain region.Our results also agree with recent clinical findings suggesting lower brain NAA levels in IUGR fetuses [9,10]. The stronger prevalence of metabolite pattern changes in the cortex region of IUGR brains is consistent with impaired neurodevelopmental performance detected in IUGR infants at 2 years of age, mostly related to frontal brain networking [36].As to the pathophysiologic explanation of our findings, the decrease of NAA (a neuronal marker and major precursor for myelin synthesis in oligodendrocytes) in the cortex and hippocampus of IUGR pups spatially correlates with the lower fractional anisotropy previously reported in this animal model at postnatal day 1 [14], which is indicative of decreased axonal packing in those regions—lower neuronal density, organization and/or myelinization. Then, the decrease of estimated aspartate levels and slight reduction of glutamate (two major excitatory neurotransmitters) would also agree with previous results with this model of impaired motor activity and olfactory function at postnatal day 1 [14], and anxiety, attention and memory problems at postnatal day 70 (pre-adolescent equivalent age) [15]: symptoms potentially related to impairments in parietal, frontal and cingulate cortex and hippocampus. Moreover, while the reduced brain/body temperatures during anesthesia agree with previous results in small animals [27,37,38], the lower cortical temperatures in the IUGR brainswould also agree with the clinical evidence of inefficient thermoregulation in low birth weight infants [39,40]. The latter observation suggests lower cortical metabolic activity, which could also explain the metabolite profile changes detected in this region. Altogether, these changes indicate impaired cellular metabolism due to sustained hypoxemia, under-nutrition, and apparent enhanced brain hypothermia in IUGR, most noticeable in products of mitochondrial aerobic metabolism in cortical and hippocampal regions (Fig 4). This is in agreement with previous results with this model [17] as well as with recent clinical findings [9,10].\n10.1371/journal.pone.0131310.g004\nFig 4\n\nMetabolic model of IUGR impairment in cortex and hippocampus regions.\nSustained hypoxemia (lower oxygen, O2) and under-nutrition (lower glucose, Glc) during IUGR lead to impaired brain metabolism, noticed in vivo as a decrease in products of aerobic metabolism (tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (2)): Asp, NAA, and Glu. Basic metabolite shuttling between neurons and glial cells according to the literature [50,51,52]. (1) Glycolysis; (3) fatty acid synthesis; alpha-ketoglutarate (αKG); glucose (Glc); oxaloacetate (OAA).\n\n\nThe different profile of metabolite changes detected in the striatum (increased estimated levels of glycine and mixed pool of myo-inositol and glycine) compared to cortex and hippocampus, could be linked to different metabolic requirements in this region, where myelinization occurs earlier than in cortical regions. Since previous studies in rabbits showed acute injuries in the basal ganglia and thalamus due to prenatal hypoxia [41], the significant increase of estimated glycine levels (~10-fold higher in the normal fetal rabbit brain than in young animals [42]) could be a response to hypoxia during IUGR. This would agree with other studies showing a cytoprotective role for glycine [43,44], specifically by inhibiting apoptosis in brain cells during glucose and oxygen deprivation [45], which could in turn explain the apparent lower brain damage in the basal ganglia compared to cortex, in this model of IUGR [12]. Moreover, our results agree with recent clinical observations of an increased mixed pool of myo-inositol and glycine (relative to total choline) in the basal ganglia of fetuses with severe congenital heart disease, which is considered a model of brain development under chronic hypoxia [46].Moreover, since the first feature objectively selected for MRS pattern classification was consistently 3.55 ppm, in the cortex region, this suggests that glycine, and/or myo-inositol, may also be altered in this region during IUGR but not readily quantifiable by model fitting. Accordingly, the estimated glycine levels were slightly elevated in IUGR cortex (+9%). Although selecting additional features for classification ultimately leads to classifier overtraining (features selected <1/3 spectral vectors available [47,48]), it is interesting to notice that those include 2.0 ppm and 3.15 ppm. While the former correlates with the NAA peak and therefore agrees with the quantitative differences estimated between groups, we found no significant metabolite differences around 3.15 ppm, i.e. estimated phenylalanine or choline compounds. Although we could detect free choline in our preliminary tissue extract NMR experiments, we did not select it for quantification (in agreement with the literature [28]) due to its much lower abundance in vivo compared with glycero-phosphocholine and phosphoryl choline, and also its overlap with phosphorylethanolamine.This study has relevant clinical implications, since the brain metabolic changes detected support previous findings in fetal brain metabolite levels during IUGR [9,10] and correlate well with associated structural changes and neurodevelopment problems. The in vivo detection of these metabolites suggests their potential role as non-invasive biomarkers for the perinatal clinical diagnosis/monitoring of IUGR and other related diseases.We acknowledge some limitations in our work. We cannot rule out possible mixed effects of anesthesia and (non-physiologic) brain hypothermia, and/or an acute response to the conditions outside the uterus in our model, which can impact brain metabolism. However, both IUGR and controls underwent the same procedures. Also, due to the small size and asymmetry of the different brain tissues, we were not able to fully position each MRS voxel within the respective tissue, although we assured their major relative contribution compared to nearby tissues. Then, selecting a shorter repetition time than in other small animals studies [28,49] was a compromise to acquire data in a timely manner, due to the difficulty in keeping newborn rabbits anesthetized for long periods. Although this induced some T1 saturation in our signals, the total creatine levels were similar to those obtained ex vivo; and most importantly, this should not affect the comparison between IUGR and controls. Moreover, the model basis sets for macromolecule fitting were taken from standard references and visual inspection of our data. Improving this performance would required metabolite suppression techniques [28], which were not available in our case. Still, no significant differences were detected in estimated macromolecule (or mobile lipid) contributions between IUGR and controls.The stronger aspects of this work rely on the well characterized animal model of IUGR used that reproduces many clinical features of this disease [12,13], as well as the in vivo assessment of brain metabolite changes at the time of birth, which complements previous studies post-mortem with this model [17,35]. We have used MRS with high spatial resolution (voxel volume ~10 μl) and an echo time about 2-fold shorter than typically available in the clinic (≥20 ms). Thus, by carefully positioning the newborns in the animal holder and keeping them stably anesthetized (not trivial with newborn rabbits), we acquired good quality MRS data that enable a timely detection of low concentrated brain metabolites in different brain regions, reaching statistical significances with a relatively small animal cohort. Additionally, we used two independent approaches for MRS analysis, based on metabolite quantification and spectral pattern classification. This re-enforced our results since the two techniques are complementary, and the stronger metabolite differences estimated between groups do not necessarily represent the best spectral pattern features for classification.To conclude, a well established animal model of IUGR showed differential metabolic profile changes in cortical and subcortical brain regions, with the most prevalent changes noticed in the cortex. This is consistent with postnatal neurobehavioral impairments reported in children and provides insight to the origin of the MRS changes recently reported in small fetuses at term. Future studies with this animal model of IUGR, or others, should investigate the longitudinal brain metabolic changes that parallel structural alterations, to help understanding the extent of IUGR from a biochemical point of view and provide additional biomarkers for its detection at different stages and/or monitor response to therapy.']"
2017-05-01T00:00:00Z,Barriers to care in patients with diabetes and poor glycemic control—A cross-sectional survey,"['In this population-based survey of individuals with diabetes, we examined factors associated with diabetes care and potential barriers to care across several domains, and compared responses from patients with poor glycemic control to those with fair glycemic control. We found that, in general, people with HbA1c ≥ 10% (86 mmol/mol) were younger but in worse health than those with HbA1c 7–8% (53–64 mmol/mol). We found few differences in access to care between groups but noted that patients with HbA1c ≥ 10% (86 mmol/mol) were more likely to struggle with confidence and appeared to have fewer social supports. Financial barriers were significantly more common in patients with HbA1c ≥ 10% (86 mmol/mol), and these were multifactorial. Given the cross-sectional nature of this survey, it is not possible to comment on causation. However, the data may be used to generate hypotheses regarding targeted strategies to improve diabetes management and outcomes in this population.Disparities in glycemic control in this population are unlikely to be related to lack of access to care. Those with HbA1c ≥ 10% (86 mmol/mol) reported seeing their family physician and other members of the health care team (allied health practitioners and specialists) more often than those with HbA1c 7–8% (53–64 mmol/mol). However, nearly one quarter of patients with HbA1c ≥ 10% (86 mmol/mol) had not seen an allied health care practitioner for diabetes. Given the evidence for improvement in disease control with the use of interdisciplinary teams [14], this represents a potential opportunity to improve care. Further involvement of care teams may also improve perceived coordination of care [14], which was more commonly reported as suboptimal by patients with poor glycemic control.Low motivation to improve self-management skills does not seem to be a common barrier for patients with poor or adequate glycemic control. However, only 18% of individuals with HbA1c ≥ 10% (86 mmol/mol) felt they needed more information, which may reflect low confidence in being able to put information into use. Low levels of social support in this group may be a factor, as lack of social support has been linked to low adherence and low self-efficacy [24, 25]. Similarly, depressive symptoms were more common in the HbA1c ≥ 10% (86 mmol/mol) group, and depression has been associated with low adherence to both lifestyle changes and medications [17, 26, 27]. Treatment strategies that aim to increase patient empowerment, and enhance social support via peer support may be useful in addressing these barriers. Specifically, personalized care planning has been shown to improve self-care and lead to improvements in glycemic control [28].We found that patients with HbA1c ≥ 10% (86 mmol/mol) were more likely to report financial barriers, including not having drug insurance, not getting needed treatments because of cost, and not being able to afford a healthy diet. These results align with studies from other jurisdictions noting an association between cost and glycemic control [17, 29, 30]. Financial barriers increase the risk of non-adherence and are associated with higher utilization of acute care services among chronic disease patients [18, 31]. Our finding may be due to the fact that patients with HbA1c ≥ 10% (86 mmol/mol) were more likely to be under 65 years than those with HbA1c 7–8% (53–64 mmol/mol); financial barriers to obtaining requisite treatments were less common in patients over 65 years, which is the age at which Alberta residents receive universal medication insurance. Access to affordable, healthy food is essential for diabetes self-management and individuals with food insecurity are limited in their ability to prepare appropriate foods and maintain adequate meal spacing [32]. Food insecurity and medication non-adherence often coexist [33, 34]. Increasing access to universal medication insurance and nutritional assistance programs are potential strategies for overcoming financial barriers [34, 35]. Patient navigator programs, in which trained personnel assist patients in accessing available resources, are another potential approach to mitigating financial barriers to care [36, 37].Our study has several strengths, including large sample size, comparison of responses between HbA1c groups, breadth of the survey questions, and excellent response rate. Some limitations are also worth considering. First, our inclusion criteria may have led to underrepresentation of certain ethnic groups due to language restrictions, and limited our ability to reach vulnerable patients who are not regularly accessing care and are less likely to get routine blood work done. Second, patient responses may reflect the specific resources and services available in the region, and potentially limit the generalizability of our findings. Third, we did not capture data for some lifestyle elements (e.g., sleep, description of employment, physical activity and leisure activities) that may influence diabetes self-care. Finally, the cross-sectional nature of the survey prevents us from drawing conclusions regarding causality.In conclusion, we found that patients with poor glycemic control face multiple barriers to care, and though similar barriers were reported by those with HbA1c 7–8% (53–64 mmol/mol), significantly more individuals with poor glycemic control reported financial barriers. Given the heterogeneity of barriers across individuals, tailored strategies to overcome modifiable barriers, in light of the significant financial burden of diabetes, are urgently needed.']"
2018-05-17T00:00:00Z,Maternal human telomerase reverse transcriptase variants are associated with preterm labor and preterm premature rupture of membranes,"['Feto-maternal tissue senescence is a physiological factor associated with term parturition in humans. Premature and pathologic senescence activation in response to various pregnancy-associated risk factors can contribute to preterm labor and delivery.[25] Multitudes of risk factors have been linked to premature senescence activation; mainly oxidative stress inducing factors like infection/inflammation,[32–33] obesity,[34–35] nutritional factors,[36–37] and behavioral risks.[38–39] Oxidative stress induced by these risk factors can accelerate telomere attrition causing early aging and inflammation contributing to either PTL or pPROM. Genetic variation in maternal or fetal telomerase gene may also contribute to this process in the absence of specific risk factors, or an interaction between the two may also predispose to adverse pregnancy outcome. This study examined the existence of any genetic predisposition to PTL and/or pPROM through variations in the telomerase gene.We report that maternal hTERT SNP rs2853690 was significantly associated with both PTL (aOR 2.24) and pPROM (aOR 7.54). Located in the non-coding region near the 3 prime end, the functional role of this SNP is unclear. This SNP is not in obvious linkage disequilibrium with any other variants in hTERT (r2 < 0.36 with all other SNPs in the gene) as determined from 1000 Genomes Project data. We found no significant associations between any of the analyzed fetal hTERT SNPs and PTL or pPROM.The major strength of our study was that the samples came from an established biobank with well-defined phenotypes and well-characterized race and ethnicity. Quality control measures were used to ensure that only subjects with high quality genotyping and only SNPs with high genotyping efficiency were included. Additionally, we analyzed both maternal and newborn samples, allowing us to investigate both the maternal and fetal contributions to risk of preterm birth. Our candidate gene, hTERT, has a biologically plausible role in the mechanisms of PTL and pPROM. And finally, a significant strength of our study is that we adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction, minimizing the risk that the association we found was due to type I error.The study was limited by small sample sizes of cases, especially pPROM. Also, the findings may not be applicable to all populations because our study was restricted to Caucasians. Of interest, the risk allele (A) is at least twice as common in African ancestry populations as compared to European populations (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/), the former being at higher risk for PTL and pPROM).[40,41] However, seemingly inconsistent results are that germline telomere length appears to be longer in African individuals that those of European descent.[30] One explanation for this could be that specific genetic predispositions vary between races/ethnicities. A replication of our data in multiple independent cohorts, particularly in one that includes people of African descent, is essential prior to projecting the usefulness of this SNP as a genetic marker of high risk pregnancy. Another limitation of this study is that we have examined only SNPs in the hTERT gene and their association with PTB and pPROM. Other genetic and epigenetic variations in the hTERT gene may also contribute to functional alterations to hTERT activity or levels, contributing to adverse pregnancy outcomes.Telomerase’s role in uterine and feto-maternal tissues is as area of active research. In women with recurrent implantation failure, expression of endometrial telomerase was enhanced during the implantation window.[42] In pregnancy, it has been shown that hTERT expression in the chorion is increased in the first trimester compared the second and third trimesters.[43] Similarly, telomerase activity level has been shown to be significantly higher in the first trimester in chorionic villi samples.[44] A study of human fetal tissues confirms the same pattern of decreasing telomere length and decreasing telomerase expression across the first trimester.[45]Alterations in telomerase expression/activity have been shown to be associated with pathologic pregnancy states. While increased hTERT expression was noted in chorion cells of preeclamptic patients,[43] decreased telomerase activity has been observed in trophoblasts and placental biopsies from pregnancies affected by intrauterine growth restriction.[46–47] A study of growth discordant twins showed a tendency toward reduced telomerase activity in placental trophoblasts of the smaller twin.[48] While the results are not consistent, they may suggest a link between altered telomerase expression and/or activity and premature aging of fetal tissue leading to placental insufficiency and growth restriction.In our continued work on telomerase’s role in preterm birth, our lab has subsequently performed hTERT gene activity and expression studies. We have found that telomerase has no activity in fetal membranes in the second and third trimesters, nor is it expressed in fetal membranes from either term or preterm placenta, including laboring and non-laboring samples. The lack of telomerase expression and activity in fetal membranes could explain why we see no association between infant genetic variation in hTERT and PTL or pPROM in this study. The lack of expression is also suggestive of unhindered telomere reduction to promote the natural progression of senescence that will eventually result in parturition. This study identifies a biologically plausible candidate gene for replicative studies and contributes to the growing evidence that replicative senescence plays a role in maternal-fetal signaling of parturition.']"
2015-05-28T00:00:00Z,Summary of the DREAM8 Parameter Estimation Challenge: Toward Parameter Identification for Whole-Cell Models,"['Overall, the challenge confirmed that whole-cell model parameter estimation is a formidable problem. Significant work remains to develop efficient parameter estimation methods suitable for high-dimensional, nonlinear whole-cell models. Nevertheless, the challenge successfully expanded the whole-cell modeling community and initiated an important dialogue about how to best estimate whole-cell model parameters.Going forward, several parameter estimation innovations are needed to enable researchers to achieve fully accurate models of complex organisms. First, researchers need to develop automated methods for constructing reduced models which are tractable to numerical optimization. Researchers should pursue both statistical and physics-based reduced models. Ideally, these models will take advantage of the unique temporal and population average structure of most experimental cell biology data.Second, researchers must develop simulation engines that quickly execute whole-cell models. This will enable researchers to more accurately identify parameters by enabling them to quickly explore parameter combinations. This can be accomplished by developing a simulation engine that executes multiple submodels simultaneously and that parallelizes the execution of each individual submodel.Third, researchers must develop distributed optimization algorithms that quickly explore the parameter space. Individual workers should communicate so that workers each learn from each other. These parallel optimization methods will enable researchers to find ensembles of highly optimal solutions.Fourth, researchers must develop visualizations that highlight differences among model simulations. This will help researchers design experiments to select among otherwise equivalently scoring parameters sets. In turn, this will help researchers discover and characterize new biological mechanisms.Lastly, researchers need to develop new high-throughput experimental technologies that characterize single-cell variation and temporal dynamics. High-throughput measurements have enabled whole-cell modeling by greatly increasing their practical identifiability. However, currently researchers still have to estimate variance parameters from systems data. New technologies could enable researchers to more easily estimate variance parameters, as well as test variance predictions.We are optimistic that collaborative efforts such as DREAM will produce these new tools. These tools will enable researchers to build more accurate models of more complex organisms, starting with more complex bacteria such as E. coli followed by single-celled eukaryotes such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, multicellular eukaryotes such as Caenorhabditis elegans, and lastly humans. In turn, these new models will open new avenues for rationally designing microorganisms with unprecedented capabilities and ultimately enable physicians to design personalized medical therapies.\nDREAM8 Parameter Estimation Challenge Consortium\n\nTeam 9\nYucheng Hu1\n1 Zhou Peiyuan Center of Applied Mathematics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China\n\n\nTeam Alucinatori\nMichael Baron1, Kevin Bryson1\n1 University College London, London, United Kingdom\n\n\nTeam Crux\nAndreas Raue1,2, Bernhard Steiert1,2, Jens Timmer1–4, Clemens Kreutz1,2\n1 Institute for Physics, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany\n2 Freiburg Center for Systems Biology (ZBSA), University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany\n3 Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies (FRIAS), University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany\n4 BIOSS Centre for Biological Signalling Studies, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany\n\n\nTeam CU\nBrandon Barker1,3, Elijah Bogart2, Yiping Wang1,3, Dhruva Chandramohan1, Lei Huang1, Kelson Zawack1,3, Alexander A.

2018-09-05T00:00:00Z,Muscle glycogen concentrations and response to diet and exercise regimes in Warmblood horses with type 2 Polysaccharide Storage Myopathy,"['The results of the present study provide a comprehensive owner reported description of the characteristics of PSSM2 in WB and for the first time provide valuable prognostic information with regard to response of PSSM2 WB to current diet and exercise management as perceived by owners. The onset of abnormal exercise responses and behaviors in PSSM2 WB was insidious with an average age of onset of 6 yrs, an age when WB horses are expected to be advancing in their training [23]. The three most common complaints of respondents owning PSSM2 WB were reluctance to collect under saddle, decline in performance, and reluctance to go forward reported by 58%, 67%, 76% of respondents, respectively. These exercise responses were uncommon in the baseline WB population at 0–27%. Respondents also reported that 6–24% of PSSM2 WB had mild lameness, muscle atrophy, muscle fasciculations and intermittent rhabdomyolysis. No horses in the baseline population had fasciculations or rhabdomyolysis whereas 18% had lameness (largely forelimb) or atrophy. Other traits and responses common to both PSSM2 WB and the baseline group included difficulty with canter transitions/leads, poor topline, sensitivity to grooming, resentment to girthing and bucking with frequencies ranging from 9–36% in baseline and 12 to 33% in PSSM2 WB. In a previous study of PSSM in WB and non-WB breeds, which included 25 WB in the present study, veterinarians reported that 66% of 188 PSSM2 WB horses had a gait abnormality and 26% had rhabdomyolysis [14]. To provide a more thorough description of the gait abnormality, participants in the present study were given detailed questions about their horse’s gait and lameness. The results revealed that the gait abnormality in PSSM2 WB consisted largely of an undiagnosed lameness that did not resolve with veterinary treatment in 60% of PSSM2 WB. Supplementing the finding of a gait abnormality by Lewis et. al. 2017, our results indicate that reluctance to go forward and to collect are prominent features of PSSM2 in WB which significantly impact the horse’s performance.The lameness and decline in performance in PSSM2 WB described in the present study may overlap with signs associated with orthopedic disorders. In particular, sacroiliac disease is characterized by poor development of epaxial muscles, asymmetric hind limb muscles, stiffness, unwillingness to work on the bit and poor quality canter [24; 25]. Scintigraphic evaluation is commonly used to diagnose back and sacroiliac disease and was performed in 8 horses in the present study [26]. Of those 8 PSSM2 WB, 4 scans had positive results, but only 1 respondent indicated that their horse had been diagnosed with sacroiliac disease; however, the 3 remaining horses had reported positive uptake in the pelvic area. The overlap in clinical signs and common occurrence of sacroiliac disease in WB certainly suggests that diseases of the back and sacroiliac joint should be ruled out prior to performing a muscle biopsy. Additionally, a wide range of training and saddling issues could also produce many of the performance-related signs seen in PSSM2 horses and it seems prudent to fully explore these issues prior to a muscle biopsy [27].Fortunately, by following the recommended diet and exercise regimes, 80% of PSSM2 WB were reported to show overall improvement as well as a significant decrease in signs of rhabdomyolysis, muscle atrophy, change in behavior and decline in performance. This is in agreement with a 2007 epidemiologic study of WB diagnosed with PSSM that reported 71% of WB with PSSM (type 1 or type 2 not specified) improved with recommendations for a low starch, fat supplemented diet and regular exercise [12]. The reported improvement is also higher than the placebo effect found in a caregiver study in which 40% of owners of dogs with osteoarthritis reported a beneficial effect when they unknowingly administered a placebo [28]. It is important to recognize, however, that although abnormal exercise responses and behaviors improved, one third of respondents felt that their horse’s training had plateaued and 18% felt their horse’s performance had declined after implementing recommendations. The most persistent traits were reluctance to go forward (45% still present), difficulty with transitions (33% still present), reluctance to collect (30% still present), poor topline muscle (30% still present) and muscle fasciculations (24% still present). Thus, owners of PSSM2 WB should be aware that although the majority of horses improve with the current diet and exercise recommendations, half of the horses are unable to achieve the owner’s performance expectations. Sixteen percent of respondents in the survey changed the horse’s discipline to one requiring less collection and 22% of PSSM2 WB were eventually euthanized or donated to a University. Our results suggest that even when following the current diet and exercise recommendations, there are residual effects of the muscle disorder underlying PSSM2. Potentially, this study’s results may have been biased since owners of more severely affected horses could have been more motivated to participate in the study.With the present study design, there was no means to determine how stringently recommendations were followed by horse owners or what specific diet changes were responsible for the perceived improvement amongst horse owners. The most consistent changes in diet made by owners of PSSM2 WB were the addition of a fat supplement in 54% of horses, use of a low starch high fat feed in 51% and supplementation with vitamin E in 71% of PSSM2 WB. Generally, the dietary recommendations may have benefited horses because owners sought nutritional advice ensuring that horses received a balanced diet that was relatively low in starch and sugar, supplemented with fat and contained a quality protein source and vitamin E. Beginning in 2014, recommendations for PSSM2 horses included adding a protein source or amino acid supplement to build topline muscles and providing long and low warm up exercise to relax the back and strengthen topline. Provision of amino acid supplements has been shown to increase muscle mass in exercising horses as assessed by subjective muscle scoring [29]. However, there was no significant difference in performance when comparing horses that received recommendations before 2014 to those after–as shown by 50 vs 44% of PSSM2 WB horses advanced in their training, respectively. A clearer understanding of the basis for PSSM2 in WB and design of controlled diet trials and are needed to optimize diet and exercise regimes for these horses.The diet and exercise regime recommended for PSSM2 horses was originally designed to decrease glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle and improve oxidative metabolism of glycogen and fat during exercise. In PSSM1 horses, the diet effectively lowers serum insulin concentrations which could thereby decrease glucose uptake and decrease activation of glycogen synthase in skeletal muscle [9; 30]. Whereas glycogen concentrations are >1.5 fold normal in PSSM1 WB, a recent study did not find significantly elevated mean glycogen concentrations in the 13 PSSM2 WB studied [14]. Similarly, glycogen concentrations in the present study were not significantly different from horses with no evidence of a myopathy in muscle samples and were lower than PSSM1 horses. However, there was a large variation in glycogen content in PSSM2 WB both in snap frozen and shipped samples. Glycogen continues to be metabolized during shipping, and low levels could be a reflection of continued metabolism; however, control samples were also shipped in a similar fashion. It is possible that the horses with elevated muscle glycogen concentrations represent the extremes within one phenotype embodied by a disorder of glycogen metabolism. Most WB horses diagnosed with PSSM2 had very similar clinical signs and glycogen storage disorders in humans can have variable muscle glycogen concentrations [31]. Alternatively, those PSSM2 WB with glycogen concentrations as high as PSSM1 could represent a group of horses with a separate disease from horses with lower glycogen concentrations. The histopathologic criteria for PSSM2 are nonspecific which increases the possibility that more than one etiology for muscle disease falls under this histopathologic diagnosis. Four horses were later found to have histochemical characteristic of abnormal aggregates of desmin within muscle biopsies suggestive of myofibrillar myopathy (MFM) [22]. This finding again could represent progression of the PSSM2 phenotype or could represent a separate disease entity. Determining whether horses within the PSSM2 diagnosis have one etiopathology, or separate etiologies, will require further biochemical and genetic analyses.An unexpected finding in the present study was the high prevalence of gastric ulcers (32%) confirmed by endoscopy in the PSSM2 WB horses. This is slightly lower than the prevalence of squamous ulceration (40%) reported in Warmblood show jumping horses [32]. It is unlikely that gastric ulcers themselves accounted for clinical signs of PSSM2 in WB horses because many of the horses had been effectively treated for ulcers yet performance problems persisted. The higher prevalence of ulcers in the PSSM2 WB could be related to high exercise frequency and performing at competitions; information that was unfortunately not obtained in our study [33].The authors acknowledge the limitations of the present study, particularly that the results of the questionnaires are based on the perceptions of owners with varying levels of experience, and not those of a veterinarian.In summary, the results of the present study indicate that PSSM2 in WB has a strong impact on performance affecting a horse’s willingness to collect and go forward. By following diet and exercise recommendations, exercise responses appear to improve in 80% of horses; however, 30–45% of horses have residual signs that impacted the horse’s ability to advance in training. While a small proportion of PSSM2 WB had elevated muscle glycogen concentrations, the majority of PSSM2 WB had concentrations at or below concentrations in horses without histopathologic evidence of a myopathy.']"
2017-01-19T00:00:00Z,Perinatal Choline Supplementation Reduces Amyloidosis and Increases Choline Acetyltransferase Expression in the Hippocampus of the APPswePS1dE9 Alzheimer's Disease Model Mice,"['These data show that high dietary choline consumption by mouse mothers throughout pregnancy and nursing ameliorates two central pathophysiologic features of their AD model APP.PS1 offspring: accumulation of amyloid plaques and reductions in CHAT protein levels in the hippocampus. The characteristic age-dependent progressive amyloidosis in brain of the APP.PS1 mice [45, 62] was dramatically attenuated by an increased supply of choline during fetal and early postnatal development.Consistent with previous studies, males accumulated Aβ peptides and generated amyloid plaques more slowly than the females [63–65]. Perinatally choline-supplemented males exhibited dramatic resistance to Aβ buildup measured by ELISA and Western blot assays. However, choline-supplemented males and females showed nearly equal reductions in the number and area of Aβ40 and Aβ42 immunoreactive plaques. The latter observations suggest that while the mechanisms that control brain amyloidosis in APP.PS1 mice are sexually dimorphic, the anti-amyloidogenic mechanisms engendered by high choline supply during development operate efficiently in both sexes. Our data showing that perinatal choline supplementation increased the hippocampal levels of β-CTF in both sexes is consistent with this notion. Moreover, the pattern of reduced levels of Aβ peptides together with increased levels of β-CTF in brain of perinatally choline-supplemented animals is reminiscent of what is observed in AD mouse models treated with certain inhibitors of γ-secretase [66–68]–the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of Aβ by hydrolyzing β-CTF. Thus, the mechanism underlying amelioration of amyloidosis in our choline supplemented APP.PS1 mice may be potentially mediated by reduced activity of γ-secretase. Similarly both male and female choline-supplemented APP.PS1 mice were resistant to the 30–40% decline in the hippocampal CHAT protein levels observed in mice reared on the control diet. The vulnerability of the septohippocampal cholinergic neurons to the pathophysiologic process of AD is commonly considered to be mediated by the toxic actions of Aβ peptides [69]. Our observations are consistent with this idea, however, we note that CHAT levels reach their nadir already at 9 months–a time when accumulation of hippocampal Aβ peptides and amyloid plaques in APP.PS1 mice is far from complete. Thus, it is possible that the anticholinergic actions of Aβ are saturated at low levels of the peptide, as seen in our previous studies in cell culture [69], or that they occur in the septum in the milieu of the cholinergic neuron somata, a region generally free of amyloid plaques (data not shown), rather then the hippocampus.AD model mice, including the APP.PS1 mice, reportedly exhibit impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis as they age [70–73]. In this study, both the 9- and 12-month-old APP.PS1 mice had similar expression of DCX–a marker of newly-born, immature neurons [74]–as the WT mice suggesting no marked defects of neurogenesis in these mice. However, consistent with previous studies in rats [16, 59, 60] and Ts65Dn Down’s syndrome (DS) model mice [30], perinatal choline supplementation significantly upregulated dentate gyrus DCX staining and hippocampal DCX levels in both WT and APP.PS1 mice. Thus, high choline supply in early life appears to program the hippocampal neurogenic niche to support robust neurogenesis in adulthood. It remains to be determined if this effect of choline is due to its actions on the early maturation of the neuronal stem/precursor cells in the dentate gyrus per se or due to the modulation of the trophic environment of these cells. While there are no data on the former, the latter possibility is supported by the observations that the levels of multiple growth factors known to stimulate dentate gyrus adult neurogenesis [75] are increased in the hippocampus of perinatally choline-supplemented rats and mice. The list of such choline-responsive factors includes: NGF [15, 76], BDNF [15, 59], VEGF [60], IGF1 [15, 17], and IGF2 [77, 78].Consistent with previous studies [79, 80], including ours [64, 81], the APP.PS1 mice were characterized by hippocampal gliosis as determined by GFAP immunofluorescence and protein level assays. This gliosis was nearly eliminated by perinatal choline supplementation. Given that activation of glial cells in AD and in AD mouse models may be initiated by Aβ peptides [61], it is possible that reduced gliosis in perinatally choline-supplemented APP.PS1 mice is secondary to the amelioration of the amyloidosis seen in these animals. However, in previous studies we observed that prenatal choline supplementation in rats similarly attenuated increases in hippocampal GFAP expression evoked by seizures [16]. Taken together the data indicate that high choline intake during development may have long-term anti-inflammatory actions in brain.The age-associated amyloidosis of AD is the result of the accumulation of Aβ peptides that are produced by proteolytic processing of APP [82]. Similar amyloidosis is found already at a young age in the brains of patients with DS [83], caused by the inheritance of an extra copy of chromosome 21 that harbors the APP gene. Because the murine App and human APP genes encode proteins with somewhat different amino acid sequences, the murine Aβ peptides do not aggregate and thus produce no amyloid. For this reason, mouse models of AD (including the APP.PS1 mice) are engineered to express various forms of the human APP. However, models of DS have been generated (e.g. the Ts65Dn line [84]) by producing animals with an additional copy of a portion of murine chromosome 16 that is syntenic with the DS critical region on the human chromosome 21 [85]. These mice exhibit various morphological, cognitive, behavioral and brain defects that model DS [86]. Interestingly, perinatally choline-supplemented Ts65Dn mice are somewhat protected from attention and memory impairments [25, 28, 30], structural abnormalities in BFCN [25–27], and deficits of hippocampal neurogenesis [30]. These data, together with the current results, raise the possibility that some of the abnormalities seen in brains of the Ts65Dn and APP.PS1 mice may be mediated by common mechanisms related to overexpression of the amyloid precursor protein (App in the Ts65Dn mice and mutant APP in the APP.PS1 mice, respectively) or its proteolytic products [82], including the murine or human Aβ, and not necessarily by the toxic actions of the human Aβ peptides.The overall mechanisms of action of high choline intake during fetal and early postnatal development on adult brain structure and function remain to be determined but are likely related to the metabolism of choline for use in the synthesis of membrane phospholipids (e.g. phosphatidylcholine) and as a precursor of ACh. Moreover, following enzymatic oxidation to betaine, choline functions as a methyl group donor and as such influences DNA and histone methylation–two central epigenomic processes that regulate gene expression [87]. Indeed, we [88, 89], and others [90–93] have shown that perinatal availability of choline dramatically alters brain DNA and histone H3 methylation. In an earlier set of studies we found that prenatal choline intake modulates the methylation patterns of the regulatory DNA elements in the gene encoding IGF2 [88], and that IGF2 mRNA and protein levels are dramatically upregulated by prenatal choline supplementation in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of rats [77, 78]. IGF2 is highly expressed in the choroid plexus and secreted into the CSF [94, 95], and thus may exert global influence on the brain. Previous studies showed that intrahippocampal injections of IGF2 in young rats [96–98] and mice [99, 100] enhances memory function, whereas antagonizing the action of endogenous IGF2 impairs memory [96, 99, 101] indicating the possible role of brain-derived IGF2 in this process. IGF2 upregulates the proliferation of neural stem cells in the dentate gyrus [102], and intrahippocampal injections of IGF2 promote the survival of adult-born neurons in the dentate granule cell layer [99, 100]. In addition, we [78], and others [103] found that IGF2 increases the release of ACh from BFCN. Most importantly, we reported that intracerebroventricular IGF2 infusion ameliorates the amyloidosis and the cholinergic defect in the APP.PS1 mice [81]. In this study, choline supplementation increased IGF2 levels and prevented the reduction in IGF2 protein observed in APP.PS1 mice. Thus, it is possible that many of the actions of high choline intake observed in this study are mediated by IGF2.Our study used a mouse model of AD that causes severe AD-like pathology due to the overexpression of mutant APP and PSEN1 genes that cause hereditary forms of the disease in humans. We found that the severity of the AD-like symptoms in this model can be significantly attenuated by the supplementation of maternal diet with choline during pregnancy and nursing. The vast majority of human AD is sporadic with no known causes and even though its prevalence is alarming, reaching over 30% in individuals over 85 years of age [104], the disease does not appear to be an inevitable result of aging. Some of the factors that prevent or forestall AD have may be genetic; e.g. non-carriers of the APOE ε4 allele [105–108] or individuals who inherited the rare APP A673T allele [109] may be somewhat protected. Our study suggests that vulnerability to AD may be modified by early-life nutrition and further support the notion that adequate intake of choline during pregnancy and nursing in an important public health goal.']"
2014-01-23T00:00:00Z,Acute High Fat Diet Consumption Activates the Mesolimbic Circuit and Requires Orexin Signaling in a Mouse Model,"['In the current study we provide evidence that acute HFD consumption recruits centers of the mesolimbic pathway including neurons of the VTA, NAc, CeA and LHA. Remarkably, we found different responsiveness of PBP, PN and IF sub-regions of the VTA to acute HFD consumption. In terms of the neuronal circuit recruited by acute HFD, we show that orexin signaling is necessary for the spontaneous consumption of HFD and for the HFD-induced activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system. In support of this possibility, we show that HFD-responsive orexin neurons of the LHA innervate the VTA.Current findings support the notion that brain circuits driving motivation to consume a palatable food are a powerful system that can override homeostatic signals [4]. In our experimental test, mice exposed to a HFD pellet spontaneously consumed ∼1.22 kcal, which represents nearly a fifth of their daily food intake, in a short period of time. Of note, satiated mice were exposed to HFD at a time of the day when spontaneous food intake is minimal and while they remained with free access to RC. Thus, this spontaneous consumption of HFD appears to be mainly due to the palatable nature of the stimulus and involve hedonic aspects of eating. In support of this possibility, we observed a strong activation of different nuclei of the mesolimbic system. Importantly, acute HFD resulted in the same profile of c-Fos activation in the mesolimbic pathway in mice that had been previously exposed 2 h to HFD in the previous day (data not shown). Thus, neophobia (i.e. aversion to approach a novel stimulus) or novelty seeking (i.e. enhanced specific exploration of a novel stimulus) seems to play a minor role in our observations. This could be due to the minimal differences in the overall appearance of the HFD and RC pellets. Also, HFD and RC pellets were prepared with the same ingredients though in different proportion. We cannot completely rule out that some degree of neophobia exists in our experimental paradigm. However, the large amount of food intake in HFD-ad lib group and the lack of activation of brain nuclei known to be activated in response to a novel gustatory stimulus [34] suggest that neophobia, if present at all, is transient and minimal. Thus, we propose that the current behavioral test is a suitable model to investigate the neuronal circuits and molecular mechanisms regulating hedonic-related eating behaviors.It is interesting to stress that we included an experimental group consisting of mice exposed to an amount of HFD weight similar to that eaten by control mice exposed to RC. This HFD-pair-fed group was used to distinguish potential effects of the HFD itself from those of higher food intake. Although RC and HFD were not isocaloric, the amount of calories consumed by HFD-pair-fed and control mice were statistically indistinguishable. Thus, HFD-pair-fed and control mice consumed similar amounts of food, expressed either as food weight or calories. HFD ad lib and HFD-pair-fed groups showed similar acute HFD-induced activation of most neuronal populations of the mesolimbic pathway, with the exception of the IF neurons of the VTA that were not activated in the HFD-pair-fed group (see below). Thus, it seems that the acute activation of the mesolimbic pathway is mainly mediated by the HFD itself, rather than the eaten weight or the caloric content.We show that HFD-mediated orosensory stimulation is required for the mesolimbic pathway activation since intragastric administration of HFD failed to increase c-Fos in most of the brain areas under study. Recent studies suggest that dietary fat sensing would involve fatty acid receptors located in the tongue [35]. Then, orosensory taste information is transmitted to the NTS, which directly or indirectly recruits neuronal nuclei in the hindbrain (i.e. PBN), midbrain (i.e. VTA) and forebrain (i.e. NAc and LHA) [36], [37]. Thus, it is possible to hypothesize that the HFD-mediated orosensory stimulation due to the high levels of fatty acids present in the diet, results in the activation of neuronal circuits that end up recruiting the mesolimbic pathway. Post-oral effects of HFD have been proposed to result in overconsumption because fat is less satiating than other macronutrients [38]. In addition, it has been shown that the rewarding value of HFD is determined by its post-oral nutritive effects [39]. Current data stress the importance of the HFD-induced oral stimulation in the acute activation of the mesolimbic pathway, but it does not refute post-ingestion effects of HFD on its rewarding value. One intrinsic limitation of intragastric gavage is that it may cause unusual gastric distention and change the dynamics of nutrient entry to the intestine. In addition, stress associated to the animals handling may mask physiological responses to nutrients. However, this experimental strategy is a valuable tool to dissociate the impact of oral and post-oral signals as demonstrated by previous studies showing that intragastric infusions of glucose can stimulate dopamine system, independently of oral stimulation [40], [41].Here we show that VTA dopamine neurons are significantly activated in HFD-exposed mice. The initial site of action for addictive drugs is known to be predominantly the VTA neurons of the mesolimbic circuit, which then influences many behaviors related to drug addiction [11]. In contrast, the role of VTA neurons in hedonic-driven food consumption is still a matter of debate [10], [13], [14]. It has been proposed that VTA dopamine neurons are responsive to pleasurable foods, or cues that predict it, and also able to promote behaviors directed towards food consumption [5], [42]. VTA contains multiple anatomically and functionally diverse sub-regions [8], [9], [31], [32], [43]. Here we have analyzed c-Fos expression within the VTA sub-regions where dopamine neurons are enriched [8] and found a differential response to the spontaneous HFD consumption. In particular, acute HFD caused a significant activation of dopamine neurons of the PN and PBP sub-divisions independently of the amount of HFD ingested. In contrast, activation of dopamine and non-dopamine neurons of the IF sub-division of the VTA occurred only in mice that over-consumed HFD and the degree of activation correlated with the amount of HFD ingested. The finding that HFD-pair-fed group showed no activation of IF neurons, regardless of their motivation for HFD eating, suggests that these neurons are responsive to the amount of HFD ingested rather than triggering its consumption. Importantly, sub-divisions of the VTA also show differences in terms of their projections and neuronal targets [8]: the PBP and PN dopamine neurons project to the ventrolateral striatum, including the lateral part of the NAc shell and NAc core, while the IF neurons selectively project to the medial part of the NAc shell. Thus, it is possible to hypothesize that sub-divisions of the VTA participate in diverse aspects of hedonic eating. Of note, sub-divisions of the VTA have been shown to respond differently to drugs of abuse, including opiates and alcohol [44]–[47].Acute HFD leads to a strong activation of LHA orexin neurons that is required for the activation of VTA neurons and the full induction of food intake. The LHA is a key brain area that integrates gustatory and visceral information and then modulates different functions, including feeding [17]–[19]. LHA Orexin neurons are involved not only in the regulation of homeostatic food intake itself but also in food reward-related behaviors, including hedonic and motivational components of eating [17]–[19], [25]. In this regard, LHA orexin neurons project to dopamine neurons of the VTA, where orexin receptors are highly expressed and orexin activates both dopamine and non-dopamine neurons [17]–[22]. Orexin signaling is relevant for hedonic eating, as suggested by the finding that orexin-1 receptor antagonism attenuates HFD consumption in rats subject to forced caloric satiation [28]. Interestingly, the hypophagic effect of orexin-1 receptor antagonism occurs exclusively on high fat diet intake and does not affect RC intake [25]–[28]. It has been hypothesized that orexin signaling selectively enhances potentiation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the VTA for highly salient appetitive reinforcers [27]. However, the reason of the specificity of orexin signaling regulating HFD intake is currently unclear. Here we show that spontaneous consumption of HFD was partially blocked in mice administered an orexin 1 receptor antagonist. Thus, we have not only confirmed previous studies but also shown that even spontaneous consumption of HFD in ad lib fed mice requires orexin signaling.Here, we also show that orexin signaling blockade reduced c-Fos induction in the VTA suggesting that orexin neurons are involved in the activation of the mesolimbic pathway. Indeed, we show that most LHA orexin neurons projecting to the VTA increased c-Fos in response to acute HFD. Thus, we conclude that acute HFD may indirectly engage the dopamine neurons of the mesolimbic system by initially targeting orexin LHA neurons which, in turn, project to the VTA. The estimations of orexin-IR fibers density and number of TH-IR neurons contacted by orexin-IR fibers within each VTA sub-region showed no differences. Thus, the mechanisms mediating the differential activation of dopamine neurons of the IF sub-region of the VTA in response to acute HFD will require further studies. Interestingly, we also found VTA innervating neurons of the LHA responsive to acute HFD that were negative for orexin-IR. These LHA non-orexin neurons responsive to HFD may include melanin-concentrating hormone-producing or also neurotensin-producing neurons, which have been shown to reinforce the consumption of calorically dense foods [48], [49]. Of note, a potential involvement of orexin signaling in the VTA mediating the acute stimulation of HFD consumption does not rule out that other neuronal targets of the orexin neurons also participate in this mechanism [22]. Indeed, orexin neurons project to other centers of the mesolimbic pathway known to mediate motivated behaviors, such as the prefrontal cortex, where orexin receptors are highly expressed [50]–[52]. Future studies, using selectively blockade of orexin 1 receptors in these orexin targets, are required in order to elucidate the circuit activated by acute HFD consumption.Acute HFD leads to an activation of NAc, independent of the orexin signaling. The NAc is strategically positioned to translate the affective assessment of food into feeding behaviors since it receives critical orosensory information and then projects to hypothalamic and midbrain areas that contribute to the motor expression of feeding [12], [16], [53]. The NAc contains two functionally different sub-regions: NAc core and NAc shell [18]. The NAc core projects to the basal ganglia pathways to influence voluntary motor functions while the NAc shell projects mainly to subcortical limbic regions, such as the LHA and VTA, and modulates hedonic behaviors [18]. The role of the NAc in feeding behaviors is complex [16], [50], [53]. It has been shown that stimulation of NAc shell neurons by µ-opiod receptor agonists can stimulate HFD consumption by recruiting LHA orexin neurons that, in turn, would activate VTA neurons [16], [50], [53]. Here we show that acute HFD activated c-Fos expression in the NAc shell and that this effect was not blocked by an orexin receptor 1 antagonist. Thus, it is possible to hypothesize that NAc shell is one of the initial neuronal targets recruited by HFD consumption that then further engages other brain systems, including the LHA and VTA neurons. In support of this possibility, it has been shown that the hyperphagia observed in response to intra-NAc shell administration of the µ-opiod receptor agonist DAMGO is blocked by temporary inactivation of the LHA and VTA [53]. Although not a central focus of the current study, we observed that acute HFD also activates c-Fos expression in the NAc core and CeA in an orexin-independent manner.Here, we have used a simple experimental paradigm in mice to provide evidence that clarify our understanding of the brain neuronal circuits recruited by the acute and spontaneous HFD consumption. Hopefully, this information will be helpful to the future development of new strategies for the treatment of conditions in which overconsumption of highly palatable food is observed. For instance, this current protocol could be used to study the neurobiology of binge-eating episodes, which refer to specific events of uncontrollable overconsumption in which the motivation to eat is usually aimed to obtain palatable energy-dense foods [54]–[56]. Episodes of binge-eating are characteristic of patients suffering from several eating disorders including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder [57]–[60]. In addition, binge-eating episodes are observed in obese patients and even in healthy people under specific circumstances, such as stress [61]. Despite its clinical relevance, finding appropriate animal models for studying binge eating episodes has been challenging due to the fact that its etiology in humans is currently unclear [62]. In order to trigger acute food overconsumption, many animal models of binge eating involve a previous period of imposed food restriction, which also affects brain circuits regulating homeostatic aspects of food intake [55], [63], [64]. However, some evidences suggest that binge-eating episodes mainly involve hedonic-related feeding circuits [65]. Here, we show that satiated mice that spontaneously consumed a large amount of HFD in a short period of time have a strong activation of the VTA-NAc-LHA pathway. Therefore, this experimental protocol may be helpful to study the eating episodes in early stages, when the mesolimbic pathway would presumably play a key role [66].']"
